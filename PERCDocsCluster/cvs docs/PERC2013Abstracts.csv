5209,Contributed Poster Presentation,"""Framing"" approaches for promoting a productive non-traditional classroom","This study seeks to understand how STEM instructors ""frame"" non-traditional instruction for their students.  Student resistance can undermine both student learning, or a faculty's commitment to non-traditional instruction.  However, little is known about how instructors communicate with students about their pedagogy in order to mitigate such resistance, or what might be the most effective approaches for doing so.  Anecdotal evidenc suggests that many instructors simply tell students what they will be doing and why, and that what works for some instructors may backfire for others (e.g., women).  Based on a national sample of over 20 STEM faculty, we have arrived at a set of 7 generalized approaches for promoting a positive course climate.  We also report on a pilot survey to determine the popularity and perceived efficacy of these approaches.  Future directions will be discussed.  http://www.colorado.edu/sei/fac-resources/",Stephanie V.

5229,Contributed Poster Presentation,A Board Meeting Resolves A Sharp Disagreement About Friction in The System Schema,"After learning Newtons 2nd Law, students in a university modeling-based introductory physics class are asked to imagine a box sliding across a floor and slowing to a stop. Although theyve had extensive experience with friction in the context of energy, this is their first exposure to friction within the context of force.  They are asked to make and coordinate different representations for this scenario, including a system schema, and force diagram.  During their small group work, students quickly run into a difficulty:  there are only two interactions with the box (contact, gravitational), so there should only be two forces, yet the box is slowing, which means it must have unbalanced forces in the direction of acceleration.  In this paper, I present evidence from a student-led whole-class discussion (a board meeting) showing how the class uses the System Schema to come to consensus after an initial sharp disagreement between small groups.",Brant Hinrichs,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5229,Drury University,,2013

We compare the same students responses from first semester, taught with a standard syllabus, to second semester, taught with extensive life science applications (IPLS). Although first semester responses become less favorable (pre to post), IPLS responses show an increase in favorable and a decrease in unfavorable responses, particularly comparing post-IPLS to post-first semester. This is noteworthy because improvement is rarely observed, even in pedagogically reformed courses. Finally, we analyzed CLASS responses by gender, major, students stated goals in taking physics, and initial interest in physics; initial interest was determined from CLASS items chosen based on the Four-Phase Model of Interest Development. Most notably, we find that in the IPLS course, students identified as having low interest initially had the greatest gains overall.",Catherine H.

We identified brain networks associated with physics problem solving via a quantitative meta-analysis of component cognitive processes such as deductive reasoning, spatial skills, and mathematical calculations. This study assembled functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the BrainMap database [1] and used computational data mining techniques to identify the neural correlates associated with these cognitive processes. The present results were designed to provide groundwork for larger fMRI work in the domain of PER. Ultimately, we aim to use this work as the first phase of a study seeking to identify biological evidence to operationalize engagement, embodied experience, and conceptual metaphor in physics problem solving.

This contrasts with the sequestered problem solving (SPS) perspective which focuses on whether students can solve new problems unaided.  We developed a tutorial to facilitate students understanding and application of mathematical differentiation in physics problems.  One group of students utilized our tutorial, while a control group received a traditional lesson on the same topic.  After instruction, each group completed a SPS transfer task.  Following that they received computer-based hints to aid them on the task.  The extent to which students successfully used these hints assessed their PFL transfer.  We found that students who completed the tutorial did not outperform the control group on the SPS task, but they did outperform them on the PFL transfer task.

5143,Contributed Poster Presentation,Building Modeling Skills and Developing Science Identity in Physics Freshmen,"Acquiring research skills and developing an identity as a scientist are critical to the development of young physicists but often neglected in undergraduate physics courses. While some students develop these traits ""on the job"" as undergraduate researchers, many leave the physics major before experiencing what being a scientist is all about. To counteract this trend, the Berkeley Compass Project offers a freshman course called ""Introduction to Modeling"" that emphasizes the actual practice of science. In it, students engage in model-building through guided activities related to the ray model of light. They then use the skills acquired to conduct research projects guided by graduate student advisors and culminating in papers and a poster session. The students also reflect on their ""scientific identities"" through a series of readings, discussions, and self-evaluations. In this presentation, we discuss the methods and activities used in this course and the positive outcomes experienced by our students.",Joel C.

In this study we investigate the influence of visual cues and correctness feedback on students reasoning as they solve conceptual physics problems containing a diagram. The participants (N=90) were enrolled in an algebra-based physics course and were individually interviewed. During each interview students solved four problem sets each containing an initial problem, six isomorphic training problems, and a transfer problem. The cued conditions saw visual cues on the training problems, and the feedback conditions were told if their responses (answer and explanation) were correct or incorrect. We found that visual cues and correctness feedback significantly improves students abilities to solve the training and transfer problems.

However, little attention has been given to students' technological resources, which are becoming increasingly important.  As ""digital natives"" make up the majority of our student population, a simple change of replacing paper and pencil lab notebooks with digital notebooks may have a dramatic impact on the extent to which students feel valued and respected.  Additionally, digital notebooks are more aligned with the way digital natives have learned to do their work.  Initial results suggest that digital lab notebooks lead to increased student achievement, engagement, and quality of work.

Drawing on both observations of and literature about expert practitioners, we present a framework for the assessment of basic scientific communication models and skills of physicists communicating with non-expert audiences. This framework accounts for different epistemological frames that are activated when experts communicate with experts and with non-experts, and it provides a mechanism to distinguish the models of communication that are engaged in by participants. To demonstrate the utility of this framework, we analyze videos of university physics students explaining physics concepts in both a lecture-style format and in an afterschool setting with middle school children. Using these data, we characterize the physics students scientific communication skills and inferred models of communication.  Among the findings, we can associate communication frames (deficit, dialogue, participation) to pedagogical frames  (transmission, constructivist) along the dimension of participant-centeredness.",Kathleen Hinko,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5268,University of Colorado Boulder,"Cameron Gil

To examine the impacts of level of guidance in inquiry-based activities on students mechanistic reasoning, we analyze middle school students scientific notebooks from an afterschool program by applying a coding scheme that is modified from Russ (Russ, R. et al.. (2008). Sci. Ed., 92: 499525.). We compare students mechanistic reasoning in two inquiry physics curricula, one that is very guided and another that is more open-ended inquiry. We find that students exhibit more types and more overall mechanistic reasoning in the open curriculum. We also code the curricula and find that students have more opportunities to practice mechanistic reasoning in the open-ended curriculum.

We offer evidence that 1) students engage in a rich, iterative process of constructing, critiquing and refining models and terminology in ways characteristic of scientific practice, and 2) students multimodal compositions play a central role in the construction of these models. Of particular importance are structures that allow, and encourage, the use of students own language for composing (Sommers, 1982; Brannon & Knoblauch, 1982; Straub, 1996).

Engaging Students With Scientific Reasoning During Physics Lab Experiments,"Sensemaking during an experiment, such as reflecting and evaluating, is entwined with issues of affect. For example, students may weigh the relative importance of taking in-class time to reflect on activities versus leaving the class early. These decisions often reflect a distinction between their epistemological framing of doing a lab and doing science. This study examines how students reflect during an experiment that involves two common systematic errors. While many students reflected on their results and found the source of the larger systematic errors, very few did so for the smaller one. In fact, for the latter case, many students retroactively increased their initial uncertainties to compensate for the final discrepancy, effectively hiding the systematic inaccuracy altogether.

We found that the acceleration-velocity and force-velocity training significantly improved scores on both of these question types but negatively affected scores on force-acceleration questions, which is inconsistent with hierarchies of student understanding of force and motion found in previous works.  We also found that the force-acceleration training led to slightly lower scores than control, which also breaks the hierarchies and evolution of understanding previously observed.

In this mixed method study we compared students performance in two guided conditions -- constructing an argument and evaluating two arguments --  as well as one control condition.  Our results indicate that the use of guiding prompts improves the argumentation and conceptual quality of students solutions.  Further, students in the guided conditions tended to use more sophisticated problem solving strategies than in the control condition.  We discuss the implications of these results on the use of argumentation prompts on conceptual problems in introductory physics.",Carina M.

5196,Contributed Poster Presentation,Epistemic Games Analysis of Common Exam Questions Across Course Formats,"The focal point of this study was to investigate differences in problem-solving performance between three different introductory physics course formats at Florida International University. The course formats-- lecture+laboratory (LL), inquiry based (IQB), and lecture+laboratory+recitation (LLR)--all incorporated two Advanced Placement (AP) questions into their final exams. Students written responses were evaluated via an AP scoring rubric, and during this scoring, we observed qualitative differences in solution behavior between the three course formats. To further investigate these differences, we used the framework of epistemic games [1,2]  to analyze student responses. To apply this framework to written work, an epistemic game rubric was created. This rubric yielded game profiles for each of the course formats, allowing us to highlight and compare course characteristics. These profiles of game distributions were then examined via chi-squared tests to quantify differences in the tools and strategies students used in their solutions.",Jonathan Vishal Mahadeo,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5196,Primary Researcher,"Adrienne Traxler

Solvers who frequently examine their thinking are able to assess their progress, consider alternatives and evaluate their own work.  In several lower division science, technology, engineering and mathematics courses, students were given class assignments where they were asked to record problem solutions using a think-aloud protocol.  These solutions were recorded using Livescribe smartpens, which record and synchronize pen strokes and audio to create a ""pencast.""  To better understand the self-monitoring process, as well as improve future versions of the class activities, we examined the recorded think alouds after the courses and identified five categories of self-monitoring.

One reason for this extensive use is that many of the items on the FCI have strong distractor choices that correspond to students alternate conceptions in mechanics. Instruction  is unlikely to be effective if instructors do not know the common alternate conceptions of introductory physics students and explicitly take into account students initial knowledge state in their instructional design. We used the FCI to evaluate the pedagogical content knowledge of both instructors and Teaching Assistants (TAs) of varying teaching experience. For each item on the FCI, the instructors and TAs were asked to identify which incorrect answer choice they believed would be most commonly selected by introductory physics students. We used the FCI pre-test and post-test data from a large population (~900) of introductory physics students to assess the pedagogical content knowledge of these educators.

They co-design the lab curriculum with the professor of the lecture section, conduct all lab classes, and grade all student work. In order to investigate how students taking the lab reacted to having undergraduates as lab instructors, we gave and analyzed a short anonymous Likert-type survey probing students' opinions at the end of the second course.

5180,Contributed Poster Presentation,Faculty Discourse in the Classroom:  Meaning in the Math,"The distinction between physics concept and mathematical formalism often seems arbitrary to the physicist. As one faculty colleague put it, ""the concepts are the math and the math are the concepts."" We interpret faculty lectures in the context of frames, defined by Tannen as the contextual surrounding of communication.  But where ""normal"" dialogue requires both parties to agree to the particular frame, the unidirectional nature of lecture can result in an important mismatch between faculty and student expectation, particularly about the underlying reasons behind a mathematical manipulation.  In this work we link classroom frame with symbolic forms, a structure proposed to explain how physicists embed conceptual meaning in mathematics. These forms reveal a multi-faceted view of equations and derivations, with simple mathematical operations resulting in profound shifts in meaning. We find faculty using these to move seamlessly between frames, switching, for example, between the conceptual and mathematical. These changes in frame can be explicit, as is the case with a deliberate re-writing of an equation, or implicit, and, as a consequence, students may not detect a frame change and therefore answer inappropriately or erroneously. These analyses lead discussion of pedagogy in a new direction, one that strikes at the heart of what it means to understand a mathematical representation.",Scott Franklin,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5180,Rochester Institute of Technology,Jonathan Lindine,2013

The research reported here investigated the experiences of first-time physics LAs taking into account the goals of the program and the learning philosophies implicit in the design of the LA experience. Analysis of interviews with LAs and LAs written reflections, demonstrated a common theme across LAs concerning the importance of student/teacher relationships in learning. The LAs views on relationships focus on issues of teacher approachability and authority. Inferences are made about the critical aspects of the LA model related to LAs learning.

One aspect of this endeavor involves having students grapple with the physical processes underlying heuristics that they bring to our course from their biology and chemistry classes.  In particular, we have implemented a series of activities and problems intended to unpack the hydrophobicity of oil, a key step in understanding the formation of cell membranes.  Student reasoning about this process illustrates the challenges and affordances of trying to bridge physics and biochemistry curricula.  Understanding the spontaneous separation of oil and water requires careful consideration of the sometimes competing effects of energy and entropy.

Doing so showed us that the difficulties they had with some questions had nothing to do with their understanding of physics.  These difficulties involved diagrams, notations, and vocabulary that make perfect sense to physics teachers but can easily confuse beginning students.   Based on these interviews, we attempted to clarify some of the FCI questions and then conducted more think-aloud sessions.  After two iterations, the third set of interviews revealed student difficulties which clearly centered on the physics.

The concept of negative energy problematizes the substance ontology for energy, but in many instructional settings, the specific difficulties around negative energy are outweighed by the general advantages of the substance ontology.  However, we claim that our interdisciplinary setting (a physics class that builds deep connections to biology and chemistry) leads to a different set of considerations and conclusions.   In a course designed to draw interdisciplinary connections, the centrality of chemical bond energy in biology necessitates foregrounding negative energy from the beginning.  We argue that the emphasis on negative energy requires a combination of substance and location ontologies.  The location ontology enables energies both above and below zero. We present preliminary student data that illustrate difficulties in reasoning about negative energy, and the affordances of the location metaphor.",Benjamin W.

Due to limited language skills, teachers and peers communicate with these students less often, decreasing the number of opportunities to engage.

We argue that environments and activities that privilege scientific inductive reasoning increase possibilities for emerging bilingual students to engage. This study investigated first-grade students' discussions about factors that affect how objects float. Students came from a variety of language backgrounds; all were considered beginner/intermediate ELLs. Results show that the goal of inducing principles from actual phenomena encouraged students to communicate their ideas and reasoning, boosting students' confidence in expressing themselves.

At the tertiary level, reasoning skills such as hypothesis generation and evidence evaluation are equally deemed as a central learning goal in introductory science courses. Presumably, as students learn more content-oriented domain knowledge, their reasoning skills are expected to increase correspondingly. Prior cognitive and educational research has also predominantly supported this view of mutually corroborative relationship between content learning and reasoning skills. Drawing on this basis, this paper empirically investigates the influence of content learning on the development of college students scientific reasoning skills. Students from four grade levels (grades 13-16), representing individuals exposed to different amount of content learning, took the Lawsons Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning (LCTSR).

5184,Contributed Poster Presentation,Rethinking the Locus of Evaluation to Promote Classroom Scientific Induction,"For over a century, physicists and physics educators have attempted to transform physics education to engage students in scientific induction. These efforts have largely failed to bring about evidence-based, inductive reasoning on a broad scale. This study investigates the role of nontraditional evaluative structures in promoting authentic scientific reasoning among students, as contrasted with more commonly observed failure-avoidance behaviors, in two physics classes. Prominent evaluative structures in this context consisted of (1) individual and small group reconciliation of students ideas and explanations with available laboratory evidence and (2) whole class consensus building of explanations that can best explain the evidence collected. Findings suggest that the relocation of evaluative authority of students ideas and explanations to laboratory evidence and social consensus, rather than with teacher and text, can promote more authentic engagement, enjoyment, and a sense of identification with physics.",Mike Ross,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5184,University of Colorado at Boulder,,2013

Results indicate that within this learning context, female students from linguistically diverse backgrounds demonstrate comparable performance on post-course assessments of conceptual understanding and the use of models and evidence.  However, we did not observe the same results from male students from linguistically diverse backgrounds.

5230,Contributed Poster Presentation,Self-Efficacy Development and In-the-Moment Experiences,"Self-efficacy, the belief in ones ability to succeed in the task at hand, has been reported to support students in overcoming challenges inherent in learning physics. Traditionally self efficacy is measured by pre-post course surveys.  However, these measures do not reveal how efficacy is experienced in the course and provide little detail informing the causes of shifts in self-efficacy. In-the-moment data on student affective experience, including self-efficacy,  was collected to complement pre-post surveys. Students in an introductory calculus based physics course had increases in self-efficacy (d = 0.5, p < 0.01) as measured by pre-post surveys. Yet, in-the-moment measures indicated that students had lower experiences of self-efficacy in this physics course than in all other STEM courses. These results imply that investigating how students reflect on their physics learning experiences is necessary for understanding how to improve students physics self-efficacy.",Jayson Nissen,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5230,University of Maine,,2013
5305,Contributed Poster Presentation,Similar Density Questions with Very Different Results,"While developing a standardized fluids assessment covering buoyancy and pressure, we discovered deficiencies in student understanding of density.  In particular, many college students do not recognize that density is a fixed property of a solid substance, such as aluminum or gold.  We added questions to our diagnostic exam to probe the extent of student difficulties.  In one of our questions, only 50-60% of students recognize that the density of gold is a fixed value.  When similar questions from an existing diagnostic1 are used, however, 85-90% of students correctly identify the density of a piece of wood and of a diamond as fixed values.  In this paper we discuss the differences between these questions and how those differences affect student responses.

5214,Contributed Poster Presentation,Student Difficulties with the Car and Passenger Problem,"Students were asked to draw all the forces on both an accelerating car and on a passenger riding in that car. Then they were asked to identify why the car accelerated. As it turns out, these are hard questions. Students cannot always think of the correct forces. In those cases, if they are motivated to make Newton's second law work, they might invent forces, or label things as forces that are not actually forces (i.e. ""motion,"" ""momentum,"" ""inertia""). In other cases, the labeled forces are all interactions between two objects, but students cannot then use Newton's second law do explain why things accelerate. This presentation will examine the conditions under which students make these choices. In addition, student performance on the Force Concept Inventory, particularly the items about the nature of forces and about Newtons Second law, relates to their performance on the free-response problem in an intriguing way.",Jennifer Blue,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5214,Miami University,,2013
5185,Contributed Poster Presentation,Student Epistemology About Mathematical Integration In A Physics Context: A Case Study,"During a sequence of interventions including a tutorial and a teaching interview, a student (Bryce) showed evidence of understanding all the steps of Riemann-sum style reasoning about why displacement corresponds to the area under a velocity vs. time graph, which in turn corresponds to the integral of velocity over time.  However, he does not view this reasoning as productive for explaining to someone why displacement corresponds to that area under the velocity vs. time curve. We argue that his view stems not primarily from conceptual or mathematical difficulties but from his epistemological stance toward learning integration. Although Bryce tries to mesh physical/conceptual reasoning and other pieces of mathematical formalism (such as simple equations), he views integration as something to be accepted and used.  He therefore frames the Riemann sum reasoning as unneeded logical stepping stones rather than as a deeper explanation linking mathematical formalism to intuitive physical ideas.",Joshua Von Korff,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5185,Georgia State University,"Andrew Elby, Department of Teaching & Learning, Policy & Leadership, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742

Results from interviews and questions administered in sophomore and upper-division courses indicate that traditional instruction on blackbody radiation often does not help students apply the concepts and mathematical formalism to real-world objects.  We are developing an online homework that approaches blackbody radiation from a phenomenological viewpoint, rather than from an idealized formalism.  Initial use suggests that this homework helps students understand, for example, how the spectrum of an incandescent light bulb changes with temperature.  Moreover, students who have worked through the homework also seem able to provide more robust answers during interviews than students who have not.  However, we find that students continue to struggle with the concept of blackbody radiation.

A small but persistent difference in student ability to read trends in graphs with only two data points in comparison to graphs with five data points has been found. In addition, large differences have been found in student ability to use graphs showing that the variables have no relation, a horizontal line, or an unknown relationship, a vertical line, vs. more standard graphs where the data is showing either a proportional or an inverse relationship. Lastly, there seems to be small differences in student ability to predict hypothetical values of data outside a graphed region compared to their ability to analyze the trend (proportional, inverse, none, or unknown).",Rebecca Rosenblatt,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5253,Illinois State Univeristy,,2013

Students struggle further when asked to break down a vector in an inclined coordinate system, such as the weight vector of a box on an inclined plane. Varying the placement of the angle consistently affects student error and response patterns across four physics student populations: algebra-based mechanics, algebra-based E&M, calculus-based mechanics, and calculus-based E&M. This suggests that student difficulties with trigonometric vector components are persistent and pervasive, even across different introductory physics courses, and are far below the requisite near-perfect accuracy needed for such fundamental skills.

One reason for emphasizing algebra is the high dimensionality of quantum mathematical systems; even spin-1/2 systems require a 2-d complex number space for describing their quantum states, which can be hard to visualize. Using nested phasor diagrams, which use nesting to increase the dimensionality of graphic space, we taught undergraduate students to represent spin-1/2 states graphically as well as algebraically. In oral exams, students were asked to identify which spin-1/2 states, expressed numerically, would generate the same set of probabilities as each other (i.e., they are the same except for a different overall phase factor). Video records of oral exams show that no students (N=13) performed this task successfully using an algebraic method; instead, all students solved the problem graphically.

5242,Contributed Poster Presentation,The Partial Derivative Machine,"Research has shown that students struggle to understand the use of partial derivatives in thermodynamics. We have designed an apparatus, which we have called a Partial Derivative Machine, that serves as a mechanical analogue of a thermodynamic system. Using this device, students have a tangible way to wrestle with issues related to partial derivatives and thermodynamics, such as which variables are held fixed, how many variables are independent, and how energy can be added to a system. In this paper, we present a description of the apparatus, an introduction to the associated activities, and an overview of how this apparatus can be connected to thermodynamic systems.

Texas Instruments designed a calculator which is able to use probes and collect data. This work presents results of the implementation of two electric circuits RTP activities using calculators in a laboratory. The sample was a total of 200 students from a private Mexican University. Half of the students used RTP with calculators and the other half used Tutorials from the University of Washington since the Institution had used Tutorials for some time. We assessed the implementation with a multiple choice test at the end of each activity and the CSEM (pre/post) with 12 additional questions taken from the Electric Circuits Concept Evaluation but modified to fit the format of the CSEM. Results indicate that RTP with calculators had similar learning results compared to Tutorials but some differences in the potential difference concept.,Genaro Zavala,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5300,Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Monica Quezada-Espinoza

We analyze student-tracking logs generated by the LON-CAPA learning management system from nearly a decade of both blended on-campus lecture and distance off-campus introductory physics courses at Michigan State University, as well as on-campus and open-online courses from MIT.  Data mining provides estimates of the overall amount and temporal regularity of etext use, i.e., weekly reading versus review immediately before exams. For all courses studied, we compare student use of etexts as it varies with course structure, e.g., from traditional (three or four exams, etext assigned as supplementary) to reformed (frequent exams, embedded assessment in the assigned etext). Traditional format courses are accompanied by little etext use, while high reading levels persist throughout reformed courses.",Daniel T.

However, previous studies have shown that this sort of teaching is relatively rare in American classrooms and, when present, often fleeting in nature.  In this poster, I offer a look inside two classroom episodes in which teachers altered their plans in response to unexpected ideas from students and continued to attend and respond to student thinking for extended periods of time, with an eye toward what might initiate and sustain the teachers in doing so.

Our findings suggest that inserting life science context into the content of the courses influenced students differentially based on their level of preexisting interest in physics.Taken together with results from the CLASS survey, these findings suggest that certain types of life science contexts in introductory physics can support students whose initial interest in physics is less developed  to deepen their interest; however, not all contexts are equally effective.",Catherine H.

Our study analyzes students interactions as they work together in groups, engaging in experimental design and how their interactions are related to their problem-solving performance in exams. Students are first given an experimental design problem. They must solve the design problem and learn new physics by working together in groups of three and collaborating together as a whole class. A day later they take an individual exam in which one of the problems is related to the experimental design problem they encountered previously. Using video data, we identify different ways in which students participate in group discussions when they engage in the experimental design problem.

Yet very little attention has been paid by physics education researchers to these Aha! moments, perhaps because of their elusive nature.  Using video analysis of an introductory physics tutorial on Newtons 3rd law, this preliminary study explores several open questions: How do we identify students Aha! moments in the classroom?  What can instructors and curriculum designers do to set the stage for these moments?  How do students respond to these experiences?  Video analysis reveals that by using common affective displays and discourse markers, all three groups signal their experience of an Aha! moment in response to the same tutorial question.  The groups vary in the extent to which these experiences are shared, as well as in the intensity and valence of their emotional responses to their sudden insight.",Luke Conlin,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5298,"Graduate School of Education, Stanford University",,2013

We surveyed n=35 introductory physics students about their sense-making activities while solving physics problems. The survey included items from the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS). We then conducted focus group interviews and problem-solving interviews with a subset of these students in order to identify the students sense-making activities as they occurred.

Specifically, we are adapting the Pedagogical Expectancy Violation Assessment (PEVA) for use in conjunction with measures of satisfaction and class performance. For this pilot study, we present results from a preliminary version of the instrument, given in studio physics courses at Eastern Kentucky University and the University of Central Florida, along with a discussion of current validation and refinement efforts.

However, we often treat valuing as a binary construct: one either values student ideas, or one does not. In this paper, I define and distinguish between three ways of valuing student ideas: moral, instrumental, and intellectual. I demonstrate that novice teachers in the Seattle Pacific University (SPU) Learning Assistant (LA) Program instantiate all three ways of valuing student ideas and that they shift from primarily valuing ideas morally and instrumentally toward valuing ideas in all three ways. That this shift co-occurred with increased attention to student ideas suggests that intellectually valuing these ideas may support and sustain teacher attention to student thinking, and vice versa.",Amy D.

These students were in a seminar for physics majors that engaged students in problem solving in small group and in whole-class discussions, and that encouraged them to form study groups outside of class for their other courses.  Though many students reported studying in groups, I found wide variation in the goals, structures, and activities of their study groups.

As such, we can build on efforts over the last couple of decades to further expand the goals of physics teaching and learning beyond the historic measures of content mastery.  We are now poised to examine how social and psychological domains impact and are impacted by the traditional content we so dearly love.  Drawing from a theoretical tradition that takes play seriously, I explore a few environments where play and 'messing about' simultaneously develop student affect and content mastery. At CU we are involved in: research documenting the engagement of youth in science to promote identity and content mastery; studies linking psychological effects to student performance and retention in college physics; and, investigations of the impacts of advanced undergraduate and graduate experiences that encourage productive messing about as scientists.

This case-study draws on video-taped interactions of a small group of students working on a physics tutorial. The analysis of the conceptual and epistemological substance of students' talk and the associated emotions draws on a combination of methodologies from knowledge analysis, interaction analysis, and conversation analysis traditions.

One communicative approach involves the use of narratives, by which we mean documents that tell the stories of interesting incidents that occurred during class.  A narrative presents what the students and instructor said and did, with commentary based upon insights articulated by the instructor and perhaps colleagues while watching a video or listening to an audio recording of the interaction (see example narratives from the Paradigms Program at <a href=""http://physics.oregonstate.edu/portfolioswiki/start"">http://physics.oregonstate.edu/portfolioswiki/start</a>).

5236,Roundtable Discussion,Relation of scientific reasoning to solving different physics problem types,"In recent years researchers have compared scientific reasoning abilities of students in introductory physics courses with conceptual learning.  This research suggests students with more formal reasoning patterns are more proficient learners.  However, little has been done to investigate how scientific reasoning abilities relate to ability to solve different types of problems, including those based on the application of simple algorithms and those which depend on conceptual understanding.  In this pilot study we compared student scientific reasoning abilities, as measured by Lawsons Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning, to student ability to correctly solve both problem types on midterm and final examinations.  Results indicate that students with higher reasoning abilities perform equally well on both problem types while students of lower reasoning abilities struggle in solving problems that depend on conceptual understanding.  This suggests that students with lower reasoning abilities may depend more readily on memorization of simple procedures to solve problems.",Carol Fabby,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5236,University of Cincinnati,"Kathleen Koenig, University of Cincinnati",2013

1.  Visual Beauty of Physics. Can appreciation of the beauty of physics (e.g. sunsets or fractals) be increased by deeper understanding of the physics, or does it spoil the fun?
2.  Aesthetics of Science Practice. What aesthetics might either drive or prevent the transformation from observer to practitioner? What are the aesthetic qualities that might entice students or teachers to claim identity as scientists, even physicists? 
3.  Cultural Aspects of Physics Aesthetics. The contrast of a Western reductionist approach with a holistic Eastern thought approach can be cast as a difference in aesthetic. How does ones cultural perspective influence aesthetic responses to physics?",Jean Hertzberg,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5210,"University of Colorado, Boulder","Dewey Dykstra, Boise State University

5337,Symposium Poster,Challenges in developing effective scaffolding supports to help introductory students learn physics,"Helping students develop facility with problem representation is a major goal of many introductory physics courses. We discuss two studies related to representations in which we investigated strategies for improving students' performance on problem solving. In one study, we investigated students' difficulties in translating between mathematical and graphical representations and the effect of scaffolding on students' performance. Analysis of the student performance with different levels of scaffolding reveals that the appropriate level of scaffolding is not necessarily the one that involves lots of guidance and support from an expert's perspective and that the optimal level of support for a given student population can only be determined by research. In another study, we investigated whether students perform better when a diagram is provided with the problem or when they are explicitly asked to draw a diagram. We find that students who draw a good diagram perform better regardless of whether they use a diagrammatic approach to problem solving or mainly use a mathematical approach to problem solving. Instructional implications will be discussed.",Alex Maries,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5337,University of Pittsburgh,"Chandralekha Singh, University of Pittsburgh",2013
5328,Symposium Poster,Exploring the affective domain in teaching intermediate mechanics:  Benefits and challenges arising from a tutorial approach,"Intermediate mechanics is often the first undergraduate theory course that physics majors and minors take beyond the introductory level.  Unless their introductory courses were substantially reformed by PER-tested teaching and learning strategies, physics students may very likely hold unproductive attitudes, expectations, and habits of mind that have been reinforced from their experiences in introductory physics.  Such beliefs and attitudes will not only contribute to challenges they will face in their advanced courses but how they will try to respond to those challenges.  This targeted poster is designed to spark discussion about how recent PER and curriculum development efforts can help address such affective issues in the context of a reformed intermediate mechanics course.  Examples of teaching and assessment strategies developed in the context of the Intermediate Mechanics Tutorials (IMT) project will be presented. [1]  Examples will include those shared by pilot-site implementers of IMT materials.  Emphasized in particular will be the benefits and challenges of resources like IMT that incorporate guided inquiry but that are meant to supplement--not replace--a lecture-based approach.

5330,Symposium Poster,Improving students' understanding of quantum mechanics,"Learning quantum mechanics is challenging, in part due to the abstract nature of the subject. We have been conducting investigations of the difficulties that students have in learning quantum mechanics. To help improve student understanding of quantum concepts, we are developing quantum interactive learning tutorials (QuILTs) as well as tools for peer-instruction. The goal of QuILTs and peer-instruction tools is to actively engage students in the learning process and to help them build links between the formalism and the conceptual aspects of quantum physics without compromising the technical content. They focus on helping students integrate qualitative and quantitative understanding, and discriminate between concepts that are often confused. We will discuss examples of materials and assessment.

5321,Symposium Poster,Learning Assistants' Development of Physics (Teacher) Identity,"The physics department at Texas State University-San Marcos is developing a Learning Assistant (LA) program with reform-based instructional changes in our introductory course sequences. We are interested in how participation in the LA program influences LAs' identity both as physics students and as physics teachers; in particular, how being part of the LA community changes participants' self-concepts and their day-to-day practice. We analyze both written artifacts and video data; our analysis of self-concepts is informed by the identity framework developed by Hazari et al. [1] and our analysis of practice is informed by Lave and Wenger's theory of Communities of Practice [2, 3]. Preliminary experience suggests that engagement in the collaborative physics education community elements of the LA program blurs the distinction between learner and teacher practice and increases LAs' engagement in negotiation of meaning in both contexts.

5323,Symposium Poster,Multiple pathways to the development of a physics identity,"In an ongoing investigation into identity development in upper-level physics students we present three case studies illustrating the relationship between identity development and a students pathway through physics. Sally is a physics minor who gradually transforms into a physicist through her undergraduate research experiences and a developing affinity for physics as a discipline. Bob is a mechanical engineering and physics double major who attests a great affinity for physics but ends up dropping it as a major due to practical career concerns. Larry is a physics major who intends to be a teacher and repeatedly identifies himself a physicist. In this talk we talk about this group of students development in light of a framework which conceptualizes identity as having three integral aspects -- personal, practice, and participation -- by examining both interview and observational data. We conclude that discussions about physics identity development should not be reserved for physics majors.",Paul Irving,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5323,Kansas State University,"Eleanor Sayre, Kansas State University",2013
5170,Symposium Poster,Paradigms in Physics Education Research,"Physics education research (PER) includes three distinct paradigms: quantitative research, qualitative research, and question-driven research. Quantitative PER seeks reproducible, representative patterns and relationships; human behavior is seen as dictated by lawful (albeit probabilistic) relationships. Qualitative PER seeks to refine and develop theory by linking theory to cases; human action is seen as being shaped by the meanings that participants make of their local environments. Question-driven physics education researchers prioritize their research questions over the pursuit of local meanings or abstract relationships. As such, they privilege research methods that match their particular question at hand, rather than methods that attend to the rich details of a particular context or those that emphasize representativeness or reproducibility. We illustrate each paradigm with interviews with physics education researchers and examples of published PER.",Amy D.

5333,Symposium Poster,Problem Solving and Motivation  Getting our Students in Flow,"Csï¿½kszentmihï¿½lyi proposed the psychological concept of flow as signifying a state of complete involvement and enjoyment in an activity.  When learners are in flow they are motivated, engaged, and completely focused on the task at hand, resulting in effortful learning.  In this poster we explore the connections between the concept of flow and our model of transfer of learning as applied to problem solving.  Our model of transfer purports two cognitive mechanisms  horizontal and vertical  that learners use to construct knowledge.  Further, it proposes that carefully designed sequences of horizontal and vertical learning which provide scaffolding within a learner's zone of proximal development can facilitate learners to navigate an optimal adaptability corridor and foster progress toward adaptive expertise as characterized by Bransford & Schwartz.  By exploring the connections between flow and our model of transfer, we hope to gain insights into what can motivate learners to become better problem solvers.",N.

As part of this project, we have described research on student learning of a number of specific topics on which there is relatively little prior research, including elementary statistics and statistical physics (Loverude 2009), entropy and the approach to thermal equilibrium (Loverude 2012), heat engines (Smith 2009), and Boltzmann factors (Smith 2010).  A second key thread of this project has involved the underlying mathematics and its impact of student learning of physics (Wagner 2011, Wemyss 2011).  In this poster, we will take a broad look at the project as a whole, including research as well as curriculum development efforts, and summarize key findings.

5324,Symposium Poster,Students navigation between multiple physics identities,"Becoming a physicist involves learning to be part of multiple physics communities. In this enculturation process, students socially interact with these communities to develop physicist identities and understanding of what it means and takes to be a physicist. At the same time, students also mediate potential mismatches that can cause conflict between their physics communities and personal communities. In each of these communities, students develop identities that inform and are influenced by their participation and membership. However, because the students are physicist in multiple communities, we use the notion of a nexus of multi-membership to consider their collection of identities and how students navigate between them. In this study, we present case studies of five female students from underrepresented groups in physics in ethnicity or as first-generation college students. By examining the collection of identities, the impact of family and cultural conflicts on their identity development is highlighted.",Sissi L.

5332,Symposium Poster,Tangible Metaphors,"Upper-division physics requires students to use abstract mathematical objects to model measurable properties of physical entities.   We have developed activities that engage students in using their own bodies or simple home-built apparatus as metaphors for novel (to the students) types of mathematical objects.  These tangible metaphors are chosen to be rich, robust, and flexible so that students can explore several properties of the mathematical objects over an extended period of time.  The collaborative nature of the activities and inherent silliness of ""dancing""  out the behavior of currents or spinors certainly increases the fun in the classroom and may also decrease students' fear of learning about these mathematical objects.  We include examples from the electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics content in the Paradigms in Physics program at Oregon State University.

5335,Symposium Poster,Teaching problem categorization using computer-based feedback,"Categorization tasks are commonly used as a measure of problem solving expertise, but they might also be useful pedagogical tools for highlighting the concepts and principles needed to solve problems. In this study, introductory physics students viewed several pairs of problems on a computer screen and were asked to judge whether the problems would be solved similarly. We found that students who received elaborate principle-based feedback on their answer then increased their use of physics principles when explaining their choices, whereas students who did not receive detailed feedback continued to make decisions based on quantities and surface-level problem features. Additional study findings will be discussed and instructional implications will be proposed.",Jennifer Docktor,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5335,University of Wisconsin  La Crosse,"Jose Mestre, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

5322,Symposium Poster,The Development and Measurement of Identity across the Physical Sciences,"Drawing from earlier work of Gee (1999), Carlone (2004), and Shanahan (2009), we developed a framework for ""good physics student role identity"" or, more simply, ""physics identity"" which is a reliable proxy for students' affinity towards physics and is predictive of students' career choices. This framework was postulated to be comprised of performance beliefs, competence beliefs, recognition beliefs, and interest (Hazari et al, 2010).  Subsequent investigations showed that performance and competence beliefs are not distinct (Potvin et al, 2011; 2012) and the combined performance/competence construct is somewhat akin to Bandura's self-efficacy (Bandura, 1986).  Recent work has extended this framework to mathematics (Cribbs et al, 2012) and engineering (Godwin et al, 2013).  We conclude with a discussion of the future of the framework for understanding ""best practices"" in STEM classrooms.",Geoff Potvin,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5322,Clemson University,"Zahra Hazari, Clemson University",2013
5336,Symposium Poster,The role of representations in research-based instructional practice in physics,"Decades of physics education research and of research-based instructional practice have demonstrated convincingly the crucial role played by multiple representations in the learning of physics. Conceptual understanding is both reflected in and promoted by facility in the use of graphical, mathematical, diagrammatic, and verbal representations as well as in the ability to translate between and among different representations. Similarly, familiarity with topic-specific representations such as PV diagrams, free-body diagrams, motion graphs, and field-vector and potential-line diagrams is virtually indispensable for thorough understanding of particular concepts. I will review examples of research that illustrate some of the learning issues that arise with use of multiple representations, and will present examples of instructional strategies that have proved effective in guiding students to deeper understanding through use of representations in different contexts.

5334,Symposium Poster,Using categorization task to improve expertise in introductory physics,"The ability to categorize problems based upon underlying principles, rather than surface features or contexts, is considered one of several proxy predictors of expertise. Giving students categorization task and then discussing experts' ways of categorizing problems can be used to help students develop expertise in physics and help them focus on deep features of problems. Inspired by the classic study of Chi, Feltovich, and Glaser [1], we revisited categorization study in large introductory physics classes.  Some problems in the categorization task posed to students included those available from the prior study by Chi et al. Our findings, which contrast from those of Chi et al., suggest that there is a much wider distribution of expertise in mechanics among introductory students than previously believed.  Implications for pedagogical interventions will be discussed.

I will compare these students to data about who takes introductory physics courses, and what courses they take.  In general, the students we study are taking more advanced classes and are better prepared than the overall introductory course population.

In this study I examine student motivations toward physics and the role of tools in reorganizing social practices in the classroom environment and culturespecifically iPads acting as boundary objects, bridging the cultural practices of students peers, the physics classroom, and the physics community. The act of creating screencasts arises as a central example of how the iPad can be used to generate and share physics knowledge, while allowing students to incorporate references that are meaningful in their peer cultures.

Additionally, digital notebooks are more aligned with the way digital natives have learned to do their work.  Initial results suggest that digital lab notebooks lead to increased student achievement, engagement, and quality of work.  Survey results revealed that students preferred digital notebooks because they allow for easier data sharing and increased versatility.  These results will be discussed along with implications for instruction and further research.",Angela Cannava,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5137,"University of Colorado, Boulder",,2013
5344,Symposium Talk,Changing the Locus of Evaluation to Promote Scientific Induction,"This study investigates the impact of nontraditional evaluative structures in the physics classroom on student affect. Typically, physics students' answers in discussions and on exams are evaluated by the instructor as right or wrong. In the learning environment that was the subject of this study, students were expected to reconcile their own ideas with available laboratory evidence and reach consensus with their peers. The overwhelming majority of the 15 students interviewed expressed positive attitudes towards learning physics and positive identification with physics. Video analysis suggests that this nontraditional evaluative practice resulted in authentic scientific reasoning, persistence, and enjoyment among students as they engaged in scientific induction. These findings suggest that the relocation of evaluative authority of students' ideas and explanations to laboratory evidence and social consensus, rather than with teacher and text, can promote more authentic engagement, enjoyment, and a sense of identification with physics.",Michael J.

The first treatment involved flexible, supportive classroom structures that theoretically would lead to a greater homework completion rate. The second treatment (or control) involved the traditional, authoritative structures that had been in placestudents were penalized for not completing homework within the designated timeframe.  Initial results suggest that the flexible supportive structures led to greater homework completion rates and to higher performances on the district assessment over the non-flexible homework condition.

5342,Symposium Talk,Improving Student Success through Spatial Skills Intervention,"Dr. Sheryl Sorby has been conducting research in the area of engineering education and her primary focus of research is on improving the 3-D spatial visualization skills of engineering students. The ability to visualize in three dimensions is a cognitive skill that has been shown to be important for success in engineering and other technological fields. For engineering, the ability to mentally rotate 3-D objects is especially important. Unfortunately, of all the cognitive skills, 3-D rotation abilities exhibit robust gender differences, favoring males. The assessment of 3-D spatial skills and associated gender differences has been a topic of educational research for nearly a century; however, a great deal of the previous work has been aimed at merely identifying differences. Dr. Sorby has been conducting research aimed at identifying practical methods for improving 3-D spatial skills, especially for women engineering students.

Due to limited language skills, teachers and peers communicate with these students less often, decreasing the number of opportunities to engage. Exclusion can be avoided with learning activities that invite all students to participate and contribute their thinking. We argue that environments and activities that privilege scientific inductive reasoning increase possibilities for emerging bilingual students to engage. This study investigated third-grade students' discussions about factors that affect how objects make sound. Students came from a variety of language backgrounds; all were considered beginner/intermediate ELLs. Results show that the goal of inducing principles from actual phenomena encouraged students to communicate their ideas and reasoning, boosting students' confidence in expressing themselves. Following the hybrid space argument of Vygotsky's theory of concept formation, we see how external expression could lead to internalization of science concepts, and to develop English language skills.",Enrique Suarez,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5345,University of Colorado-Boulder,,2013

Studies in engineering, conducted by Sheryl Sorby and colleagues, have shown significant gains in retention of students, as well as gains in GPA, by providing instruction to improve spatial skills of incoming undergraduate students.  Physics, on the other hand, has focused on targeted areas of correlation instead of courses as a whole.  For example, studies have shown that there are correlations between projectile motion and spatial/visualization skills, but there have not been a lot of studies focused on the entire courses.

5166,Talk Symposium,Stop calling me stupid: Failure avoidance versus empowerment in physics learning,"Research presented by panel participants explores the hypothesis that high school physics classrooms often promote fear of failure rather than the spirit and excitement of scientific investigation.  How do teachers of physics create environments that invite students to engage openly in communal efforts to make sense of the natural world rather than causing students to retreat due to internal fears of failure?  Data will be presented that begin to extract particular strategies for promoting empowerment and agency rather than fear and alienation. We begin to outline the characteristics of classroom environments can leverage the natural curiosity of students so that the very process of scientific inquiry can serve as the mechanism through which agency and empowerment is achieved. This, we claim, is the missing link in building what could be a very strong connection between the students intellectual, inquisitive, and social selves and the playful, social, and systematic world of science.",Ben Van Dusen,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5166,CU Boulder,,2013
