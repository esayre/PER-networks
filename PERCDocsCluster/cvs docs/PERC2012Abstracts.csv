4669,Contributed Poster Presentation,A Comparison of Two Instructional Models Using Contrasting Cases,"Inventing a general explanation for contrasting cases is an effective learning strategy (Schwartz, Chase, Oppezzo, & Chin, 2011).  Inventing activities implicitly ask students to compare and contrast cases.  Is compare and contrast alone enough?  Over 4 class periods, 6th grade students learned about horizontal projectile motion through Compare and Contrast (CC) instruction or Invention (INV) activities using identical contrasting cases generated by a Physics Education Technology (PhET) computer simulation. Results showed that the INV treatment led to superior learning outcomes over the CC condition.  Worksheet analyses revealed that CC students mainly focused on single factor features, whereas the inventing directive led students to focus on finding an overall explanation. As a result, the INV students were more likely to give deeper structure accounts of the features that could explain all the contrasting cases.  Comparing and contrasting is necessary for induction but not sufficient for finding deep structure in physics.",Nicole R.

4581,Contributed Poster Presentation,A Cross-grade Comparison of Student Views about Learning Physics,"Students views about physics and learning of physics exert a great influence on the way they study this subject matter. Those who perceive physics as a coherent scientific enterprise consisting of interconnected knowledge resources are likely to approach physics differently than those who view it as a laundry list of disconnected bits-and-pieces of facts or formulas. Although many physics classes are intended to cultivate student scientific learning attitudes, prior research has shown that typical instruction often resulted in a lesser alignment of students views about physics with those of experts. Much work along this line has been carried out in the US, and only a few studies were aimed at international students. We report here a cross-grade study of Chinese students views about physics and learning of physics using the Colorado Learning Attitudes Survey about Science. Results that reveal the trend of change in student learning attitudes are reported.",Lin Ding,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4581,"School of Teaching and Learning, The Ohio State University",,2012

This has been termed the Big-Fish-Little-Pond Effect"".  We have examined CLASS data from the mainstream introductory physics course at MIT and found evidence of an analogous decline in confidence about physics problem solving ability, even among students receiving an A or B in the course.  This decline is apparently correlated with a student's subsequent selection of major.  Students who eventually select a major closely related to physics do not (on average) exhibit a significant decline in self-confidence during the freshman course, regardless of gender.  Students whose major has no close relationship to physics do (on average) exhibit a significant decline in confidence regardless of gender.  Students whose major is intermediate display a gender-dependent evolution of confidence, with only female students (on average) exhibiting a significant decline.",Andrew Pawl,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4515,University of Wisconsin-Platteville,"David E.

Although theyve had extensive experience with friction in the context of energy, this is their first exposure to friction within the context of forces.

They are asked to make different representations for this scenario, including a system schema, and force diagram.  During their small group work, students quickly run into a difficulty:  there are only two interactions with the box (contact, gravitational), so there should only be two forces, yet the box is slowing, which means it must have unbalanced forces in the direction of acceleration.

In this poster, I present evidence from the student-lead whole class discussion showing how the class uses the System Schema to help reason about this problem in a productive manner and come to a useful consensus.",Brant Hinrichs,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4568,Drury University,,2012
4433,Contributed Poster Presentation,A conceptual physics class where students found meaning in calculations,"Prior to taking a translated version of Open Source Tutorials [1] (OSTs) as a stand-alone course, most students at Tokyo Gakugei University had experienced physics as memorizing laws and equations to use as computational tools.   We might expect students entering this reformed physics class, which emphasizes common sense and conceptual reasoning and rarely invokes equations, to produce students who see a disconnect between equation use and intuitive/conceptual reasoning.  Many students at Gakugei, however, somehow learned to reconcile quantitative problem solving with conceptual understanding even though OSTs do not emphasize this process.    Tadao, for example, came to see that although a common-sense solution to a problem is preferable for explaining to someone who doesnt know physics, solving the problem with a quantitative calculation (that connects to physical meaning) can bring clarity and concreteness to communication between experts.   How this reconciliation occurred remains an open question and a candidate for future research.

While our previous studies on student epistemology went some way towards understanding student performance it became clear that broader socio-cultural and systemic issues were playing critical roles. Using Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) as a theoretical perspective we (a) characterized the broader context as an Activity System and (b) identified the four main levels of systemic contradictions as proposed by the theory. We present findings from studies involving various cohorts of students.  One of the components of the curriculum that presented particular difficulty was an intermediate level Electromagnetism course. We therefore analysed this as a subsystem identifying several systemic and historical tensions.,Victoria Nwosu,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4623,"Department of Physics, University of Cape Town","Saalih Allie, Department of Physics, University of Cape Town, South Africa

Over the last two years, we have implemented PhET computer simulations in middle school (MS) classrooms and found that open play can allow increased student agency and simultaneously lower barriers for student-centered pedagogy. In these MS classes, activities begin with 5 minutes of open play where students use simulations without instruction. A moderately-guided, inquiry-based activity follows. In focus groups, MS students articulate that they value the play time because it is fun and because it allows them to become familiar with the simulation. These students simultaneously express that the written activities are important for learning specific content. In a study of classes with play versus no-play, we found that with play, the teacher focused on student ideas and science content, while without play the teacher employed more direct instruction.",Noah Podolefsky,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4628,University of Colorado,"Danny Rehn, Katherine K.

Thus, while TAs may still be in the process of developing their views on teaching physics, their practices directly influence a large number of introductory students. As the first steps reforming our introductory courses and TA training program, we collected multiple types of data on TAs teaching in traditional algebra-based physics laboratories. Recently, the beliefs, practices and training of TAs have drawn the attention of several researchers. Drawing on prior work on TAs pedagogical knowledge, we explore how the beliefs expressed by TAs in interviews align with their practices during a laboratory video-taped mid-semester.

In this talk we present evidence that the difficulty students face in trying to reconcile each other's ideas can be understood through a positional identity lens.

4651,Contributed Poster Presentation,Arrows as Anchors: Conceptual Blending and Student Use of Electric Field Vector Arrows,"We use the theory of conceptual blending with material anchors to describe how people make meaning of the vector arrows representation of electric fields. We describe this representation as a conceptual blend of a spatial (coordinate) input space and an electric-field-as-arrows space (which itself is a blend of electric field concept with arrows).  This representation possesses material features including the use of spatial extent (e.g., distance on paper) to represent the coordinate space and to represent the magnitude of electric field vectors. As a result, this representation supports a geometric interpretation of the electric field, breaking the field into components, and the addition of two fields at a point. The material features also emphasize the spatial relationships between the source(s) and points where the field is represented. However, the material features also necessitate sampling and do not generally support the rapid superposition of two fields at all points. We illustrate this analysis with examples from clinical problem-solving interviews with upper-division physics majors, and interpret students' errors in using this representation as resulting from conflict between the input spaces in the blend.",Elizabeth Gire,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4651,University of Memphis,"Edward Price, California State University San Marcos",2012

We report on a study that explores students responses to a KS in introductory physics and chemistry courses serving both STEM and non-STEM populations. In many courses, Delta (the difference between KS-score and Final Exam score, a measure of calibration) was anti-correlated with Final Exam performance.

We examined whether novice physics instructors can develop such knowledge via the activities of attending to student work and have identified several mechanisms that supported instructors in building this knowledge. We analyzed data from interviews with physics graduate teaching assistants as they examined and discussed students' written work.

4664,Contributed Poster Presentation,Changing Classroom Designs: Easy; Changing Instructors Pedagogies: Not So Easy&,"Technology-rich student-centered classrooms such as SCALE-UP and TEAL are designed  to actively engage students. We examine what happens when instructors adopt the classroom but not the pedagogy that goes with it. We measure the effect of using socio-technological spaces on students conceptual change and compare learning gains made in groups using different pedagogies (active learning vs. conventional instruction). We also interviewed 34 students to gauge their perceptions of the redesigned spaces as a function of the pedagogy they were exposed to.  Last, we correlate instructors self-reported instructional approach (teacher-centered vs student-centered) with the average normalized gains of their classes. Our findings suggest that technology-rich spaces are only effective when implemented with active pedagogies. Without active pedagogy, the technology-rich environment is not significantly different from conventional teacher-centered classrooms. We also find that students in socio-technological spaces differ in epistemic beliefs depending on the pedagogy they were exposed to. Students exposed to student-centered Active Learning had more expert-like epistemic beliefs than students exposed to teacher-centered approaches. We also find that instructors self-reported perception of student-centeredness accounts for a large fraction of the variance (R<sup>2</sup>=0.83) in their class average normalized gain. Instructors that adopted sociotechnological classrooms acknowledged the importance of student-centeredness. Though the classroom spaces were relatively easy to change, teachers pedagogies were not so easy to change.

Despite the apparent similarity in coverage, individual courses in each discipline have distinct emphases and applications.  Physics education researchers have identified student difficulties with concepts such as heat, temperature, and entropy as well as with larger grain-sized ideas such as state variables, path-dependent processes, etc.  Engineering education research has corroborated these findings and has identified additional difficulties unique to engineering contexts.  We are beginning a project that provides an excellent opportunity for expanding the interdisciplinary research on conceptual understanding in thermodynamics.  This project has two goals: first, determine the overlapping content and concepts across the disciplines; second, compare conceptual understanding between these groups using existing conceptual questions from PER and EER.  We will present a review of PER and EER literature in thermodynamics and highlight some concepts that we will investigate.

Four problem solving tasks related to electricity and magnetism were designed. Initially all students attempted a pre-test problem. Then a solution to a different problem based on the same concept was shown to half of students as an animation and to the other half as a written solution. Finally, all students solved a post-test problem. Results indicate that on three out of four tasks, there was a statistically significant improvement in problem solving skills after watching both animation and written solutions.

4600,Contributed Poster Presentation,Computational Modeling as a Promoter of Cognitive Transfer: Pilot Study,"We describe a study of the role of computational modeling in recognizing underlying similarities in different problems, a process called cognitive transfer. Previous studies have shown that this crucial process is highly sensitive to context, suggestion, and familiarity with the subject matter. We propose that courses emphasizing computational modeling, in which students repeatedly employ similar lines of code to model different physical systems, foster a more generalized cognitive transfer ability. We performed a think-aloud study on several students (some from a course involving computational modeling, others from a traditional physics course), exposing them to ordered pairs of problems of varying degrees of separation in specific details (molecular mechanics vs. projectile motion) and solution methods (numerical vs. analytical). With these data, we attempt to separate the influence of long-term instruction in computational modeling from the immediate priming effect of solving computational problems, and relate both to the promotion of cognitive transfer.",Scott S Douglas,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4600,Georgia Institute of Technology,"Marcos D Caballero

While existing research on programming comprehension explores how novices and experts generate programming algorithms, little of this discusses how domain content knowledge can influence students' programming practices. ""Epistemic games,"" which are coherent sequences of actions that are enacted to fulfill a particular set of expectations, explicitly link students' practices with their knowledge base. While these have generally been limited to describing analytic problem solving practices, they can also provide a means for addressing the interaction between content knowledge and programming practices. I will present a set of epistemic games which can be used, along with Resource Theory and framing, to describe novice students' computational modeling practices.",Brandon Lunk,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4889,NCSU,,2012
4654,Contributed Poster Presentation,Conceptual Blending in Physics Problem Solving,"Conceptual Blending (Fauconnier & Turner, 2002) is a cognitive theory in which thinkers blend together new and old ideas to create conceptual networks capable of yielding new insights. The structure of these networks is heavily influenced by the frames and relative importance the thinker assigns to the different ideas being blended together. In this poster, we analyze examples of student problem solving and case reuse in introductory physics classes (Mateycik, 2009; Ward & Sweller, 1990) from the perspective of Conceptual Blending. We propose possible conceptual networks for different problem solving tasks and compare the structure and complexity of these networks.

We are developing a conceptual model of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics as they relate to energy, with the goal of creating models and representations that link energy and entropy in a meaningful way for learners analyzing real-life energy scenarios. We expect this model to help learners better understand how their everyday experiences relate to formal physics analyses.

4566,Contributed Poster Presentation,Considering factors beyond transfer of knowledge across disciplines,"One thread in education research has been to investigate whether and in what ways students transfer their knowledge and use of particular concepts across disciplinary contexts . Such studies typically focus on the content of students knowledge.  For example, some studies investigate whether students who apply some knowledge in problem solving in a mathematical context can transfer that knowledge to solving a similarly structured physics problem.  We argue that in order to understand students reasoning across disciplinary contexts, we need to attend not just to their content knowledge, but also to their views on knowledge and learning (or epistemologies) in the disciplines.  We present the case of Will, a student working with two Taylor series approximation problems that were chosen to cue experiences from either math or physics. We aim to show that focusing on Wills epistemology aids our understanding of why he might reason differently across the two contexts.",Eric Kuo,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4566,"University of Maryland, College Park","Danielle Champney, University of California, Berkeley

This work presents the results of students responses to two sequences of superposition principle isomorphic questions in which the only difference was that in one of the sequences, the electric force was used and on the other sequence, the electric field. We administered one of the sequences to 249 students at a large private Mexican university after covering electrostatics in an Electricity and Magnetism class. Answers, reasoning and drawings were analyzed.

4574,Contributed Poster Presentation,Coupling Identity and Epistemology to Explain Differences in Learning Experiences,"Students' personal epistemology  their notions about the nature of knowledge and learning  affect how they approach learning. These personal epistemologies have usually been conceptualized as originating in students past experiences and recruited in particular learning contexts. Drawing on a case study based on a clinical interview with an electrical engineering major (""Rebecca"") in an introductory physics class, we argue that in some instances, students' projected sense of their future profession - an aspect of their developing disciplinary identities - influences their approaches towards learning. Specifically, Rebecca positions herself as an electrical engineer and draws a distinction between her introductory mechanics course, which she sees as irrelevant to her future, and courses on digital logic and introductory electromagnetism, which she sees as relevant. She sees mechanics as less coherent than digital logic. She structures her learning in the two courses differently and reflects on how she draws on more rote-learning in physics, but deep sense making in digital logic design.",Ayush Gupta,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4574,"University of Maryland, College Park","Andrew Elby, University of Maryland, College Park.",2012

Here, we provide a case study of an eighth-grade student from Honduras, ""Estevan,"" who first caught our attention in class for his dogged pursuit of trying to figure out how seasons occur on Earth.  We draw on interview and classroom data to demonstrate that what engages Estevan lies at the intersection of epistemology and identity.  Specifically, his epistemological stance toward science as figuring things out for oneself taps into his personal love of challenges, and this love of challenges is tied strongly to his sense of self.  We make the case for conceptualizing personal epistemology as deeply intertwined with aspects of identity, at least for some students, and we draw the implications of this perspective for classroom practice.",Jennifer Richards,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4516,"University of Maryland, College Park","Luke Conlin, Tufts University

Heckler (2011) proposed a reason with a perceptual basis: plausible and salient eye catching features in a problem capture students attention.  Once students attend to these perceptually salient features, less salient albeit thematically relevant features are not considered and students answer the problem incorrectly based on the salient features.  To test this hypothesis we recorded eye movements of introductory physics students on fifteen conceptual problems with diagrams.  Each diagram contained areas consistent with documented novice-like answers and other areas consistent with the scientifically correct answer.  We manipulated the luminance contrast of the diagrams to produce three versions of each diagram, which differed by the area with the highest level of perceptual salience.

In this poster, we present analyses of blending from both the effortful and effortless perspectives on the same piece of data -- a student making sense of harmonic motion on a rotating platform -- and claims about why some blending is hard and other blending is easy.",Eleanor C Sayre,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4895,Kansas State University,"Hunter G Close, Texas State University

They have also begun to see use in upper-division physics courses where the audience is almost entirely physics majors.  In this presentation we examine the hypothesis that these substantially different populations will result in different levels of participation and engagement.  We have videotaped the audiences of two introductory physics courses and two junior-level physics courses (mechanics and E&M in both cases) during clicker questions and quantified the level of engagement in each.  Preliminary results suggest that upper-division majors-only courses exhibit more peer-to-peer interaction and overall engagement than introductory courses.",Patrick B.

The whole class developed these goals through the Cogenerative Mediation Process for Learning Environments (CMPLE), which was used to help all participants create an environment representative of their learning preferences. This poster highlights the pedagogical changes corresponding to the goal of showing all steps when explaining solutions on white boards, which we observed through classroom video and teacher interviews. Although the teacher previously had expectations that students show all of their steps, she hadnt always verbalized these expectations to her students, and the students tended to leave out steps while presenting their white boards.  Focusing on the CMPLE goals (based on student learning preferences) allowed her to address this issue in her teaching.

Students discussing physics use more than words and equations; gestures are also a meaningful element of their thinking. Data come from one-on-one interviews in which students were asked to gesture about the sign and direction of velocity, acceleration, and other quantities. Specific contexts are a ball toss in the presence and absence of air resistance, including situations where the ball starts at greater than terminal velocity. Students show an aptitude for representing up to 6 characteristics of the ball with 2 hands. They switch quickly while talking about velocity, acceleration, and the different forces, frequently representing more than one quantity using a single hand. We believe that much of their thinking resides in their hands, and that their gestures complement their speech, as indicated by moments when speech and gesture represent different quantities.",Evan Chase,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4596,University of Maine,"Michael Wittmann, University of Maine",2012

In previous work, we observed that students likelihood of correctly answering a kinematics question easily solved through common sense depended on whether preceding questions on the survey were designed to prime sense-making or schoolish answer-making [3]. To get insight into students reasoning on the survey we collected 24 think-aloud protocols [4].  The think-aloud data indicate some participants who incorrectly answered the kinematics question misinterpreted the physical situation it describes.  This observation might be seen as evidence the question lacks psychometric validity.  However, analysis indicates that students misinterpret the question because of how they frame their approach to answering it.  So, misinterpretation of the kinematics question is a signal of epistemological framing, not an impediment to seeing it.",Paul Hutchison,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4547,Grinnell College,"Andy Elby, University of Maryland - College Park",2012
4818,Contributed Poster Presentation,Examining the integration of physics equations in students biological reasoning,"Policy documents advocate for greater integration of physics and mathematics into biology curricula. However, there has been little research on how students make use of physics and mathematics in biological reasoning. To address this need, we examine how students use physics equations when discussing diffusion and circulation in interviews. We present two cases: one where a student leverages the specific algebraic form of these equations in building a biological explanation and one where this is not observed. By connecting analysis of observed reasoning patterns with their expressed epistemological beliefs, we highlight implications for thinking about the physics-biology integration. In particular, our findings suggest that making something quantitative just for the sake of making something quantitative does not necessarily add value and may have negative consequences for students expressed views about equations.",Jessica Watkins,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4818,Tufts University,"Chandra Turpen, University of Maryland, College Park",2012

Both sequences are implemented over five bi-weekly meetings. Written reports were evaluated using the same rubrics as those used to assess scientific reasoning abilities in ISLE labs, so our findings are directly comparable with results reported from Rutgers.

In the current work, we present data collected over multiple semesters of a calculus-based introductory physics class indicating that women feel a lower sense of belonging than men in physics. This finding is important because our data also indicate that having a strong sense of belonging in physics positively predicts the degree to which all students see the value of physics in their daily life  an outcome that predicts motivation and persistence in achievement settings  as well as performance on exams in the course. We identify one potential antecedent of womens relatively lower sense of belonging in physics, namely, negative cultural stereotypes about womens inferior ability in physics compared to men.

Hands-on activities, group projects, and a supportive instructor emerged among leading contributions, while frustration and lower-than-expected grades were found to be detractors.

This seems contradictory until one remembers that a complete probability distribution is determined by the total multiplicity of the system and its surroundings, requiring the product of these two functions.

On these questions, many students demonstrate that they possess abilities to do the type of reasoning required for the problem, yet they fail to apply this reasoning to arrive at a correct answer.  In certain contexts, students tend to abandon the appropriate formal reasoning in favor of reasoning that was (perhaps) more intuitively appealing at that moment.  In other cases, erroneous student reasoning approaches can be attributed to the (relative) salience of specific features of the problem.  Results from introductory physics courses, in which Tutorials in Introductory Physics  were implemented as interactive lectures, will be presented.

We are investigating student difficulties with the FTC, and extending the work in mathematics to include situations relevant in physics. Questions administered as written surveys and individual interviews in calculus-based introductory physics and multivariable calculus classes focused on the determination of signs of integrals, primarily in graphical representations. Negative integrals in particular provided a rich context for the FTC application. We find that students use the FTC as a computational tool without understanding the underlying concepts.

Pedagogically, we use an easy-to-implement intervention, the ACCESS protocol, to develop and assess problem-solving skills in our SCALE-UP classroom environment for algebra-based physics. Based on our research and teaching experience, an important question has emerged: while primarily targeting improvements in problem-solving and cognitive development, is it necessary that conceptual understanding be compromised? To address this question, we gathered and analyzed information about student abilities, backgrounds, and instructional preferences.

Reasons range from doubt that tiny humans could affect an entire planet to belief that human life on Earth will soon end. Science is about experimental data, reasoning from those data, and theoretical perspectives supported by the data. Svante Arrhenius provided (in 1896) the first theoretical (and compelling) reasons that carbon dioxide could influence Earths energy budget. Multiple sources of modern data underlie the belief of virtually all climate scientists that humans are changing the climate. The evidence is based on temperature measurements, satellite observations, ice-core sampling, statistical analyses, sea level measurements, observations of plant and animal behavior, and other sorts of measurements.

We hypothesized that the reason for student difficulties is the mismatch between the context of learning and assessment. The mismatch occurred as students encountered conceptual questions as a part of their group work in class but the quiz required individual work. To test our hypothesis we added conceptual questions to the student's homework problem sets to match the individual aspect of student learning and the conceptual focus.

Groups were divided and taught separately with an emphasis on either mathematical derivation and application of equations, followed by brief conceptual discussions, or on thorough conceptual analysis, followed by a brief mathematical verification. After a posttest was given, an evaluation of the responses and explanations of each group of students was used to determine which method of instruction yielded greater learning gains among the two groups.

When students enter our college physics class they most likely associate school learning with rote memorization and have lost a sense of what it means to learn for understanding. Research shows that a two-pronged approach is needed for students to take a deep approach to learning: 1) The learning environment has to support deep understanding, and 2) attention must be paid to change students conceptions of learning and motivate them to take the plunge. In designing our introductory physics course we focused on a) aligning all course elements to promote deep learning, b) implementing specific activities to help students access productive deep learning resources that they dont normally associate with school learning, and c) motivating students to take the difficult path to deep understanding.

Initial correlation analysis reveals that item difficulty, as determined by student exam performance, is not easily explained by variation in cognitive level.  Results relevant to student learning in introductory physics courses will be presented.",Mila Kryjevskaia,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4541,North Dakota State University,"Erika G.

4631,Contributed Poster Presentation,Promoting Student Agency and Communication in an Informal Science Program,"The Partnerships for Informal Science Education in the Community (PISEC) program at the University of Colorado Boulder brings together university and community institutions to create a space where K-12 students join with University educators to engage in inquiry-based scientific practices after school. These afterschool activities were originally developed to reinforce the traditional learning goals of the classroom, including mastering scientific content, skills and processes. Recently, the primary focus of the PISEC curriculum has been shifted towards the development of students scientific identity, an explicit objective of informal learning environments. The new curriculum offers students more activity choices, affords space for scientific drawings and descriptions and provides incentive for students to design their own experiments. We have analyzed student science notebooks from both old and new curricula and find that with the redesigned curriculum, students exhibit increased agency and more instances of scientific communication while still demonstrating substantial content learning gains.",Rosemary Wulf,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4631,University of Colorado Boulder,"Kathleen Hinko (University of Colorado Boulder), Noah Finkelstein (University of Colorado Boulder)",2012
4569,Contributed Poster Presentation,Quest in the Physics Classroom,"When teachers look for good practices in the classroom, they usually consider strategies for teaching individual topics. However, in order to attain mastery, students also need to fit together topics to create a broader landscape of learning.  To aid physics students in this, the concept of quest is proposed, wherein students link materials learned in previous sections toward a goal of understanding the following subject matter. Quest encourages students to press forward in their inquiry, as opposed to just ticking off another topic on the syllabus. As a goal-driven endeavor, the quest may be useful in creating a sense of excitement in the students. Do teachers use the unifying technique of quest, even informally? In this presentation, based on surveys of high school teachers, strategies teachers use in the classroom is explored as well as receptiveness to using the educational technique of quest. Multicultural attitudes will also be delved into.",Anne Tabor-Morris,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4569,Georgian Court University,,2012

This reflective discourse is used in a classroom at Lane Community College, where the instructor explicitly has discourse goals in his course structure. We investigated whether students mimic this discourse when solving problems outside of the classroom context.  In order to examine this, we interviewed groups of students in this calculus-based introductory physics class, after the end of spring term 2012. The students were asked to solve open-ended problems using a think aloud protocol in small groups, with analysis of their discourse focused on whether students applied the reflective discourse practiced during the course. Students were then asked a series of follow-up questions to reflect upon their experiences in the course. This paper will address the findings of this study.",Wendi Wampler,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4658,Oregon State University,"Dedra Demaree

The data was collected from 1,344 students of 18 high school physics teachers. In this analysis we utilized the teacher, FCI Pre Score, Gender, and Ethnic Representation as the independent variables and FCI Post Score as the dependent variable. The regression analysis returned an effect size of .37 (Cohens f2) and indicated that 12 out of 18 high school physics teachers had a significant impact in accounting for the variance within student FCI Post Scores. Further analysis showed that of the 12 teachers accounting for a significant amount of the variance, only five had a positive beta coefficient.  This indicates that there are dynamic differences between teachers that may be revealed through other measures such as the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP).",Jonathan Mahadeo,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4551,Florida International University,"Dr. Eric Brewe

In the Energy Project, a professional development effort, teachers constructed a set of laws relating energy changes with forces.  At first glance their laws bear little resemblance to the work-energy theorem.  However, these laws are not only consistent with the work-energy theorem, but they present the theorem in a way that is deeply causal. In this paper, I discuss how the representational system of Energy Theater facilitated the development of causal laws, drawing on Sherins (1995) work on how symbol systems affect students conceptualization of physics, in which he concluded algebra-physics can be characterized as a physics of balance and equilibrium, and programming-physics a physics of processes and causation (p. 421).",Leslie J.

Throughout this process, we examine both implicit and explicit indexing of the disciplines throughout the reasoning episode to show that often these connections span disciplinary boundaries.  Independent of whether reconciliation is achieved, we see coherence-seeking as essential to scientific practice and as such we claim that coherence-seeking should be a focus of our assessment efforts.",Chandra Turpen,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4497,"Dept. of Physics [1] & Dept. of Chemical and Life Sciences [3], University of Maryland, College Park","Benjamin W.

The classroom activity used bulbs and batteries to let students (a) discover how current flows through a circuit by using evidence (bulb brightness) to distinguish the difference in current through series or parallel circuits, and (b) learn to measure voltage and compare voltage drops across bulbs in various arrangements.  A new series and parallel lab addressed students preconceptions and filled a need for an introductory lab to supplement a combination circuit lab.

But what features must a set of questions have to do a good job of distinguishing experts from novices?  To answer this question, we re-examine the seminal study by Chi et al., which firmly established the notion that novices categorize physics problems by ""surface features"" (e.g. ""incline,"" ""pendulum,"" ""projectile motion,"" ...), while experts use ""deep structure"" (e.g., ""energy conservation,"" ""Newton 2,"" ...). We studied the categorizations of known physics experts and novices using a set of 50 introductory physics problems.  A novel statistical approach allowed us to compare any two categorizations on the basis of problem identity alone.  Then, by applying this method repeatedly to small subsets of our original 50 problem set we determined how accurately we could classify experts and novices based on the pedagogical and contextual features of the questions being posed.  We found that the number of questions required to accurately classify experts and novices could be surprisingly small so long as particular pedagogical and contextual features were present.",Steven Wolf,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4466,Michigan State University,"Daniel Dougherty, Gerd Kortemeyer",2012

Students must elicit and confront these misconceptions in order to construct a mental model of how pulley systems work.  We report on a study with students in a conceptual physics laboratory using either physical or virtual manipulatives to investigate forces in pulley systems.  Written materials guided students through a sequence of activities designed to scaffold their model construction process.  The activity sequences facilitated students sense making by requiring them to make and test predictions about various pulley systems by building and comparing different systems.

Those expectations have an influence on the way that students make observations, reason about phenomena, and draw conclusions. In certain situations, those expectations may be inconsistent with those of the physics community and lead to results that are inconsistent with the body of knowledge in physics. We designed a new group learning activity that was intended to support students in model-building and finding coherence between multiple representations in the context of an underdamped harmonic system. During this activity, students mostly relied on qualitative expectations about the systems velocity and an expected mathematical solution, both of which were inappropriate for this system. At the same time, they displayed expectations about coherence between symbolic, graphical, and qualitative representations that would typically be productive, but this was not enough in this situation for building the appropriate model.",Adam Kaczynski,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4655,University of Maine,"Michael C.

In addition, we have previously reported that students tend to respond with a different relationship between net force and velocity if they are given the net force and asked about the velocity vs. if they are given the velocity and asked about the net force. Here we report on student responses from a set of contextual situations with varying numbers of forces on an object. In these situations students are asked either about the forces on the object, including the possibility of a force of motion, or students are asked to give the direction of the net force. This comparison allows for a better understanding of the students perceptions of the similarities and differences between net force and force-of-motion. Results indicate that the difficulties students have with force of motion may not be the same as the difficulties that students have with net force and/or that the solution path taken in the two cases is different. Either way, the resources used by students for these net force questions and force of motion questions are different, and considering these differences allows for a better understanding of the nature of the well-known student confusion between net force and velocity.",Rebecca Rosenblatt,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4813,Illinois State University,"Andrew Heckler

Some students describe hierarchical arrangements that order the disciplines by degree of system complexity, or by the scale used to examine a particular system.   In other instances students want physics embedded in a context that positions its relationship to biology via analogy, or reference the way in which general physical principles like energy conservation or entropy maximization impose constraints on biological systems.

The remaining 42% (8 in 19) of the cohort generated a mental image. None of the students was classified as constructing a mental model. A trend was observed in how students with these two kinds of cognitive structures handle multiple external representations.

In canonical physics education research tasks, students are asked to identify a correct answer and justify their answer choice.

4621,Contributed Poster Presentation,"Students Understanding of Dot Product as a Projection in No-context, Work and Electric Flux Problems","In this article we investigate students understanding of dot product as a projection. In the first part, we compare students performance in three isomorphic multiple-choice problems: no-context, work and electric flux. We administered one of the three problems to 422 students completing all introductory physics courses. In the second part, we analyze students ability to connect the physical concepts with the dot product formal representation. We carried out interviews with 14 students, in which they answered the three same isomorphic problems. In the test administration we found a difference that was statistically significant: both physical context problems help students select the projection interpretation option. However, the percentages of students that select this option remained very low in the three problems. Moreover, in the interviews we noticed that students have serious difficulties to develop a coherent conceptual framework between the physical concepts and the dot product formal representation.",Genaro Zavala,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4621,Tecnologico de Monterrey,Pablo Barniol,2012
4678,Contributed Poster Presentation,Supporting scientific writing and evaluation in a conceptual physics course with Calibrated Peer Review,"Writing tasks are one way students can apply science concepts, yet evaluating students writing can be difficult in large classes. With the web-based Calibrated Peer Review* (CPR) system, students submit written work and evaluate each other. Students write a response to a prompt, read and evaluate responses prepared by the curriculum developers, and receive feedback on their evaluations, allowing students to calibrate their evaluation skills. Students then evaluate their peers work and their own work. We have used CPR for two semesters in conceptual physics courses with enrollments of ~100 students. By independently assessing students responses, we evaluated the CPR calibration process and compared students peer reviews with expert evaluations. We find little relationship between the CPR systems measure of students reviewing competency and our independent determination. Nevertheless, students scores on their essays correlate with our independent evaluations.  This poster describes these findings and our experiences with implementing CPR assignments.",Edward Price,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4678,California State University San Marcos,"Fred Goldberg, San Diego State University

Central in resolving that debate is the development of appropriate measures of students understanding of the nature of science.  We report on a course in which students engaged in sophisticated scientific practices, and yet student responses to a standard nature of science survey showed surprisingly few pre-post changes.

In the classroom, students respond to conceptual questions, discuss with peers and then respond again. Student response patterns (or switching) provide the instructor with real-time feedback of student understanding and are used to guide the discussion during class.  But how do these switching patterns relate to other dimensions of student learning? Does switching tell us more about students' confidence than understanding? How can we better understand this behavior that is essentially steering the course?

4549,Contributed Poster Presentation,Teaching Graphs in Introductory Physics: Interpretation vs. Construction,"It is generally agreed that the ability to visualize functional dependencies or physical relationships as graphs is an important step in modeling and learning. However, several studies in PER have shown that many students in fact do not master this form of representation and even have misconceptions about the meaning of graphs that impede learning physics concepts. Thus, time needs to be taken in instruction to address these issues. Electronic homework could provide a time-efficient means to give students an opportunity to practice graphing, yet most mainstream course management systems are at best capable of providing interpretation exercises. We believe the ability to construct a graph is of a fundamentally different quality from merely interpreting a given graph, and thus implemented a new graph construction homework type in the LON-CAPA course management system. A study of pre/post-test data using the Test of Understanding Graphs in Kinematics (TUG-K) over several semesters indicates that students learn significantly more from these graph construction problems than from the usual graph interpretation problems and that graph interpretation alone may not have any significant effect.",James T.

Analyzing TA-student interactions and subsequent student responses can help us better understand this connection. Yet, when we examine these interactions and responses, we find a complex web of expressions from which we must derive meaning. Several tools have been developed that can assist us in this analysis. But many of these tools, by themselves, focus either too narrowly or too broadly on the data to give us a complete picture. We present one possible method of analysis that uses a combination of these tools to explore data at various grain sizes in an attempt to better describe the interactions and responses we see.

Findings suggest that through participating in teaching activities, LAs tend to move toward of view of teaching and learning focused on students construction of physics content, and teaching strategies that are adapted to individual students.  We conclude that the repetition of thinking about how students learn, constructing interventions, and reflecting on the results of their actions leads LAs to converge on certain ways of behaving and talking that are more closely aligned with the goals of the LA program.

4498,Contributed Poster Presentation,The Dependence of Instructional Outcomes on Students' Individual Differences:  An Example from Simple DC Circuits,"In a study of student understanding of the power dissipated through simple networks of resistors, two consistent, contradictory response patterns were identified: a greater equivalent resistance always dissipates more power, and a lesser equivalent resistance always dissipates more power.  After completing one of two sequences of practice-questions, the performance of students who had initially thought that less resistance meant more power improved, while the performance of the opposing group did not -- despite one of the practice sequences specifically addressing the idea that more resistance means more power.  Because one prior conception appears to be susceptible to practice while the other does not, specific attention must be given to interactions between differing ideas and the physical concept being taught.

We found from a correlational study that students who perceived their instructors to be more supportive of their autonomy tended to perform better and become more interested and less anxious about learning physics.  We also considered the effects of the amount of student autonomy built into the course format.

Concerning the need for understanding subatomic-world, physics educators have recently argued that some quantum physics concepts (QPCs) should be introduced to students starting from high school (Ireson, 2000). Based on these arguments, we focused on current state-level standards and the first draft of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) to examine the extent to which they address QPCs. The NGSS essentially define the minimum of what all students should learn by the time they finish high school.

Our results show that pre-instruction the academically strongest students in the class tend to underestimate their score slightly, whereas the weakest students overestimate their performance significantly. These results are consistent with the findings of Rebello and demonstrate a well-known cognitive bias (the Dunning-Kruger effect). Post-instruction, we find that the ability of the weakest quartile cohort to accurately predict their own assessment score has improved significantly, and is no longer different to the average discrepancy in predicted score from any other quartile post-instruction.

4797,Contributed Poster Presentation,The impact of visual representation on knowledge activation during problem solving,"Instructors frequently observe that students sometimes have significant difficulty activating relevant physics knowledge that they seemingly possess during problem solving. We propose that at least part of the difficulty might be caused by the conventional visual representation used in teaching those knowledge. Most conventional physics representations are developed under the physical limits of pen and paper, and are not optimized to facilitate sense making among novices. When examined from a grounded cognition perspective, some of these representations may interfere with students proper construction of conceptual understanding, and encourage shallow/rote learning of physics rules. Physics rules learned by rote requires a more precise matching of surface features to activate, and poses a higher cognitive cost during implementation. In a clinical study, we demonstrated that by improving the design of physics representation using computer animation, we can change the physics rules activated by students solving certain capacitor circuit problems. Interestingly, this improved representation design shares less surface feature similarity with the problem body when compared to the conventional representation and students are observed to spend less time watching the improved design.",Zhongzhou Chen,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4797,UIUC,"Gary, Gladding

As part of this study we interviewed 15 faculty at the beginning and end of each semester they taught an introductory course and collected student evaluation data.  From the analysis of these interviews it is clear that faculty practices are directly influenced by students' reactions, both positively and negatively.  When students liked the innovations and responded positively, either by directly expressing their pleasure or by their increased participation in the course activities, faculty were motivated to continue using and possibly increase their level of use of research-based innovations.  Likewise, when faculty reported backing off of innovation use, it was most often due to student complaints about the innovation use and/or students not engaging in course activities.  It is unclear from our study why some faculty were successful at gaining student buy-in but others were not.

We track the role of affect through a series of mounting tensions and the release of those tensions as students come up with alternate explanations.

The process was repeated after three weeks during which more training was provided.  Results indicate no significant improvement of argumentation on team training tasks over this period, but a statistically significant improvement on individual transfer tasks.

We propose that connections between elements of identity, persistence, and participation in an LA program can be explained using the concept of the community of practice and its intimate relationship to identity (2). In separate work, Hazari et al. found that physics identity was highly correlated to expressed career plans in physics (3). We hypothesize that a thriving LA program has many features of a well-functioning community of practice and contributes to all four elements of physics identity: personal interest, student performance, competence, and recognition by others. We explore how this analysis of the LA experience might shape decisions and influence outcomes of adoption and adaptations of the LA model.

4633,Contributed Poster Presentation,Using collaborative group exams to measure students ability to learn,"One of our primary learning goals for our students is: we would like them to be able to learn physics on their own. Unfortunately few existing assessments can assess students ability to learn without being taught. We are developing an exam format which challenges students to work together as a class to tackle a difficult problem that requires them to learn new physics. Rather than restrict their activities, we offer them a resource-rich environment of textbooks and internet access. Students are required to transfer their knowledge by answering a related question on a more standard individual exam the next day.  In this poster we will discuss the format of the exams, background theory, and present evidence of how students are able to learn new physics on their own. Our results show that although students struggle at first, they do surprisingly well once they get used to the format.",David T.

4524,Contributed Poster Presentation,Using internet based computer coaches for introductory physics problem-solving,"The Physics Education Group at the University of Minnesota has been constructing web-based programs that can provide introductory physics students with coaching in the use of an expert-like framework in solving problems. During the Fall 2011 semester, the coaches were introduced into a large (200+ students) section of the introductory mechanics course at the University of Minnesota to assess their usability and gauge students opinions on using them, and also to conduct a pilot study on their educational impact. In this paper, we present results from that implementation, using a problem-solving rubric to analyze students' written solutions to problems on mid-semester quizzes and the final exam. The rubric evaluates a student's problem-solving performance along five axes based on expert-novice problem solving research. Other diagnostic results such as the FCI and CLASS survey will also be included to give a more comprehensive picture of the educational impact of the coaches.",Qing Xu,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4524,University of Minnesota-- Twin Cities,"Leon Hsu, Ken Heller, University of Minnesota-- Twin Cities

Students include some mixture of definitions (both mathematical and otherwise), equations (both general and specific), unit information, physical constants, statements of laws or concepts, math review, guides to symbols and variables, diagrams, and worked examples.  I compare my two classes, look at some individual students in depth, and try to gain insight on how we can use these artifacts to see what students perceive as important in the courses (or at least what's worth committing to paper).",Timothy McCaskey,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4510,Columbia College Chicago,,2012
4535,Contributed Poster Presentation,Utilization of Hands-on and Simulation Activities for Teaching Middle School Lunar Concepts,"A great deal of literature exists surrounding the misconceptions that students have regarding the moon, specifically how the moon phases and eclipses occur.  These studies provide teachers with information regarding what misconceptions their students may come to the classroom with as well as some ideas as to how to approach and correct them.  However, these methods are not always validated with classroom-based research, and much of the research that has been done is in the high school and college setting.  As such, we have undertaken a study to investigate what a group of middle school students know about the moon pre-instruction, and how hands-on activities and computer simulations affect student learning and understanding of these topics.  The results of this project show that neither supplementation was distinguishably more effective in improving student test scores, as measured by Hake gains; this may be an artifact of high pre-test scores, as described herein.",Reni Roseman,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4535,Mercyhurst University,Dyan L Jones,2012

For some pretest question we have accumulated thousands of responses, from dozens of course sections representing different conditions with respect to class composition, prior instruction, etc. In this paper three questions serve as representative examples. For each question, we examine the variation in student performance (defined as the proportion of students who answered correctly) across all sections for which data are available, and for subsets of the data categorized according to the amount of relevant prior instruction each class had received.",Paula Heron,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4518,University of Washington,,2012

Data was collected weekly using conceptual surveys from students attending Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and the United States Military Academy at West Point throughout the introductory calculus-based physics sequence.  Students view problems involving vector concepts and problems involving scalar concepts differently depending on whether the current topic of instruction is vectors or scalars.

We surveyed n=63 students in a calculus-based introductory mechanics course about what they think thinking like a physicist means, as well as what kinds of reasoning they can do now but used to be difficult for them, what they do when they are stuck on a problem, and how they know when they understand a topic or problem well. Nearly half of the students report visualization and understanding physics questions as reasoning that used to be difficult for them. A similar fraction of students consider being able to solve problems straightforwardly as the primary indicator of their understanding of a physics concept or problem. We coded students responses and performed a cluster analysis to identify groups of students with similar patterns of responses.

4561,Contributed Poster Presentation,What Do We Really Mean By That Word? Identifying Skills in the Work of Categorizing and Defining,"An important part of doing research is crafting useful definitions for one's particular purposes.  Scientists need to be able to identify vague or unscientific terms and meanings and refine them into clearly articulated ideas.  This work is not done in isolation, but rather, members of the community must come together to decide on mutually agreed upon definitions.  But how are words defined and mutual understanding achieved?  What skills do physics students already have along these lines and what new skills must be supported?  And how does language itself support and constrain this work?  This talk will focus on a study of undergraduate physics majors where small groups of 3-4 students are asked to categorize and define the physical phenomenon of threshold in an open-ended design task.  We will present on skills we have identified as important to making definitions and discuss ways that language plays an important role in this process.",Angela Little,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4561,"University of California, Berkeley",,2012
4590,Contributed Poster Presentation,What can middle school students teach us about effective simulation design?,"While most PhET simulations are designed for college, they are often used at lower levels, including middle school (MS). We are now studying how MS students interact with and learn from these simulations, extracting insights about design for this grade-level and more broadly. Here, we present a case study of the methods and design philosophy involved in redesigning a simulation  Energy Skate Park (ESP)  for effective use in MS.  We conducted think-aloud interviews with MS students, identifying features that caused confusion or unproductive distraction, as well as features inconsistent with grade-appropriate learning goals.  Drawing on these data and our broader research base, we developed Energy Skate Park Basics (ESPB). Interviews on ESPB demonstrate increased usability and learning for MS students. We suggest that the success of ESPB is due to age-appropriate implicit scaffolding, a design framework that reduces the amount of explicit instruction needed to facilitate learning.",Ariel Paul,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4590,PhET - University of Colorado at Boulder,"Noah Podolefsky (PhET

This poster is presented by a former LA, now a doctoral student in Computer Science Education, who is now teaching and modifying the LA pedagogy course at CU Boulder. As one of the first LAs for the Applied Mathematics department, a unique perspective is brought to the LA pedagogy course which was initially designed by a physics education researcher and a high school physics teacher. Since the pedagogy course reaches diverse STEM student majors, the course must continually be made relevant for all students. Here we present a unique perspective from two angles: (1) from the angle of a computer science/math major teaching in what was a physics-centric LA pedagogy course and (2) the perspective of a former LA who is now taking action toward educational change. Finally, we discuss this final measure of success of the LA program that is rarely discussed in the literature: the recruitment of LAs into advanced doctoral programs in STEM education as they establish their agenda for educational change.",Ian Her Many Horses,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4817,University of Colorado at Boulder,"Valerie Otero, University of Colorado at Boulder",2012

The interrogation method, which prompts students to read sentences from the text and answer, Why is this true? has been developed to enhance students ability to read science texts. To enact this method, instructors must choose sentences that are both important conceptually and deeply interrogatable. We explored the use of this method in an introductory physics course for non-physics majors. The teaching assistants, learning assistants, and the course instructor chose sentences for each chapter of the text, and the students were asked to interrogate 2-4 of the sentences each chapter. We analyzed the conceptual importance of the sentences and their interrogatability, as well as their underlying epistemologies. We then analyzed the accuracy and epistemologies of the student responses. Based on the analysis of the chosen sentences and student responses, we developed a model for choosing productive sentences to interrogate.",Robert Zisk,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4496,Rutgers University,"Elana Resnick, Rutgers University

By evaluating pre and post course results from the CLASS, previous publications have shown that students tend to have a less expert-like opinion of studying physics after taking an introductory physics class.  Although this result was seen in the data provided here, we also saw that by merely waiting until after the winter break and surveying the same students at the beginning of the second term, their opinions appeared to shift back towards the more expert-like end.  Although the statistics in this data sample are limited, the Winter Break Effect shown may imply that student opinions evaluated by the CLASS may depend on when in the term the survey is given.",Tom Carter,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4625,College of DuPage,,2012

This study presents results from an investigation of 3rd grade students discourse about how length and tension affect the sound produced by a string. These students came from a variety of language backgrounds, and all were learning English as a second language. Our results demonstrate varying levels and uses of experiential, imaginative, and mechanistic reasoning strategies. Using specific examples from students discourse, we will demonstrate some of the productive and challenging aspects of working within multiple language frameworks for making sense of physics.

To gain insight into such interactions, we used video data from a Florida International University reformed Physics I classroom. We micro-analyzed a segment in which the discourse between a group of three students leads to the resolution of a concern.

4635,Plenary,"Cultural variations in epistemological orientations: Impacts on knowledge, meanings, and reasoning about the natural world","Increasingly, learning scholars have focused on how race, culture and class have been used to define deficit-oriented discourses about students from non-dominant communities understandings, thinking, experiences, and language use (e.g., what comprises an effective explanation or convincing data; what smart looks and sounds like) and restrict the intellectual opportunities these youth have to learn in school (e.g. Lee, 2009; Gutierrez et. al, 2009; Barton & Tan, 2008). We have sought to understand how these issues place epistemological demands on Indigenous students, specifically in thinking and sense-making about the natural world towards the goal of creating more affective learning environments. Through a micro-analysis of two contexts, one an informal interaction between a child and their parent, and one in a learning environment, I explore how relational epistemologies, and variations in causality and inference are embedded in these issues and raise questions and possibilities in the design of learning environments.",Megan Bang,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4635,University of Washington,,2012

These identities are shifting and changeable, and are developed in relation to other people in the context. Second, I'll talk about social identity: a sense of self --or a perception of others -- based on socially meaningful categories like race or gender. These identities are seen as quite static (although they may not be experienced that way) and are related to broader systems of oppression in society. I will give examples from my research in mathematics education, and discuss how these concepts can be useful in the study of physics education.",Indigo Esmonde,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4636,University of Toronto,,2012
4637,Plenary,When Everyday and Scientific Concepts Grow Into One Another: Syncretic and Connected Learning,"As schools become increasingly irrelevant to meaningful learning for young people, they also fail in fulfilling their social equalizing agenda. There is a growing disconnect between the interests and everyday practices of our nation's students and formal schooling's approaches to engaging them in rigorous, meaningful, and relevant learning. Of concern, there are social and cognitive, as well as personal, institutional, and economic consequences to disconnected learning. Today's students move across a range of contexts and produce artifacts that reflect the intercultural, hybrid, and multimodal practices of which they are part.  These repertoires developed across the ecologies of interest and everyday life should be cultivated as important dimensions to consequential learning. From a cultural historical learning perspective, transformative learning involves shifts between and across new combinations of contexts and tools that can be leveraged across ecologies and domains of learning (Engestrom, 2003; Gutierrez, 2008). Drawing on the best of what we know about how people learn, this paper focuses on how we can ratchet up learning across a range of ecologies by designing openings and forms of support that create opportunities for new learning pathways into the future. In particular, it focuses on the affordances of syncretic and connected learning approaches in supporting the development of toolkits that have utility across tasks, purposes, disciplinary boundaries, learning environments, and future-oriented trajectories and identities.",Kris D.

4638,Plenary,Where do physics students come from and what do they become? A look at knowledge and identity pathways through and beyond school experience,"In this talk, I will present a perspective that conceptualizes learning in cultural practice terms.  Cultural practices are differently sized patterns of interaction among people and things to which people orient and hold each other accountable. Learning then involves coming to participate in these patterns of interaction and undergoing possible changes to body, mind, and identity in the process. Cultural practices are often knotted together to make normative cultural paths, through and around which people traverse specific pathways.
Drawing on a conceptual framework for studying young peoples learning pathways toward becoming engineers (Stevens et al., 2008), this presentation will examine the knowledge and identity formation processes in everyday physics, physics education, and professional physics. I will consider an additional dimension of importance, how people individually and with cultural support, navigate through sanctioned institutional passage points and rituals.

Further, by in-depth case studies of LAs' experiences, their experiences in the pedagogy course, and their written and verbal reflections, we establish models of identity through participation that can help us understand why the program is effective and what it truly affects. Ultimately, by critically evaluating traditional measures of program effectiveness in light of explanatory models of LA program effectiveness, we seek to establish an agenda for future research on personal and social elements that are critical to the success of an LA-style program, or any program that capitalizes on the development of identity through participation.",Valerie Otero,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4807,University of Colorado at Boulder,"Kara E.

4601,Poster Symposium,Social Hierarchies and Accessibility in Physics,"The establishment of hierarchical social structures, either explicit and conscious or implicit and unconscious, can hinder student participation resulting in their marginalization and disengagement.  As part of the regular process of education, students experience social hierarchies in their studies stemming from aspects of their ""invisible backpacks"" and from day-to-day experiences in the classroom.  In this symposium, we explore how social hierarchies arising from both of these sources are formed and the implications for student engagement with physics, physics identity development, and physics participation.  In the former case, the impacts of sociocultural factors (including immigrant generation and college generation) are examined with respect to physical science career interests.  In the latter case, the effects of teacher practices including positioning and authoritativeness on student engagement and attachment to physics are studied.

4724,Symposium Poster,Cookies as agents for community membership,"When becoming a member of a community of practice, a novice must adopt certain community norms to participate, and these include the social norms of the group. Using the analytical perspective of Legitimate Peripheral Participation in a Community of Practice, this paper explores the social role of cookies as agents for community participation and membership in one physics research group. We analyze data from an ethnographic case study of a physics research group weekly research meeting. The mentors bring cookies to each meeting and view the cookies as a token of appreciation for the graduate students' work. These cookies take on a subtler role of initiating guests and students into scientific conversations and participation. Via the cookies, members also share personal histories and stories that help members validate their participation. The study of social norms in this research group is part of a larger study of physics expert identity development.",Idaykis Rodriguez,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4724,Florida International University,"Renee Michelle Goertzen, Eric Brewe, and Laird Kramer",2012
4697,Symposium Poster,Critical Classroom Structures for Empowering Students to Participate in Science,"We compared contextual characteristics that impacted the nature and substance of ""summarizing discussions"" between a physics and a chemistry classroom in an Hispanic-serving urban high school.  Specifically, we evaluate structural components of curricula necessary to develop a culture of critical inquiry.  Through implementing the Physics and Everyday Thinking (PET) curriculum in the physics course, we found that students' participation in summarizing discussions demonstrated critical thinking, critical evaluation, and use of laboratory evidence to support ideas. We then implemented a model similar to PET in the chemistry course. However, chemistry students' participatory statements lacked evidence, opposition and critical evaluation, and required greater teacher facilitation. We hypothesize that the designed laboratories and the research basis of PET influenced the extent to which physics students verbalized substantive scientific thought, authentic appeals to evidence, and a sense of empowerment to participate in the classroom scientific community. Classroom data and teacher reflections will be discussed.",Shelly Belleau,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4697,University of Colorado at Boulder and Mapleton Expeditionary School of the Arts,,2012
4714,Symposium Poster,Cross-Concept Inventory Research Starting with the Force Concept Inventory,"In today's globally-engaged and technology-rich educational environments, an online resource where concept inventory (CI) developers and users can access, discuss, develop, and refine concept inventories and their uses is a needed resource.  ciHUB.org meets this need by providing a shared space to researchers and users where inventories can be uploaded and focused discussions can ensue.  Because a wide variety of different CIs can be gathered in this one-stop virtual community, the gathering of data across multiple CIs and longitudinal tracking of student learning is now possible.  Therefore, this type of community facilitates research not just within a specific topic area relative to a specific CI, but it also allows research between CIs.  For example, the Force Concept Inventory might be the correct pre-test to the Concept Assessment Tool for Statics, typically a second-year course in the engineering curriculum.  This type of research could have larger implications as CI development progresses into upper division course content.",Teri Reed-Rhoads,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4714,"School of Engineering Education, College of Engineering, Purdue University","P.K.

Through this work we have begun to recognize specific cultural norms that our students bring to the classroom.  These cultural norms appear to help our students establish strong communities in classes.  Because of the homogeneity of our population, with most students coming from within a five-mile radius of our campus, there are a set of shared experiences that help establish a level of trust and sense of community that manifests itself in the science learning environment.  Aspects of community also play a major role in the preparation of teachers.  In this talk we discuss our understanding of CSU student culture, its importance in the development of community, and its role in our physics classrooms as well as its role in the preparation of future physics teachers.",Mel Sabella,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4695,Chicago State University,Andrea G.

But once validity and reliability are established, it is not the end of the story.  Reliability and validity are not an inherent property of the assessment instrument or its individual items, but something that must be reestablished with any changes of the instrument items, order, administration techniques or population being studied.

4713,Symposium Poster,"Expanding access to assessing conceptual understanding: ciHUB.org, a virtual community supporting conceptual learning","Transforming learning environments for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students requires merging of theories of learning and state-of-the-art assessment tools that allow faculty to identify patterns of conceptual understanding and misconceptions. Conventional measurement/evaluation approaches typically do not help faculty discover the extent to which students have actually acquired conceptual fluency within a particular subject. To this end, STEM disciplines are increasingly using Concept Inventory (CI) assessment to measure the value-added to student learning through new methods of teaching important material. 

The paper describes the creation of a virtual community referred to as ciHUB.org, which is a cohesive, borderless community of CI developers, researchers, faculty and students. This national/international collaborative effort was created to support both: a) continued development, refinement, analysis, and application of multiple CI instruments; and b) engagement of the engineering STEM education community in productive conversations about assessing and improving conceptual understanding.",P.K.

4504,Symposium Poster,Identifying Student Difficulties with Conflicting Ideas in Statistical Mechanics,"In statistical mechanics there are two quantities that directly relate to the probability that a system at a temperature fixed by a thermal reservoir has a particular energy. The density of states function is related to the multiplicity of the system and indicates that occupation probability increases with energy. The Boltzmann factor is related to the multiplicity of the reservoir and indicates that occupation probability decreases with energy. This seems contradictory until one remembers that a complete probability distribution is determined by the total multiplicity of the system and its surroundings, requiring the product of these two functions. We present evidence from individual and group interviews that students knew how each of these functions relates to multiplicity but did not recognize the need to combine the two to characterize the physical scenario.",Trevor I.

Networks of social interactions have preciously been used to get snapshot pictures of broad aspects of student interactions. Here, I include (1) multiple interaction categories and (2) student self reports of these multiple interaction categories over a period of a semester to create sequences of different types of specific academic and social networks. The cohort is primarily first year physics majors from a Danish university. Once established, a cluster algorithm splits each network into groups of students. The stability across categories and time of groups as well as the attributes of students in each group characterize the cohort as a set of communities of practice. Seen in this way, the networks investigate the dynamics of quantifiable aspects of communities of physics learners in a particular setting.",Jesper Bruun,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4726,University of Copenhagen,,2012
4725,Symposium Poster,Identities in identity research in science education: What should we study?,"In the present study, I define identity as a type of personhood--the ways in which an individual and surrounding people view the person--that the individual develops as participating in various local, social practices. In science classrooms, students shape their identities along various dimensions, such as identity in relation to the classroom community, science, and racial, ethnic, and linguistic groups. These multiple identities are not independent but often intertwined. An analysis of a-year-long ethnographic study in a high school biology class shows how Korean immigrant students' identities with respect to their immigrant status and language use influence the ways in which they participate in science classroom practices and their participations are perceived. Findings of the study suggest that students' classroom participations and identities in a classroom community should be understood in conjunction with their identities along other social dimensions that are locally constructed.",Minjung Ryu,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4725,"University of Maryland, College Park",,2012
4727,Symposium Poster,Identity and belonging: Are you a physicist (chemist)?,"When science undergraduates begin their upper-division coursework, their declaration of major becomes more concrete and meaningful as they have opportunities to interact more deeply with the community of their chosen discipline. In the process of completing a major, students transition their identity towards being a member of their field. In Wenger's community of practice framework, community membership is built on alignment of common goals, participation in social interactions, and perception of belonging in the community. But what does it mean to be a chemist or physicist from the students' perspective? In this study, we examine junior-level chemistry and physics majors' ideas about their science identity through semi-structured interviews and prompted reflective journals. We compare and contrast how chemistry and physics students negotiate their identity as members in their disciplinary field in terms of practice, qualifications, attitude, and in relation to other STEM communities.",Sissi L.

In this poster, we present implicit scaffolding, a theoretical framework that underlies the design of PhET simulations. This framework is based on the tool-mediated learning theory of Vygotsky and the affordance-constraint theory of Norman, a pioneer in human-computer interaction. While developed in the context of computer simulations, implicit scaffolding also lends itself well to non-computer-based learning tools, such as lab equipment or textbooks. We will demonstrate the use of implicit scaffolding with cases of middle school students building circuits using both a simulation and real equipment. 6th grade students were readily able to build working circuits using both the simulator and real equipment with little to no instructions. Our central claim is that learning tools designed according to implicit scaffolding can ""guide without students feeling guided,"" allowing students to feel a heightened sense of ownership and agency.",Noah Podolefsky,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4707,University of Colorado at Boulder,"Katherine K.

CMPLE is a formative intervention designed to help students and instructors collaborate to change classroom dynamics, based on how closely the environment matches their learning preferences. Analysis of classroom videos, interviews, and other artifacts indicates that adapting the environment to align with the preferences of that shared culture affected the instructor in complex ways. We will trace her teaching practices and her self-described awareness of the culture of learning, to highlight notable changes. The teacher espoused deeper understanding of her students' physics learning experience, which she gained from including students in responding to their own individual and collective learning preferences.",Natan Samuels,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4694,Florida International University,"Eric Brewe, and Laird Kramer

Simultaneously, data were collected at the University of Cape Town in a completely un-related study, also within a large-lecture introductory course, but for understanding how students make sense of measurements in the laboratory.  Trends seen in both of these settings led to an in-depth analysis of the wording used by the instructor to introduce in-class activities or phrase questions to probe student understanding.  We found strong correlations between authoritativeness of statements and a reduction in student engagement in both environments.

4711,Symposium Poster,Modeling Middle Student Learning with Cognitive Developmental Psychology,"Cognitive developmental psychology often seeks to describe students' qualitative understanding of physical phenomena.  In turn, educators can use this research to improve instruction.  Siegler (1981) developed the ""rule assessment"" model for characterizing children's development of multi-factor reasoning.  By conceptualizing a multi-factor domain as a phenomenon comprised of dominant and subordinate factors, this model analyzes students' responses to discern whether their thinking appropriately includes neither factor, only one factor, or the relationship between both factors.  Students' rule levels can then be used in future analyses.  Here, we provide several examples and a demonstration of how we have used this method with middle-school students who learned about torque, projectile motion, and collisions using different instructional methods around simulations.  We show how the technique helps characterize various levels of qualitative reasoning, how these relate to quantitative reasoning, and how the method helps pinpoint the factors students attend to in their reasoning.",Nicole Hallinen,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4711,Stanford University,,2012
4721,Symposium Poster,Obscuring power structures in the physics classroom: Implications for student engagement and physics identity development,"Many students are disempowered in physics classes finding them to be more difficult, unpleasant, narrow, and masculine when compared to other subjects.  Such disempowerment can lead students to limit their engagement and rely on rote learning strategies.  This study explores how physics teachers can help students engage with the material and develop their physics identities by obscuring traditional classroom hierarchies.    Employing a positionality lens on case studies of four high school physics teachers, we coded teachers' behavioral cues that contributed to the relationship structure in the classroom.  Our findings suggest that teachers' physical cues (space and hierarchical stance occupied), structural cues (dynamic nature of the classroom allowing alternating roles), contextual cues (including students' thoughts and experiences), and social cues (obscuring traditional boundaries between teacher and student) affect the social distance between the teacher, students, and content.  This social distance can moderate students' level of engagement and ultimately their physics identity development.",Zahra Hazari,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4721,Clemson University,"Robynne M.

4709,Symposium Poster,Promoting proximal formative assessment with relational discourse,"The practice of proximal formative assessment  the continual, responsive attention to students' developing understanding as it is expressed in real time  depends on students' sharing their ideas with instructors and on teachers' attending to them. Rogerian psychology presents an account of the conditions under which proximal formative assessment may be promoted or inhibited: (1) Normal classroom conditions, characterized by evaluation and attention to learning targets, may present threats to students' sense of their own competence and value, causing them to conceal their ideas and reducing the potential for proximal formative assessment. (2) In contrast, discourse patterns characterized by positive anticipation and attention to learner ideas increase the potential for proximal formative assessment and promote self-directed learning. We present an analysis methodology based on these principles and demonstrate its utility for understanding episodes of university physics instruction.",Rachel Scherr,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4709,Seattle Pacific University,"Hunter G.

Social Network Analysis (SNA) and the more general form, Network Analysis, are a set of representational and quantitative tools that can be used to identify patterns among complex, interconnected data. Thus the methodology is well suited seeking patterns among humans engaged in learning within a disciplinary context as we pursue in PER. Two recent papers in PRST-PER [1,2] reflect the flexibility of NA , drawing on different data types (transcripts and surveys), and addressed very different questions (community and epistemic development).

Case studies of four first-time physics LAs are analyzed to understand the expansion and evolution of their views on good teaching, and their understanding of student learning. Findings suggest that through participating in teaching activities, LAs tend to move toward of view of teaching and learning focused on students construction of physics content, and teaching strategies that are adapted to individual students.  We conclude that the repetition of thinking about how students learn, constructing interventions, and reflecting on the results of their actions leads LAs to converge on certain ways of behaving and talking that are more closely aligned with the goals of the LA program. We hypothesize that pedagogical concepts such as formative assessment and dialogic discourse made available through the pedagogy course assist greatly in students convergence on desired practices.",Kara E.

4646,Symposium Poster,Understanding the Learning Assistant experience with Physics Identity,"Learning Assistants (LAs) have been shown to have better conceptual understanding and more favorable beliefs about science than non-LAs, and are more likely to choose a career in K-12 science teaching (1). We propose that connections between elements of identity, persistence, and participation in an LA program can be explained using the concept of the community of practice and its intimate relationship to identity (2). In separate work, Hazari et al. found that physics identity was highly correlated to expressed career plans in physics (3). We hypothesize that a thriving LA program has many features of a well-functioning community of practice and contributes to all four elements of physics identity: personal interest, student performance, competence, and recognition by others. We explore how this analysis of the LA experience might shape decisions and influence outcomes of adoption and adaptations of the LA model.

I will describe how activity theory can be used to understand efforts to support interactive pedagogy with technologies such as digital cameras, photo sharing websites, and in-class videos of experiments.

Two such sociocultural dimensions are students' immigrant generation and college generation status.

As one of the first LAs for the Applied Mathematics department, a unique perspective is brought to the LA pedagogy course which was initially designed by a physics education researcher and a high school physics teacher. Since the pedagogy course reaches diverse STEM student majors, the course must continually be made relevant for all students. Here we present a unique perspective from two angles: (1) from the angle of a computer science/math major teaching in what was a physics-centric LA pedagogy course and (2) the perspective of a former LA who is now taking action toward educational change.

4702,Symposium Talk,Students' comprehension of a research article adapted for an interdisciplinary high school program,"We present a study of the introduction of Adapted Primary Literature (APL) as part of a high school course on soft matter. APL is a text genre that allows students to comprehend a scientific article, while maintaining the core features of the communication among scientists, thus representing an authentic scientific discourse.  We describe the adaptation of a research paper by Nobel Laureate Paul Flory on phase equilibrium in polymer-solvent systems. The adaptation followed two design strategies: a) Making the interplay between the theory and experimental evidence explicit. b) Re-structuring the text to map the theory onto the students' prior knowledge. Specifically, we map the modeling of polymer-solvent system onto a model for binary mixtures of small molecules that was already studied in class. We then present findings regarding the students' comprehension of the APL and its purpose and discuss their ability to extract features of theoretical modeling embedded in it.",Elon Langbeheim,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4702,Weizmann Institute of Science,"Sam Safran and Edit Yerushalmi

4700,Symposium Talk,Using scientists' notebooks to foster authentic scientific practices,"Scientific Inquiry is an introductory undergraduate course for preservice elementary teachers that aims to engage students in authentic scientific practices where these practices are not viewed as a mere course requirement, but are understood as essential practices for constructing knowledge in the discipline. Many of these practices (e.g., representational practices, control-of-variables) evolve over the course of the semester as we work to answer complex questions. However, we hoped to have students- from the start of the term- keep detailed scientific notebooks. In this presentation, we describe an activity designed to foster practices related to the use of scientific notebooks, detail how we use images from scientists' notebooks, discuss the rubrics students create for their own notebooks, and share outcomes, including images of students' notebooks and students' reactions to the activity.",Leslie J.

4531,Talk Symposium,Finding a Home for All of Myself: Intersectionality in Identity Formation for Women of Color in Physics,"Intersectionality, coined by Kimberle Williams Crenshaw (in law) and pioneered by Patricia Hill Collins (in sociology), posits that minority womens experiences can amount to greater than the sum of racism and sexism (Collins, 1989; Crenshaw, 1989; Wei 1996).  In this symposium, we will present four papers on the application of intersectionality to identity formation for women of color in physics.  Katemari Rosa focuses on the life story of a single woman, as a vehicle for understanding intersectionality in physics identity formation.  Angela Johnson and Heidi Carlone will apply their authoring science identity model to physics, illustrating intersectionality as an analytical tool.  Lily Ko and Maria (Mia) Ong analyzed intersectionality in the lives of 23 women of color in physics and physics-related fields.  Rachel Kachchaf, Apriel Hodari and Lorelle Espinosa discuss how these collective works inform politics and policy in the current STEM-focused education policy context.",Apriel K Hodari,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4531,Council for Opportunity in Education,,2012
4502,Talk Symposium,Reading of scientific texts as means of exposing students to authentic disciplinary practices,"How to bridge the dynamics of scientific discoveries with teaching in an introductory physics classroom is a long standing challenge. In chemistry and biology the incorporation of scientific articles in the high school curriculum is a subject of recent inquiry and interest, whose goal is to expose students to authentic scientific processes and facilitate their enculturation into the discipline. However, such scientific texts are hardly ever included as part of introductory physics courses. This session presents examples of how physics instruction can integrate readings of scientific texts at the introductory level. The readings discussed here encompass contemporary research papers adapted to the introductory level, historical lab-notebooks and popular scientific articles of famous scientists, and computational codes. The session and the related discussion aim to scrutinize the instructional affordances of various types of scientific texts, the adaptation and instructional use of each kind, and the learning that takes place.",Shulamit Kapon,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4502,"School of Education, Tel Aviv University","Edit Yerushalmi

4657,Workshop,"Beyond the physics classroom: Exploring disciplinary factors that influence students reasoning about approximation, through video data","Physics students are not only taking physics. When examining how students reason with concepts and tools in physics, it is productive to consider their reasoning and experiences with those same concepts and tools in other disciplines. An ongoing interdisciplinary research program is investigating students reasoning about approximation, and the perceived discipline- and context-dependent factors that influence their choice and evaluation of different approximation practices.  Interviewed students reasoned through a number of approximation problems designed to cue experiences from either math or physics.

In this workshop session, participants will collaboratively explore students orientations to Taylor series approximation through video interview data. The session will be grounded in the exploration of the many different ways that student strategies and approximation practices are tied to the disciplinary commitments that they perceive in physics and mathematics contexts, and how those perceptions drive students engagement in and reflection on the practice of approximating, in general.",Danielle Champney,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4657,"University of California, Berkeley","Eric Kuo; University of Maryland, College Park",2012
4659,Workshop,Identifying identity: Using video analysis to track the dynamics of students' identities in the learning of physics,"This workshop concerns analytical and methodological challenges related to studying identity in physics learning. Identity encompasses macro-level categorizations (e.g., gender, ethnicity, academic major, etc.) as well as micro-level dynamics in face-to-face interactions. Here, we use video analysis to explore the intersection of macro/micro notions of identity, as they play out moment-to-moment in physics learning. We will consider the following questions: How do we identify and characterize markers of identity in video data?  How do we bound salient moments where students' identities are influencing their interactions and vice versa?  How do we empirically support claims pertaining to the role of identity in learning?  We will approach these questions through collaborative viewing and analysis of video from classrooms and interviews. We begin with a large group discussion, followed by breakout sessions where participants work in small groups to analyze clips provided by collaborating researchers currently studying issues of identity in physics learning.",Luke Conlin,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4659,Tufts University,"Lama Jaber, Tufts University

4668,Workshop,Supporting and Sustaining the Holistic Development of Students into Practicing Physicists,"This workshop expects to leverage the broad expertise inherent in the PERC community to begin structuring a research agenda which might guide future efforts to support the holistic development of students into practicing physicists.  Participants will brainstorm the following questions in small groups and synthesize the results as a whole group.  Conclusions will be summarized for the community in a proceedings paper.
1) What concepts, habits of mind, skills, and representations thread through the sub-disciplines of upper-division physics?
2) What are the characteristics of curricula that scaffold student acquisition of these concepts, habits of mind, skills, and representations throughout the upper-division?
3) What aspects of institutional culture might facilitate the development, support, and sustainability of these curricula?
4) What models of research are currently available to address the questions above and where are new models needed?",Corinne A. Manogue,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4668,Oregon State University,"Mary Bridget Kustusch, Oregon State University

4575,Workshop,Video Analysis Workshop: Reconciling cognitivist and interaction analysis methodologies,"Within learning sciences, tensions sometimes arise between researchers espousing cognitivist versus interactionist perspectives. Broadly speaking, the cognitivist perspective conceptualizes learning as changes in the form and content of knowledge in the head. The interactionist perspective, on the other hand, conceives of learning as a social phenomenon, embodied in the learners talk, action, and interaction with other living participants and materials in a setting. This workshop is aimed toward the goal of seeking reconciliation between the perspectives. We will show two video clips, excerpts from video-taped problem solving done during a (i) clinical interview and a (ii) classroom small-group discussion. During the first half of the workshop, participants will unpack the phenomena observed in the videos. We expect that as a result of this observational emphasis, the participants, to varying degrees, will attend to the content of students knowledge as well as to features in the interaction that become salient to the activity, including affect and situational identity. The second half of the workshop will be used for sharing and synthesizing analysis and comments, and reflecting on whether and how such close analysis of unfolding activity draws on and contributes to both perspectives.",Ayush Gupta,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2012/detail.cfm?ID=4575,"University of Maryland, College Park","Reed Stevens, Northwestern University
