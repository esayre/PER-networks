6598,Contributed Poster Presentation,"""Collectively, we're a genius"": Teachers discussing student difficulties*","In a teacher professional development meeting, teachers were asked a question about potential energy and then to discuss why students might give a particular response to it. Working together in a large group, they came up with a rich, nuanced description of student reasoning, touching on multiple ways of thinking about energy, and how these might affect student responses. As PD organizers, we (the authors) had predicted 3 or 4 different explanations of the most common incorrect answer. Teachers came up with several more. Their answers included ideas in the literature (related to time, effort, and work, for example) and ideas not in the literature (such as a wonderfully compelling reverse deficit model of energy). We find that bringing teachers together and sharing student data within a facilitated community lets teachers arrive at surprising insights about how their students think about energy.

6570,Contributed Poster Presentation,"""Nothing works the first time"": An experimental physics epistemology","The ability to troubleshoot is an important learning outcome for undergraduate physics laboratory courses. To better understand the role of troubleshooting in Electronics laboratory courses, we interviewed 20 Electronics instructors from multiple institution types about their beliefs and teaching practices related to troubleshooting. In these interviews, instructors articulated the idea that ""nothing works the first"" in multiple contexts pertaining to troubleshooting. We show how this idea informs instructors' perceptions of (1) the importance of developing students' ability to troubleshoot, (2) what it means for students to be proficient troubleshooters, and (3) the need (or lack thereof) to specifically design laboratory activities that engage students in the troubleshooting process. Moreover, we argue that this idea is connected to an experimental physics epistemology: newly built experimental systems do not initially function as expected, i.e., ""nothing works the first time."" We discuss implications for instruction and assessment of troubleshooting in Electronics courses.",Dimitri R.

6686,Contributed Poster Presentation,A Cross-sectional Study of Students Use of Mathematics,"Upper-division physics courses introduce quantitative models that require students to use sophisticated mathematical tools to develop an understanding of them. We have investigated students' in-the-moment math reasoning during physics problem solving, through observations in dyad interviews.  By conducting interviews over a range of students physics experience, we enabled a cross-sectional analysis of how students employ mathematical tools, particularly the decomposition of vectors. In investigating students reasoning underlying their use of those mathematical tools, we have catalogued student difficulties and identified productive approaches for pedagogical purposes. We observed some patterns in students problem solving approaches and difficulties that propagate and/or evolve across levels. For example, introductory students may neglect to consider the sign a vector component while upper-level students are much more thorough in their analysis. However, we observe sign errors in work by both groups, but with different reasoning.",Anna Turnbull,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6686,"Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824","Leanne Doughty [1] and Marcos D.

Traditional laboratory courses often use formal lab reports to educate students about the process of scientific writing, yet this process deprives the writer of an authentic audience for their work and limits opportunities to write in their authentic style.  Our research focuses on a different approach to scientific writing called Letters Home, which requires students to write a letter about their lab activities to a recipient outside of the laboratory course, first to a non-physicist and later to a professional physicist.  Through this process, students practice skills such as gathering, analyzing, and reporting data while expanding their conceptual understanding and experimental skills.

The homeworks were designed to elicit detailed responses and sense-making. Students completed the CLASS prior to the start of the course. Student responses on the first two homeworks of the semester were coded for instances of evidence of sense-making, such as checking if an answer is reasonable and providing multiple explanations. We had matched CLASS responses and homeworks for 26 students. 
Our results show that evidence of sense-making on the homework assignments is essentially uncorrelated with percent favorable score on the CLASS and weakly correlated with percent unfavorable score. These results suggest that students formal beliefs about physics, as measured by the CLASS, may be only weakly related to how students engage in solving physics problems and indicate that further study is needed.",Gabriel Rowe,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6678,Clark University,"Anna McLean Phillips, Tufts University",2016

The study was conducted in a large enrollment physics class for future elementary teachers at a Midwestern land grant university.

Problem contexts usually extended beyond theory and mathematics (e.g., experiments, data analysis, and computation). Important and difficult contexts blended soft and technical skills (e.g., communication and collaboration). Routine problem activities tended to be well-defined (e.g., troubleshooting) while difficult and important ones were more open-ended and had multiple solution paths (e.g., evaluating options). The results can inform curriculum development and PER with an expanded view of problem-solving.",Benjamin Zwickl,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6617,Rochester Institute of Technology,"Jarrett Vosburg, Anne Leak, Kelly Norris Martin, Javier Olivera",2016
6565,Contributed Poster Presentation,Classroom Instruction Promotes Posterior Medial Cortex Brain Activity During Problem-Solving,"Understanding of physics-related concepts is often quantified through physics problem-solving (PPS) assessments. However, no study has characterized neurobiological processes underlying PPS or skill development via classroom instruction. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to delineate PPS brain networks and probe differences resulting from classroom instruction. 15 students underwent pre- and identical post-instruction PPS fMRI sessions. We assessed brain activity and identified regions more engaged post- relative to pre-instruction (P<0.05). Data revealed consistent fronto-parietal networks contributing to PPS. Moreover, significantly increased post-instruction fMRI activity in posterior medial cortex (PMC), accompanied by improved PPS scores, implicated this regions critical role in skill development. As PMC supports spatial memory and attentional focus [1,2], these novel neurobiological observations provide insight into how education experience may augment brain activity which, in turn, contributes to enhanced PPS skills.

These field experiences took place in the unique classroom contexts of STEM-focused academies within traditional public K-12 schools.  One of these academies was a project-based engineering academy with an integrated physics, visual arts/design, and engineering curriculum.  The other academy included separate courses in physics and engineering that focused on environmental issues.  In this study, I investigated how undergraduate physics majors participated in the two academy contexts.  I specifically examined their opportunities to observe and participate in high-leverage science teaching practices and how their visions of effective science teaching changed after participating.

Cognitive wrappers, utilized here in an introductory physics for the life sciences (IPLS) course, ask students to reflect on the following: 1) the amount of time they invested in preparing for an exam, 2) the root causes of errors made on the exam, 3) study habits that students feel positively impacted their preparation, and 4) strategies that students are willing to implement to improve their performance.   Students also have the opportunity to provide suggestions to the instructor that they think will help improve their learning.  In this work we report on the study habits that students employ to prepare for a physics exam, self-reported root-causes of mistakes on exams, and strategies that students are willing to try to improve their performance.

Many students incorrectly assume there must be dependence between the axes of any graph irrespective of whether the data suggests a relation. Additionally, students have difficulty with variables and their role in the experiment. A majority of the errors are consistent with failure to control variables or illogical reasoning from the data. We developed and tested two different one-hour group activities to improve student understanding. One activity was laboratory based and focused on control of variables and experimentation. The other was recitation based and focused on logical reasoning and data manipulation. Both activities improved student ability to draw conclusions and answer questions about the data in graph or picture form.

We conducted semi-structured interviews with ten graduate students to determine problem-solving strategies they found useful in their research. We coded these interviews using emergent and grounded theory approaches. Our findings explore problem-solving strategies (e.g., planning ahead, breaking down problems, evaluating options), contexts (e.g., designing software and troubleshooting equipment), and characteristics of successful problem-solvers (e.g., initiative, persistence, and motivation). Graduate students also relied on representations such as test cases, approximations, and simulations in their problem-solving process.

Using statistical analysis of tens of thousands of student course grades across six years, we find that the UC Davis Collaborative Learning through Active Sense-making in Physics (CLASP) style interactive engagement course is associated with decreased failure rates. In the traditional lecture format course, which the CLASP course replaced, failure rates vary widely between ethnicity groups. While the failure rates in the CLASP course are smaller for all ethnicities, other measures of student outcomes remained unchanged or improved(1).

6508,Contributed Poster Presentation,Developing a Competency Based Introductory College Physics Curriculum for Non-Physics Majors,"The discipline of physics integrates skills in understanding and using the laws of nature. Cross-cutting skills include abstraction, modeling, critical thinking, and communication. Context specific skills include applied mathematics and experimental skills like gathering accurate data. These skills are trans-disciplinary and are useful outside the domain of physics. Standard practices of physics instruction do not intentionally monitor or evaluate these skills. This undermines the relevance and value of physics to the learners.
 
Using a competency-based learning experience model, the skills (competencies) are clearly defined and evaluated. Learners aim to achieve competencies throughout the learning process. The achieved competencies are reported to an external evaluator as artifacts toward competency badges. This approach to learning encourages learners to take ownership of the process. Also, it communicates directly with the learner about the values of a particular learning experience, and, with an external evaluator of the values of a learner.",Ajith Rajapaksha,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6508,"Purdue University, Purdue Polytechnic Instititute, Transdisciplinary Studies","Jeffrey John Evans

One problem involved the quadratic formula, requiring students to select one answer and disregard the other as inappropriate.  Many students incorrectly reported both answers; no control students reported only one quadratic solution.  Providing either scaffold helped students to report only one value (p < 0.01).

In interviews, when students are prompted to examine the extreme cases of a scenario they've been analyzing, they shift towards an epistemic frame of seeking coherence between physical intuition and mathematical formalisms. At the same time, they generalize their conclusions about extreme cases to the general case and recast extreme-case reasoning from an evaluative tool (e.g. Is this answer correct?) to a generative one (e.g. What form could the correct answer possibly take?).

Using an activity theoretic framework, we analyze video data from the interactions in the small groups during afterschool sessions. Youth participants are the subjects of the activity theory analysis, foregrounding their experiences and objectives for participation. In this paper, we focus on one group of seventh grade girls and the challenges they have to engagement.

6673,Contributed Poster Presentation,Examining the relationship between Career Outcome Expectations and Physic Identity,"Previous studies about career outcome expectations, or what students hope to achieve in their careers, have revealed strong relationships between outcome expectations and STEM career choice. Drawing from a US national survey with responses from 15,847 students in mandatory College English courses (Outreach Programs and Science Career Intentions, NSF \# 1161052), we examined the relationship between students outcome expectations and physics identity.  It has previously been found that students with certain outcome expectations are more likely to develop a physics identity.  Expanding beyond prior work, we focus on how outcome expectations are related to physics identity for students grouped by: (i) medical and engineering career aspirations, and (ii) female and male self-identification.  The results provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between outcome expectations and physics identity for different students.",Camila Monsalve,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6673,Florida International University,"Zahra Hazari, Daryl McPadden, Gerhard Sonnert and Philip M.

To further improve the tutorial sessions, we studied how often students reach an Optimal Learning Moment during them.
At an optimal learning moment a student experiences balanced and high levels of challenge, interest and skill at the same time. These experiences were recorded in situ using an adaptation of Csikszentmihalyis Experience Sampling Method.
The Experience Sampling Method proved to be a practical way to collect data on students feelings during tutorial sessions. We investigate possible correlations between frequency of optimal learning moments, course performance and results from conceptual and attitudinal surveys (MBT, CSEM, CLASS) to find out how worthwhile it is to pursue optimal learning moments.",Ilkka Hendolin,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6524,"University of Helsinki, Department of Physics",,2016

These concepts provide the foundations for future learning, and so a strong conceptual acuity is important for success as an undergraduate.  This study investigates student understanding of basic concepts from cosmology in three different first- and second-year Astronomy courses at the University of St Andrews.  We have collected and analyzed quantitative (student surveys) and qualitative data (student interviews), and compare results with a previously-published study at a different institution.  The outcomes demonstrate that certain alternative conceptions were more prevalent among students at St Andrews than in the previous study; and that students had particular difficulty interpreting graphical representations of an expanding universe.",Charles Baily,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6577,University of St Andrews,Amelia Sandbach and Anne-Marie Weijmans,2016

The CLASS developers found overwhelming agreement among physics experts on most, but not all, of the surveys 42 statements. However, at the introductory student level, previous studies have acknowledged differences by gender, with male students aligning their personal views more similarly to the expert view while female students more accurately identify what experts believe than males. While some prior research has explored the development of physics expertise via CLASS, it has not explored this development separately for men and women. Our work addresses two questions: do male and female experts agree about CLASS items? If so, at what point does the gap close?

6543,Contributed Poster Presentation,Exploring the relationship between exam performance and lecture/recitation attendance,"We have examined the relationship between attendance and exam performance in large enrollment introductory mechanics courses dominated by first-year engineering students. There is a very strong correlation between exam performance and recitation attendance. Recitations engage students in active learning to solve a multipart problems that emphasizes essential concepts. Clicker questions begin and end each recitation. A similar trend is observed for lectures. These correlations are observed for two classes, one very large (1600 students) on a residential campus, and one smaller (150 students) on a commuter campus. We have also examined the nature of this correlation as a function of SAT/ACT scores, gender, and national origin of students.

Psychometric theory tells us that it is essential for inventory developers to establish the fairness of an instrument for any population for which it is intended.  Many physics courses are strongly gender-imbalanced, which can obscure gender effects when field-testing items for appropriateness. In a preliminary analysis that disaggregated by gender, we found that many items might be discarded from the FCI for falling outside acceptable ranges of item difficulty or discrimination. This result is almost entirely buried when the tests are only run on the overall (male-dominated) sample. Here we extend the analysis to a larger data set and progress to additional psychometric tests, attending to other buried gender effects that may appear.",Alexis Papak,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6688,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Purdue University,"Adrienne Traxler, Department of Physics, Wright State University

Eight faculty from Oregon State University were interviewed to better understand how they think about and teach dimensional analysis. These faculty teach introductory, upper division and graduate courses, and have diverse research backgrounds. Dimensional analysis was identified as either a tool for deriving formulas or answer checking, some preferred to think of the latter mode as unit checking. Students are expected to be able to check units/dimensions at all levels (introductory through graduate) of their physics education.

(2006, 2012) proposed that transfer is fostered in classrooms that expansively frame students activity: situating students' work in a broader context that transcends the moment-to-moment activity in the classroom. Such expansive framing, it is argued, promotes intercontextuality (IC) which ""fosters transfer between the linked learning and transfer contexts. This poster builds on this vein of research. In particular, we examine what kinds of intercontextuality exist in a science class (Atkins & Salter, 2015) that exhibits high measures on one survey of transfer (Pugh, 2011). We argue that IC in which students link the scientific substance of classroom activity with their everyday lives may be particularly rich for fostering TE in particular, and transfer more generally.",Leslie Atkins Elliott,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6612,Boise State University,,2016

Centrality measures were determined from data obtained from a survey style questionnaire in which students were asked to list the names of their study partners within the class. Networks were then analyzed in aggregate and by gender to look for gender effects in network participation. These effects might take the form of different patterns of centrality, or a bias toward student groups self-selecting by gender.

6665,Contributed Poster Presentation,Graduate teaching assistants use different criteria when grading introductory physics vs. quantum mechanics problems,"Physics teaching assistants (TAs) are often responsible for grading in courses at all levels. Since grading communicates instructors expectations, TAs grading practices play a crucial role in shaping students approaches to problem solving. However, TAs may have a vast array of beliefs about learning and problem solving that may impact how they grade student solutions in introductory and advanced physics courses. To investigate possible discrepancies in TAs beliefs and practices related to grading in courses at different levels, we implemented a sequence of instructional activities in a TA professional development course which asked TAs to grade student solutions of introductory physics and upper-level quantum mechanics problems and explain why, if at all, their grading approaches were different or similar in the two contexts. We find that there are clear differences in these two contexts and a majority of the TAs are significantly more strict in grading in quantum mechanics. Unlike the introductory physics context, in quantum mechanics, they penalize students for not explicating the problem solving process. Differences in TAs grading approaches and reasons for the differences in the two contexts based upon individual interviews, class discussions and written responses will be discussed. The findings of this study have implication for the professional development of TAs.",Charles Henderson,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6665,Western Michigan University,"Emily Marshman, University of Pittsburgh

As part of a larger collaborative project, we have been designing and implementing tasks to assess the extent to which introductory physics students are able to logically follow and evaluate hypothetical student reasoning chains in a variety of physics contexts. In some tasks, students are asked to infer the conclusions that would be drawn from different lines of reasoning articulated by hypothetical students. In other tasks, students are asked to rank, according to relative clarity, three different chains of reasoning articulated by hypothetical students. We will describe the development of these tasks and share preliminary results.",William N. Ferm Jr.,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6579,Presenter,"J. Caleb Speirs, MacKenzie R.

In this work, we focus on the learning gains of visually impaired students, an undergraduate and recent graduate, after using the simulation, Capacitor Lab: Basics. Comparing pre and post-interview answers to questions about capacitance and circuits, our results show that after using the simulation both learners understood the relationship between plate separation, area, and capacitance. Additionally, while only one learner connected the charged capacitor to the light bulb in the simulation, both answered that the light bulb will be illuminated in post-questions. These learning gains indicate that visually impaired students can master the learning goals of Capacitor Lab: Basics once they can access and perceive of its elements.

These biasing networks are critical for signal processing via transistor circuits, yet the coverage of such networks in both courses and texts is typically sparse and frequently secondary to coverage of the amplifier circuits themselves.  In this cross-disciplinary project, we have been examining the extent to which students are able to correctly predict the behavior of the biasing network under both dc and ac conditions.  Specific examples of student work are used to highlight the most prevalent conceptual and reasoning difficulties identified.  Implications for instruction emerging from this investigation will also be discussed.

Incorrect answers indicated both a lack of conceptual understanding and a failure to apply even lower order thinking skills in problem solving. While correct answers did indicate evidence of at least lower level thinking skills (coded by a rubric based on Blooms taxonomy), incorrect and partially correct answers showed very little evidence of the use of critical thinking skills. Interviews of a subset of these students were consistent with the results of the written responses. The results suggest that in classes that routinely employ assessment instruments that do not explicitly require evidence of thinking skills, students may not develop those skills.",Beth Thacker,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6637,Texas Tech University,,2016

The most general form of a physical law is independent of a specific coordinate system. In order to apply these laws to a particular physical situation, these equations must be specified in a coordinate system that is appropriate to the situation. We posed two problems to middle division physics students in individual problem solving interviews that required the students to turn a coordinate independent integral expression into a coordinate dependent equation that can be integrated.

Still, many of them continue to use the idea that coldness transfers. Past researchers have identified that cold is commonly perceived as a separate heat energy. Nevertheless, we have not found specific activities to address this idea. We present the analysis of a collaborative session among K-12 teachers who were trying to analyze how to address coldness in the classroom. During the sessions, teachers got to model the energy in different scenarios, including an object in room temperature interacting with snow.

I describe an implementation of the Cooperative Problem-Solving Model (Heller & Heller 2010) for over 500 students in an Introductory Mechanics course for Life Science Majors at UC San Diego, aimed at improving problem-solving, relevance and student collaboration in learning. I describe our flipped-model approach with 25 hours of video lectures, problem-solving skill development through training worksheets and strategy scaffolds, and bi-weekly team projects combining physical and life science problems. Nine sections of this course were conducted alongside a large lecture ""control"", all taught by the same instructor. I show comparisons in student performance on exams, FCI and CLASS; and anecdotal evidence indicating increased relevance and collaboration. I also examine how video usage impacted learning.",Adam Burgasser,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6672,UC San Diego,"Mike Lopez (UC San Diego), Isabela Rodrigues (Instituto Federal de Educa��o, Ci�ncia e Tecnologia do Rio de Janeiro), Jordan Campbell (UC San Diego)",2016
6634,Contributed Poster Presentation,Role of Group Dynamics in Analysis of Attitudes towards Metacognitive Physics Problem Solving,"Current investigations into pedagogical goals of introductory algebra-based physics students at the University of Central Arkansas, by choice of major and by learning orientation towards an in-class metacognitive group problem solving task, seek to determine possible relationships with attitudinal shifts and course performance. Students thus far have been untreated with known group-based learning pedagogies, so as to establish trends of common group habits, and ultimately to properly inform implementation of group-based pedagogies in reaction to these trends. We present initial analysis of group dynamics observed thus far during the problem solving task, in consideration of chosen strategies, determined learning orientations, and attitudinal shifts. In addition, current results will require further information from group dynamics in future research. A proposal for future analysis of more complete audiovisual data, in order to examine evolution of lab group dynamics during a given class period, will be discussed as informed by current results.",Andrew J.

Most researched strategies are categorized under ""active learning"", or they seek to relate the content to the students' lives. Develop curriculum that acts directly to engage students by involving them in deciding what is studied and how. We implement a version of Standards-Based Grading that we call Competency-Based Assessment. We define the competencies and invite students to collaborate in deciding how the competencies are assessed, e.g. exams or projects, and allowing for reassessments. The next step involves students and teacher together defining the competencies. An informal survey from this semester shows indifferent to positive response from students in areas of exam content clarity and ability to retest competencies.

Previous research has pointed to a conflation of the energy and wavefunction axes as leading to common student difficulties in understanding phenomena such as tunneling. The existence of this difficulty has influenced QMCS survey items and design choices in several PhET simulations. We add to this research by investigating how students use and interact with this graphical representation while sense-making. Through fine-timescale analysis of video data from clinical interviews with engineering majors in a modern physics course, we document that the inscription can play both communicative and generative roles in the student's reasoning.

One section was divided into six groups of 4-5 students each.  Each group created a solution to the same problem on a 2x 3 whiteboard.  The groups then formed a large circle in the center of the classroom with their whiteboards resting against their knees facing in to the rest of the group.  The instructor was outside the circle and interjected rarely.  

Examples are given of conversations where students did and did not overcome sharp disagreements to eventually reach whole-class consensus.  We examine how social positioning contributed to students either successfully examining and resolving different ideas or failing to do so.

This skill becomes particularly important when learning Electricity and Magnetism, where the most appropriate coordinate system will often depend on the geometry and symmetry of a problem. This study aims to understand how students think about coordinate systems and unit vectors in non-Cartesian coordinate systems.  In this paper we look at student understanding of unit vectors in plane polar coordinates in terms of a resources model [Hammer 2000]. Data were collected in the form of written responses and interviews in upper division physics courses at two universities. After deeper analysis we found that students are activating several resources and using them in ways that can be productive and unproductive.

In one task, students constructed differential length and volume elements for an unconventional spherical coordinate system. Here we describe one aspect of this study, which involves identifying the symbolic forms (Sherin, 2001) students invoked when building or checking these vector expressions. For example, the parts-of-a-whole form was particularly useful to students, allowing them to carve out the specific component structure of the needed vector differential length. Students also used the dependence form to account for dimensionality during construction of each component. Further analysis addresses the role of these symbolic forms in student performance on the task.",Benjamin Schermerhorn,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6518,University of Maine,John Thompson,2016

The site was used primarily to facilitate student-student communications, although the instructor also used it on some occasions to distribute information to the class. We also used WebAssign as a homework system, and extracted data on student activities in that system as well. In this paper, we describe a study of the connections among students efforts and outcomes as measured by CN and WebAssign.

Different alternate conceptions were found, including charge attribution to the magnet poles and mechanics-related arguments. This was not a linear study; however, participants were engineering students with several majors in the three groups.

Researchers on both sides adhere to a priori commitments, rather than empirical data of learners and scientists explanations.  This poster presents a microgenetic analysis of 20 interviews with both novices and experts as they spontaneously constructed explanations of the behavior of Newtons cradle.  Analysis reveals that (1) experts and novices alike used teleological reasoning, and productively so, as a placeholder (Carey, 2004) for a mechanistic account, and (2) the difference between experts and novices was not in which mode of reasoning they used, but in how explicitly they coordinated both perspectives.

In this study, we have investigated the effects of this redesign on success and withdrawal rates, student conceptual learning as measured by Force Concept Inventory (FCI), and student attitudes as measured by Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS). We have found a significant increase in FCI gains with redesigned labs and improvements in CLASS favorable scores for Conceptual Understanding and Sense Making/Effort categories. We also report the result of a characterization of the inquiry level of old and new experiments using a newly developed rubric.",Zeynep Topdemir,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6589,Georgia State University,"David N.

These goals are primarily obtained through a summer bridge program and mentoring program. The summer program promotes a sense of community while engaging students with a strong STEM foundation, built around a central theme. The mentoring program pairs incoming freshman with an upperclassman or graduate student mentor to help them adjust to college life and introduce them to the nature of research. Other Sundial activities include: workshops on equity, diversity and professional development, casual science events, and research conferences. In this poster, we present a description of Sundial activities and outcomes: Freshman involved in Sundial activities reported greater connectivity with their peers and more confidence in their ability to succeed. Further, Sundial membership includes 25% more women and 21% more underrepresented minorities than the general physics population",Kali Johnson,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6687,Arizona State University,"Alex Brimhall, Dr. Anna Zaniewski",2016

Their grading practices can help communicate instructors expectations to students and play a crucial role in shaping students approaches to problem solving and learning. Physics education researchers recommend grading practices that place the burden of proof for showing evidence of understanding on students. However, without guidance and support, TAs may have undesirable beliefs regarding grading and undesirable grading practices. The purpose of this study is to investigate how TAs apply a carefully designed grading rubric that appropriately weights the problem-solving process and whether use of the rubric supports the development of desirable grading practices that place the burden of proof on the student.",Edit Yerushalmi,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6516,"Department of Science Teaching, Weizmann Institute of Science","Ryan Sayer, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Pittsburgh

However, students can struggle with this transition to open-ended work, particularly if there isnt explicit discussion of expectations.  For the past three years, I have used the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS) to monitor how an advanced lab course with a significant student-driven project impacts student attitudes about experimental work. During that time period, I have increased the use of metacognitive activities that ask students to reflect on their approaches to making decisions and handling problems they encounter in the lab. Here I report on the correlation between the introduction of metacognitive prompts and changes in some responses on the E-CLASS survey, as well as providing a qualitative overview of the students metacognitive reflections.",Melissa Eblen-Zayas,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6560,Carleton College,,2016

6500,Contributed Poster Presentation,The impact of students epistemological framing on a task requiring representational consistency*,"The ability to flexibly transform between different representations (e.g., from mathematical to graphical representations) of the same concept is a hallmark of expertise. This ability is often lacking in many introductory students as evidenced by the lack of consistency in students representations (i.e., students construct two representations for the same concept in the same situation that are not consistent with one another). In this study, we asked students to construct two representations for the electric field for a situation involving spherical symmetry (charged conducting sphere surrounded by charged conducting spherical shell). This type of problem has been found to result in many students constructing representations that are not consistent with one another. Here, we present findings from individual interviews with students which suggest that students lack of consistency may partly be attributed to the type of knowledge that the graphical and mathematical contexts trigger. Using the epistemic games framework terminology, the two representations students are asked to construct (mathematical vs. graphical) may lead them to play two different epistemic games. We discuss how students epistemological framing may contribute to their lack of representational consistency.

While we have found that the inclusion of topical examples of relevance to life-science students can help to engage students whose initial interest in physics is less developed, we have found that the inclusion of biological content is just one of several dimensions supporting student engagement in IPLS. When describing what is salient to them about their IPLS experiences, students are just as quick to cite particular pedagogical structures and supports as they are to cite issues relating directly to content choices. In this poster we begin to unpack this complex interplay of content and pedagogy in fostering student engagement in the IPLS classroom.

Two well-known sets of physics tutorials, the Tutorials in Introductory Physics (TIP) and Open Source Tutorials (OST), are reported to emerge from distinct conceptual change strategies.  For example, TIP is often associated with elicit-confront-resolve, while OST is connected with refining intuitions.  Based on the analysis of interviews with tutorial authors and of the tutorials themselves, we identify a pattern that is common to both sets of tutorials, which we call the revisiting strategy: students are asked to return to a problem they have already examined.  Elicit-confront-resolve and refining intuitions can both be examples of revisiting, suggesting that revisiting is an important and general technique that illuminates the similarity between the two sets of tutorials.",Joshua Von Korff,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6611,Georgia State University,"Amin Bayat Barooni, Georgia State University

Because the course is offered only every other year, we are uniquely situated to compare the experiences of those students who take the IPLS course to a similar set of students who take a traditional first-semester introductory physics course that covers the same topics but does not foreground biological connections. In this talk we draw on conceptual and attitudinal survey data, as well as a series of case-study interviews, to describe the conceptual, epistemological, and affective differences that we observe between the two student populations. We identify the features of the IPLS experience that were most salient to students, and suggest how particular course structures may have been especially important in supporting students ability to do well in the IPLS environment.",Max Franklin,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6684,Swarthmore College,"Haley Gerardi, Swarthmore College

We work to develop a framework that combines Hazaris (2009) physics identity work and Nasirs (2011) racialized identity work, in order to understand how identity in physics is impacted by cultural and racial identities. In particular we focus on two dimensions of the combined framework: relational resources (from Nasir), which are the relationships that encourage or discourage participation in the field, and recognition (from Hazari), which is the acknowledgement of being a physics student by oneself or others. We operationalize these concepts by analyzing interviews with physicists at the graduate student level and beyond. In this paper, we demonstrate that the constructs of recognition and relational resources overlap through the careful examination of the experiences of two physicists, one who is a black woman and one who is a white man.

Informal programs have a variety of goals and a wide range of content, audiences, facilitators, and medium. However, research is lacking as to what makes individual university informal physics programs successful. In this work, we seek to understand the practices of informal physics programs and how they are situated in their local physics community by examining two large informal physics programs in Colorado. Using management and organizational theory, we analyze interviews with facilitators and document institutional structure and cultural practices within each program. Themes from the analysis are importance of sustained funding, cultural norms of the institution in which the program is embedded, faculty support, and a consistent pool of volunteers.

We use this theory to investigate the factors that contribute to physics students decisions to participate in informal science programs. We conducted interviews with university students that volunteered in an afterschool physics program for K-8 students. Interviews were analyzed using content analysis. Findings indicate that previous participation in informal activities, attitudes towards engaging with the community, and recognition from peers are common themes in university students initial reasons for involvement.

6587,Contributed Poster Presentation,Using contrasting cases to develop student metacognitive knowledge about salient distracting features in physics problems,"Student reasoning on physics problems is often context dependent. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that salient distracting features (SDFs) in physics problems may cue students spontaneous reasoning.  This cued reasoning is typically accepted without question, even though it may be unproductive and may preclude the use of relevant knowledge.  Research suggests that strengthening students metacognition may help address these difficulties. The present study employs contrasting cases to develop student metacognitive knowledge (MK) about reflecting on why and how SDFs can influence thinking when answering physics problems.  In this investigation, the learning of the MK was compared under two conditions: (1) synthesizing contrasting cases and (2) processing contrasting cases separately.  Results indicated that synthesizing sets helped students to recognize and apply the MK more effectively than processing sets individually. The findings suggest that the synthesis of contrasting cases may be an effective approach to helping students build relevant MK.",Thanh K.

6627,Contributed Poster Presentation,Utility of the Cognitive Reflection Test in research on student reasoning in physics*,"Research suggests that even after physics instruction designed to address specific difficulties, many students struggle to analyze unfamiliar situations. We hypothesize that some students possess the necessary conceptual understanding, but fail to recognize the applicability of their knowledge due to the strong activation of informal reasoning pathways. In order to disentangle students conceptual understanding from their reasoning approaches, we have employed a paired-question methodology in which screening and target questions require the application of the same concepts and skills, but yield inconsistent responses. Our findings align with the dual-process theory of cognition, in which learners often respond based on a first reaction or gut feeling, instead of formal knowledge and skills. In order to probe the robustness of our hypothesis further, we have explored the utility of the Cognitive Reflection Test in gauging the extent to which students reflection abilities impact their performance in physics.

We coded participant responses for the presence of classroom and intuitive knowledge, noting when one or the other was privileged in reasoning to or justifying a prediction.  Though this is a low n study, our analysis suggests the classroom framing of science students inhibits use of non-classroom or intuitive knowledge even in situations when it is useful.

But, as someone who taught medical students at UIUC before moving to Purdue, I soon concluded that all I could get out of statistical methods was evidence of a new disease. It was never going to give me what I wanted, which was a cure. I.e., a way to overcome some of the challenges of teaching and learning chemistry. So about 30 years ago, my group started to focus in qualitative techniques. It soon became apparent that much of our early work was not based on clear, concisely worded research questions. Nor did it build on a strong theoretical framework that would guide the way choices of methodology are made. (To be honest, neither did a lot of other DBER studies at the time!) Fortunately, I was surrounded by bright graduate students who were willing to help guide me in my search for a better way to approach such interesting questions as whether our model of what successful students did when working on quantitative problems they encountered in the introductory chemistry course would have any resemblance to the model of successful problem solving both undergraduate and graduate students used when working on non-quantitative problems such as predicting the product of a chemical reaction or deducing the structure of a compound from FT NMR and FT IR spectra. My goal in this paper is to provide a glance at some of what we learned as a result of bringing qualitative research into the CER community. And to explain why we eventually published a book with the title: Theoretical Frameworks for Research in Chemistry/Science Education.",George Bodner,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6670,Purdue University,,2016
6481,Poster Symposium,Expanding Research Questions by Expanding Quantitative Methodologies,"This poster symposium will highlight multiple quantitative methodologies that can allow physics education researchers to expand the type of research questions we can address by exploring the alignment between research design, research questions, data analysis and knowledge claims. As our guiding theoretical frameworks push us to examine our participants in richer detail, we must simultaneously adapt our research design and analysis methods to account for these multi-faceted data. Presenters in this session will highlight four distinct methodologies, requiring advanced quantitative analysis techniques, that allowed them to develop detailed quantitative descriptions of students learning and attitudes. By comparing across presenters, participants will be able to trace how differences in each researchers guiding theoretical framework led to specific decisions about research design and analysis, allowing them to answer different types of research questions.",Jacquelyn Chini,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6481,University of Central Florida,,2016
6485,Poster Symposium,Methodologies Using Identity Frameworks,"As a field, Physics Education Research (PER) has its place in the national initiatives to address the underrepresentation of minority and female students in STEM fields. Questions of how to recruit, retains and have underrepresented students persist in STEM fields leads researchers to explore much more than student performance, into exploring who our students are and how they participate in the sciences. Theories of identity help researchers interpret persistence trends and reasons that correlate with group underrepresentation in the sciences.  In this invited poster symposia we discuss some design challenges such as choosing a theoretical framework of identity that informs the research question and analysis of data. We will also discuss how a design choice reflects the researchers own beliefs, biases, and perceptions of knowledge and education.
The poster symposia showcase identity theories within communities of practice, physics identity, critical race theory, intersectionality, and qualitative/quantitative data collection within these frameworks.",Idaykis Rodriguez,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6485,Florida International Univeristy,,2016
6484,Poster Symposium,Network Analysis in Physics Education Research,"This poster symposium showcases recent applications of network analysis in physics and science education research. Approaches include a focus on individual students (ego networks), a time-evolving range of interaction types for an entire class (multiplex networks), and combinations with other tools such as text mining and discourse analysis. Social network analysis can complement qualitative methods in exploring the rich complexity of student participation, and is especially valuable for capturing the many student-student interactions that are an integral part of active learning environments. Other applications of network analysis, rather than approximating a social landscape, uncover hidden connections and themes in dense bodies of text such as interview transcripts. The research in this session highlights a variety of ways that the network data perspective extends the existing methodological toolbox of physics education research.",Adrienne Traxler,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6484,Wright State University,Jesper Bruun,2016
6701,Symposium Poster,A Multi-faceted Approach to Measuring Student Understanding,"Data from the FMCE support findings that students' understanding of graphs impacts their abilities to express their understanding of the relationships between and among forces and various quantities of motion. We approach the current study with an assumption that measurements of student understanding of a particular topic depend not only on the student but also on the instrument used to make the measurement. Multiple measurements are needed to build a more complete picture of what the student actually ""knows."" We compare individual student responses to 12 specific questions on the FMCE from three question clusters. Each cluster provides students with four identical descriptions of object velocities. In one cluster students choose a description of an accompanying force, in the others students choose a graph of force or acceleration vs. time. We use Cohen's w to report the correlation between the clusters and consistency plots to show the impact of instruction.",Trevor I. Smith,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6701,Rowan University,Ian T. Griffin and Nicholas J. Wright,2016
6702,Symposium Poster,Addressing Relational Data in Students' Representation Use with Network Analysis,"Network analysis is aligned with a theoretical framework that values relational questions and connection between quantities. One of the problems of using frequentist statistics in education is that most statistical analyses (such as t-tests and analysis of variance) require normally distributed data set, with observations that are independent of one another; however, when studying students in a classroom, these assumptions are often violated.  Students interact with each other, instructors, and course material, allowing ideas to be transferred in a variety of ways.  Learning is embedded in these interactions and can be an exciting area to research but fundamentally requires a research design that captures relational data. This poster will present an example from our work on students' use of representations to demonstrate the types of questions that network analysis can answer, highlight a variety of the analyses that can be run with relational data, and address some of the challenges we faced in using this methodology.",Daryl McPadden,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6702,Florida International University,Jesper Bruun and Eric Brewe,2016
6696,Symposium Poster,CourseNetworking and community: Linking online discussion networks and course success,"We report on connections between student participation in an online course forum and their grades in an introductory physics class. Discussions started before the semester, ended after finals, and continued well beyond the level incentivized by extra credit. We collect all posts and replies and construct a bipartite network of actors (students) and events (threads) in the forum. The actor projection of this two-mode network is a weighted representation of students' mutual participation in discussion threads, and shows whether they are central or peripheral participants in the semester-long discussion community. We look for significant links between network centrality and final grades, as part of a larger investigation of the CourseNetworking software as an online community-building tool. These questions are especially relevant for institutions with many commuter and non-traditional students, where asynchronous forum talk is a key way for students to engage with their peers outside of class time.",Adrienne L.

6694,Symposium Poster,Development of physics identity in self-concept and practice: analysis of the Learning Assistant experience,"The physics department at Texas State University has implemented a Learning Assistant (LA) program in our introductory course sequences. We are interested in how participation in the LA program influences LAs' identity both as physics students and as physics teachers; in particular, how being part of the LA community changes participants' self-concepts and their day-to-day practice. Our analytic lens is a blended theoretical framework informed by the physics identity framework developed by Hazari et al., which relies on self-report of experiences and self-perception; and Lave and Wenger's theory of Communities of Practice, which focuses on the ways in which identity is enacted and negotiated. We describe the two theories and build a correspondence between factors in the physics identity framework and community of practice theory. This blended theory is used to analyze video of LA interviews and written artifacts for evidence of shifts in LA identity.",Eleanor W.

6699,Symposium Poster,Ego network analysis of upper division physics student survey,"We present the analysis of ego networks derived from a survey of upper division physics students. Analysis of ego networks are somewhat different than network analyses that are becoming more common in PER. Ego networks focus on the connections that center on one person (the ego). The ego networks in this poster come from a survey that is part of an overall project focused on understanding student retention and persistence. The theory underlying this work is that social and academic integration are essential components to supporting students continued enrollment and ultimately graduation. This work uses network analysis as a way to investigate the role of social and academic interactions in retention and persistence decisions. We focus on student interactions with peers, on mentoring interactions with physics department faculty, and on engagement in physics groups and how they influence persistence. Our results, which are preliminary, will help frame the ongoing research project and identify ways in which departments can support students.",Eric Brewe,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6699,Florida International University,"Justyna Zwolak, Remy Dou, and Eric Williams",2016
6693,Symposium Poster,Emergent Attitudinal Profiles of Introductory Engineering Students,"Traditionally, education studies that explicitly or implicitly examine differences between normative and non-normative groups have based their analysis by choosing a particular pre-defined normative group (e.g. majority race students), and then draw comparisons against that group. The researcher thus imposes a priori definitions of both what is important and how to group students for comparisons. This can put the research at odds with an intersectional approach to understanding individuals. A quantitative topological data analysis (TDA) allows us to answer research questions in a way that respects the intersectional diversity of the students. Using only quantitative affective data, including a spectrum of attitudes, beliefs and identity measures, but not student demographic information, we allow student responses to form emergent attitudinal profiles that define the normative characteristics of our sample of introductory engineering students.",Jacqueline Doyle,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6693,Florida International University,Geoff Potvin,2016
6704,Symposium Poster,Finding groups in student-level data: Utilizing the Profile Approach,"Individual students bring their own motivations and self-regulated study strategies to the classroom. When interested in characterizing students, one can turn to the Profile Approach. At the core of this approach is a theoretical framework that considers the interactions of different motivational and strategic self-regulatory constructs and describes the various, distinct patterns that exist across these constructs as Learning Profiles. The Profile Approach relies on individuals' characteristics; thus, accompanying research designs must incorporate collecting student-level data on various motivational and strategic self-regulatory constructs. Also, analyses must consider patterns across these constructs. Cluster analysis is such a technique, allowing identification of coherent groups (Learning Profiles) based on patterns in the data. Resulting Profiles are useful for exploring hypotheses about student characteristics, guiding instructors to better understand their students, and follow-up statistical analyses. I present--from start to finish--applying the Profile Approach to identify Learning Profiles among algebra-based, studio-mode physics students.",Jarrad W. T.

6697,Symposium Poster,"Integrating text-mining, network analysis and thematic discourse analysis to produce maps of student discussions about sustainability","We use a combination of network analysis (NA), text-mining (TM) techniques, and thematic discourse analysis (TDA) to characterise and compare student discussions about sustainable development. Three student groups at three different times were analysed. The analysis entails an iterative design where NA, TM, and TDA continuously inform each other to produce a rich and coherent picture of the discussions. The output of such an analysis is a set of maps of these discussions, which have both qualitative and quantitative uses. Qualitatively, the maps show how thematic patterns in the discussions are related for each group, and we can see how discourses differ between groups as well as over time. Quantitatively, we use network motif analysis, entropy based measures, and degree distributions to distinguish between discussions.",Mats Lindahl,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6697,Linnaeus University,Jesper Bruun and Cedric Linder,2016
6698,Symposium Poster,Investigating physics learning with layered student interaction networks: Combining time and modes of interaction,"Network analysis has previously been employed to show that centrality in student interaction networks can predict future grades. However, previous analyses have only been employed on isolated categories of student interactions which have been summed over time. In this study we use multiplex (layered) networks to relax these constraints. Within a week, we now allow bidirectional links between the same student as represented in two different layers, for example a layer representing problem solving interactions and another representing conceptual discussion, to model how these layers may interact. Likewise, we allow links from a student as represented in a network at time, t, and the same student in the network for time, t+1. The nature of links between network layers is different from the original links and thus need a theoretically based model. These models may yield insights into the interplay between categories of interaction into the significance of time development.",Jesper Bruun,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6698,Institut for Naturfagenes Didaktik,,2016
6695,Symposium Poster,Making Sense of Different Generalization and Selection Practices in PER,"In this poster, we will unpack the claim that different ways of generalizing and selecting in PER are tied to different assumptions about knowledge, our social world, and our reasons for knowing it.  In particular, we will compare and contrast the assumptions made by two different research paradigms: what we call case-oriented PER  which seeks to refine and develop theory by linking that theory to cases  and what we call recurrence-oriented PER  which seeks to inform instructional predictions by discerning reproducible, representative patterns and relationships.  We will discuss how the different assumptions instantiated within these two paradigms can help us make sense of differences in generalization and selection practices in PER.",Amy D.

6692,Symposium Poster,Scientific identity formation in black women physicists: A methodological approach,"When we look at underrepresented groups in science, Black women have particular experiences in the field. In this presentation we bring the perspectives of Black women in Physics in regards to the construction of scientific identity. Stemming from notions of identity as performance and using a Critical Race Theory (CRT) framework, we look at scientists' life trajectories to talk about how they develop their identity as physicists. Specifically, we will focus on the methods used to both unveil these narratives and analyze them. First, we will address interviewing as a method to collect data in Physics Education Research (PER). Then, we discuss the use of the qualitative analysis software Atlas.ti to help searching for emergent themes when dealing with interview transcripts as data. In addition, we talk about how qualitative analysis software can be an aid in reducing bias in qualitative research, which is rich and dense with information. With this work, we hope to bring CRT perspectives to the PER community and contribute with discussions around underrepresented groups in Physics.",Katemari Rosa,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6692,Universidade Federal de Campina Grande,,2016
6700,Symposium Poster,Students' progress during an assignment in computational physics: mental models and code development,"Solving physics problems in university physics education using a numerical approach requires knowledge and skills in several domains, for example, physics, mathematics, programming, and modeling. In this study students' mental models are monitored using interviews at several occasions during an assignment in computational physics. The interview data was analysed using a network analysis approach. Interview transcripts were coded according to the context dependent concepts that were used to define the particular context and situation of this assignment. The adjacency of concepts in the transcripts was assumed to reflect the associations between them made by students, and thus representing students' mental models of the problem solving situation at the time of the interview. For each student a network was built where the concepts were nodes and their adjacency formed the links between them. The changes in students' mental models between the interview occasions gave important information about what the students were focusing on at different stages of the solution process. What students focused on at the different interview occasions was assumed to be an indication of what they believed was useful in solving the task. The visualization of the mental models showed that at the beginning students were concerned about how to deal with writing the Matlab code that was needed to model the problem. As students got more comfortable with the coding process, the physics needed to assure that their simulation was following physics principles, such as energy conservation, became more and more central in their narratives. This study gives important contribution to how networks can be used to model students' thinking in a particular context and provides important knowledge about students' progress in a task in computational physics.",Madelen Bodin,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6700,Ume� University,,2016
6703,Symposium Poster,Using structural equation modeling to test the physics identity framework,"Fully modeling the complex relationships between multiple factors in a theoretical framework requires connecting several statistical techniques. Structural equation modeling (SEM) combines confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), path analysis, and multiple regression. Rather than providing a form of exploratory data analysis, SEM is a confirmatory technique that involves testing and modifying a hypothesized model. Specific tests indicate ways to improve the model, and a variety of fit indices are used to assess the model fit. The implementation of SEM will be shown through the example of testing the physics identity theoretical framework. This includes performing the initial CFA to verify the identity dimensions and assessing model fit. Additionally, the method of modeling multiple groups will be demonstrated by comparing the physics identity model for males and for females. Examples of implementation will be shown in R. Furthermore, the types of research questions to which SEM is most applicable will be described.",Robynne M.

6706,Symposium Talk,"""I have a good idea!"": Insights from video analysis that count even if they cannot be counted","Instructors often use engineering design projects to provide students with opportunities to make sense of physics concepts, but do students take them up in this way? I will report on research that approached this question via two contrasting methods: a code-oriented approach based on a classroom observation protocol as well as an insight-oriented approach based on video analysis (Scherr, 2009). The code-oriented approach revealed a rare moment of scientific sense-making during a 6th-grade pneumatics project in which a vocal male student reported having a ""good idea."" The insight-oriented approach of this good idea revealed that the idea was not Roger's alone  a quieter female student had made a subtle yet substantive contribution that went uncounted. This case illustrates how code-oriented approaches can complement insight-oriented video analysis, while highlighting how some insights can emerge more readily from video data than code counting, with implications for equity in engineering and science classrooms.",Luke Conlin,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6706,Stanford University,,2016
6727,Symposium Talk,A theory-guided research agenda for physics teacher education,"The authors have recently proposed a theoretical perspective to guide the development and improvement of physics teacher education (PTE) programs. According to the Development of Habits through Apprenticeship in a Community (DHAC), the primary role of PTE programs is to help novice teachers to develop the requisite habits of mind and habits of practice through apprenticeship in a community centered around master teachers and veteran teachers, all of whom share a similar framework for what physics learning consists of and how it can be realized. This conceptual model explains features of effective PTE programs and makes testable predictions. In this session, the authors will describe briefly the DHAC theoretical perspective and propose a research agenda to test it, refine it, and build on it.",Eugenia Etkina,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6727,Rutgers University,"Bor Gregorcic, Uppsala University

6720,Symposium Talk,Articulating Problems,"""The formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill. To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old questions from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science."" (Einstein & Infield, 1938)
We present results from a project, The dynamics of learners' engagement and persistence in science, funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (#3475). In this work, we first identify exemplars of students' doing science, working with a team of scientists to vet candidate episodes from existing data as well as new data collected in undergraduate courses. We then analyze each case, to understand what we can of its particular dynamics. Finally, we look across the cases for patterns. In this presentation, we discuss one finding: Six of the nine cases involve students working to articulate and motivate problems, where by ""problem,"" we mean an inconsistency or gap in understanding. This work of problematizing, we contend, reflects disciplinary practices in science: Doing science involves having and expressing uncertainty and confusion, and working within realms of uncertainty to pin down what, precisely, is not understood. We argue for valuing students' attempts at articulating a problem as scientific activity, and the articulation of a problem as a scientific achievement in its own right. Drawing on our analysis, we present responsive teaching moves and strategies that can support students' problematizing.",Anna Phillips,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6720,Tufts University,"Jessica Watkins, Tufts University

The course follows a partially flipped classroom model and incorporates multimedia elements including video interviews with biomedical experts, an online homework system, and original texts. Student attitudes were measured using the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey, additional survey questions specific to the course, and student interviews. Students' conceptual understanding of the physics material and its application in biomedical technology was also assessed. The results of the IPLS course will be compared to those of the traditional course, which was taught concurrently and covered similar physical concepts.

This talk explores UMD's response to the pedagogical issues of and content revisions needed in IPLS courses, as life science students often are resistant to and question the biological relevance and authenticity of the subject matter.  To address this student response, we advocate for the creation of course revisions built on a theoretical framework that encompasses biological authenticity; authentic scientific practice; student-centered, active learning; and attention to affect--all coupled to iterative revision with experience.  We do this through a discussion of how prior and current PER work can be used to form a theoretical framework for content revision and course development, providing both existing illustrative examples from the UMD NEXUS/Physics project (www.nexusphysics.umd.edu) and newly-developed examples from the Understanding and Overcoming Barriers to Using Mathematics in Science project as context.",Kim Moore,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6717,"Department of Physics, University of Maryland","Deborah Hemingway, Biophysics Program, University of Maryland",2016
6731,Symposium Talk,Blending mathematical formalism and gestures when separating variables in physics,"When looking at learning on short time scales, we find evidence that students' gestures and words both play a role in how new ideas develop. We use the conceptual blending framework to describe the creation of new knowledge in the moment - perhaps fleetingly, never to be used again, perhaps more permanently. Regardless of the time scale of the effect, blending is a model that lets us describe meaning that is emergent in the moment. So, can blending help us answer questions about the definition of learning? Or is it a just-so story, one that doesn't provide a next step for our study of knowledge and learning?",Michael C.

6733,Symposium Talk,Conceptual blending as a framework for modeling the coordinated use of ontological metaphors,"Intuitive reasoning and communication about abstract science concepts are often achieved through the use of ontological metaphors: metaphors about what kind of entity something is.  Previous work has shown that both students and experts can productively coordinate multiple metaphors for energy, particularly energy as a substance and energy as a vertical location, and that this coordination can be modeled using the framework of conceptual blending.  We apply this blending analysis to a group of students trying to understand the mechanism for atomic emission spectra.  The students create a blended mental space that enables them to arrive at a conceptual resolution.  The blended ontology is useful to these students in resolving their disagreement, and the blending framework is useful to researchers in understanding how the students did this.",Benjamin W.

Building on sociocultural theories that consider cognition a social process, we propose blending theory as a descriptive and analytic tool for use in examining the processes of collective reasoning.  We present data from focus groups at CU Boulder in which Modern Physics students engage in reasoning about quantum phenomena and negotiate ontological conceptions of quantum entities such as electrons and photons (i.e. negotiating what kind of a thing an electron or photon is). We present a conceptual blending analysis of group discourse within this context, and show how conceptual blending theory can be used to describe both collectively constructed blends and more traditional individual blends.",Jessica Hoy,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6732,University of Colorado Boulder,"Noah D.

6723,Symposium Talk,"Data, Variables, and Evidence: Specifying Theoretically Sound Predictive Models","In conducting large-scale research efforts which seek to determine the effect of active learning and Learning Assistant support on student outcomes, we routinely collect massive amounts of data from a variety of measurement instruments. Each of these data sources carries with it implicit assumptions about learning. For example, pre-post concept inventory and gain scores assume a cognitive theory of learning, where the latent construct resides in an individual's singular mind. On the other hand, characterizations of student interactions within a collective classroom network assume at least a socio-cognitive (if not sociocultural) view on learning, where interactions between individuals contribute to development of understanding or sophistication. Using different data sources such as these to define distinct variables within the same quantitative model requires theoretical justification and articulation of an explicit learning theoretical framework. In this presentation we describe our work in dealing with these issues.",Robert M.

Our methodology involves a large scale (N = 100+) qualitative study with in-depth (1 hour long) semi-structured interviews. Challenges include identifying appropriate samples across diverse contexts (even a limited field like optics has very diverse workplace practices), triangulating views on workplace skills (entry-level employee perspectives vs managers vs HR), making personal connections with a wide range of industry folks despite being an outsider from academia, organizing and analyzing large scale qualitative data, and trying to conduct and communicate research that both academically trained physicists and industrial physicists and engineers find relevant.",Anne Leak,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6718,Rochester Institute of Technology,"Ben Zwickl, Rochester Institute of Technology",2016
6708,Symposium Talk,Designing for discovery in semi-structured clinical interviews,"There are two important affordances of interviews I take advantage of in my work. The first is the ability to respond adaptively to interviewee's ideas. Rather than setting activities and research questions in stone beforehand, clinical interviews afford a mix of preparation and adaptation. This allows me to, in-the-moment, probe interesting patterns of reasoning and understanding that might emerge unexpectedly. The second affordance of interviews is that they allow for focused video data collection. This allows me to capture an interview without needing to pre-define what aspects of student reasoning I want to capture. To illustrate these points, I'll provide an example of how I designed, performed, and analyzed interviews around quantitative approximations in math and physics problems.",Eric Kuo,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6708,Stanford University,,2016

By focusing on the active portions of a class we are making the assumption that it is in the co-construction of answers that meaningful learning and development occurs.

Previously we have reported evidence of physics identity development from analysis of interviews with LAs and written reflections. Our data now include video of weekly LA preparation sessions as well, which allows us to examine relationships between individual LAs' self-concepts and self-reported practices (in interviews) and their observed practices (in LA prep sessions), and to analyze the degree of alignment between the two. The processes of data collection and collaborative analysis are interspersed, with themes and questions emerging from analyses shaping interview questions. In this session, we will discuss affordances and constraints of this open-ended approach and of the data sources we have available, and findings of our study to date.",Eleanor W.

6713,Symposium Talk,Examining the implementation of a new IPLS course at UNC-CH,"At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, we have completed the implementation of our redesigned introductory physics course for life science (IPLS) majors. The new course aligns introductory physics concepts with authentic biological applications. We were influenced by cognitive theories of learning to reform the pedagogy to confront or build upon students' prior knowledge and intuitions in order to develop more expert-like understandings. This reformed pedagogy, implemented in the lecture/studio format [1,2], fosters student participation and enculturation into the practices of the discipline, as advocated by situated models of learning. We will present data on the effectiveness of this course, including results from well-known concept inventories such as the FCI and CSEM, and student performance on exam questions. We will make comparisons to data collected prior to the course transformation and present a review of student survey data, C-LASS results, and comments from faculty teaching the course.

6734,Symposium Talk,Exploring the nature of mental model blending in the context of sound propagation,"While constructing their understanding in various science areas, students go through transitional phases that may involve richly developed and consistently used mental models. These transitional models are unique cognitive structures composed of elements of both scientifically accepted and the commonly used initial alternative models.  Such transitional models have been previously referred to as hybrid models or blend models. We will discuss the nature of model blending in the context of sound propagation and the issues that surface in their eliciting.",Zdeslav Hrepic,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6734,Columbus State University,"Dean A.

6712,Symposium Talk,From rich points to research questions: A design-based research approach,"Design based research assumes a complex learning system and allows for researching cognition in context. Such research designs involve systematically observing and understanding learning while also designing curriculum, pedagogy, or contexts. The goal of design-based research is not to improve a specific context (though it may do so); the goal is to contribute to models and theories of how learners think. In our work, we create curricular modules based on research and then observe the curriculum in practice, paying special attention to instances when what happens in the classroom deviates from what we anticipate. We call these ""rich points"" after Agar's work (2000). Such events may indicate that elementary school students misinterpreted the activity goals (a local problem) or struggled to complete tasks we expect to be trivial (which may have implications for how children learn). Identifying such events through observations and discussion uncover new research questions and directions.",Danielle B.

6709,Symposium Talk,Instructor's framing affects students' framing in upper-division physics problem solving,"Problem solving is an important part of learning physics at all levels.  In our work, we study students' in-class problem solving in upper-division physics courses.  We are particularly interested in how students interact with each other and with the instructor to use mathematics and build meaning in solving physics problems.

In our Electromagnetic Fields course, students spend the majority of class time solving problems in small groups; the instructor occasionally interrupts or assists them. From video data of students' problem solving, we abstract the students' and instructor's epistemological frames and frame shifts.  We look for trends in how students shift between frames during problem solving, and how the instructor's framing affects the students'.  From this quantitative work on framing trends comes new theory at the junction of framing and interaction analysis.",Hai Nguyen,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6709,Kansas State University,"Deepa Chari, Kansas State University",2016
6719,Symposium Talk,Meta-affective learning,"We present an analysis of interview data and written work from a freshman engineering student, Marya, to illustrate the substantive role of affect in her learning experiences within a reformed introductory physics course. Marya described how, through this course, she shifted from being intimidated by physics to feeling excited about and empowered to do physics. We claim that at the heart of Marya's transformation is a shift in her attitudes and dispositions with respect to struggle, confusion, and uncertainty in the doing of science. We see this shift as an example of meta-affective learning-- i.e., the development of productive feelings and dispositions for navigating intellectual challenges. Marya described how she came to see physics as a pursuit of understanding rather than being about absolutes. Correspondingly, she shifted from feeling anxious about ""being wrong"" to taking pleasure in exploring ideas and making discoveries. Marya's transformation invites us to attend carefully to the role of meta-affect in science, and to foster students' productive dispositions with respect to struggle, confusion, and uncertainty as an important target in science education.",Jen Radoff,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6719,Tufts University,"Lama Jaber, Florida State University

6705,Symposium Talk,Multimodal analysis of the interactional work of transforming participation structures in a middle-school classroom,"Participation frameworks in classrooms are co-constructed and co-maintained by the interactional work of teachers and students. We show how sequential, multimodal analysis of video records can reveal the embodied resources participants enlist to achieve transformations in participation frameworks during group-work when a teacher has been called over to help in a middle school Project-Based Inquiry Science (PBIS) course. Our ethnomethodological analysis traces the process of how an epistemically asymmetrical, teacher-led Initiation, Response, Evaluation (IRE) sequence is re-negotiated into an epistemically symmetrical, student-led inquiry sequence that eventually excludes the teachers' contributions. Our multimodal analysis is able to show how students' sensitivity and responsiveness to prosodic cues enable them to differentiate known-answer questions from felicitous, information-seeking questions. Creating opportunities for and sustaining student-led inquiry sequences are interactional achievements rather than solely the achievement of curricular design and therefore require fine-grained video analyses of classroom interaction.",Benedikt W.

6710,Symposium Talk,Network analysis of student collaboration,"How does student collaboration, both within small groups and between these groups, change in an intensive lab setting? We answer this research question by studying the IMPRESS (Integrating Metacognitive Practices and Research to Ensure Student Success) summer experience - a bridge program for first generation college and deaf/hard of hearing students designed to teach them how to reflect on, evaluate, and change their own thinking. The research team collected video data for the entire two week period, capturing small group and group to group interactions from a variety of angles.  We apply social network analysis (SNA), a well suited approach for studying individual student integration into a group as well as the dynamics of the group as a whole, to the video data. SNA uses the notion of nodes and ties to represent students and interactions between them. This method of analysis gives us a way to describe the IMPRESS students' collaboration quantitatively and visually in order to answer our research question.",Annie Chase,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6710,San Jose State University,"Justyna Zwolak, Florida International University

6707,Symposium Talk,On moral stances and perspective-taking through video analysis,"Video analysis of students engaged in physics discussions has led to many insights into how students think about and participate in explanation-building and problem-solving in physics. However, analysis of video-records of students' discussions on topics beyond physics content can illustrate expansive uses of video-analysis tools, while simultaneously expanding our toolbox for analyzing students' understanding of physics. I present our ongoing analysis of video-records of engineering students engaged in discussions of socio-scientific issues in clinical focus-group settings, focused on the shifting moral and epistemic stances adopted by students in the discussion. Merging their stance-taking dynamic with fine-grained attention to the content of their talk provides insights into characterizing what perspectives students adopt in their utterances and how these might (or might not) align with stakeholders in the socio-scientific issue. The analysis highlights the role of attending to word choice, gestures, postures, talk sequences, and register changes in making claims about students' stances and perspectives.",Ayush Gupta,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6707,"University of Maryland, College Park",,2016
6729,Symposium Talk,Project lab course for first year students: Cutting the Gordian knot in physics teacher preparation,"One of the major problems in training of future teachers is finding an authentic environment where they can practice new approaches to teaching and learning. Ideally, you want to place your students with reformed in-service teachers but unfortunately often this is not possible. In our department we took a different approach. We created Project lab course which pre-service physics teachers take twice: first time as students (in their first year of studies) and second time as future teachers (in their 4th or 5th year). As first year students they work on open-ended experimental projects. During their second time, already enrolled in the Physics Teacher preparation program, they design project tasks for first year students, observe groups of students solving problems and evaluate their reports using scientific abilities rubrics. I will describe logistical details of such clinical experience and present examples of pre-service teacher work and their reflections on the experience.",Gorazd Planinsic,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6729,"University of Ljubljana, Slovenia",,2016
6721,Symposium Talk,"Reducing the ""real world""/classroom divide","What does it look like to create educational spaces that reduce barriers between the classroom and the ""real world""? We report on two research strands (Transformative Experiences (TE) and Definitional Ownership (DO)) that examine related goals: students use ideas constructed in class (a concept or a definition) to ""see"" their everyday world in new and meaningful ways. (E.g. ""I am now constantly thinking about how light rays travel"" and ""I see thresholds everywhere now!"") Research on these strands require methodological innovations; we will discuss novel analysis methods as well as our ongoing efforts to connect with existing methodologies and research strands. For instance, the following shared theme has emerged from our joint work: positioning students as accountable authors (Greeno, 2006) of scientific concepts plays a role in an expansive framing (Engle, 2006; Engle, et al, 2012) of classroom activity; such framing, we hypothesize, fosters both TE and DO.

6711,Symposium Talk,Rich interactions in an informal learning environment,"Informal physics learning environments are often highly complex and can vary widely in terms of format, goals, and participants. Effective assessments of informal settings need to align with the rules and norms of the environment in order to accurately reflect students' knowledge and experiences. In the case of informal learning that is exploratory and self-directed, formalized assessments such as concept inventories with multiple choice or Likert-style questions may not be appropriate. Observational data is one means of capturing the dynamics of such informal environments. We have spent the past three years collecting video from afterschool sessions where K-8 children and university students work together on open-ended, hands-on physics activities. In our afterschool program, many independent activities take place simultaneously; to capture a sample of these activities, we have structurally embedded and normalized daily video/audio recording for participants. Based on the recorded interactions between participants, we have developed research questions by applying a socio-cultural lens. We analyze moments of ""rich"" interaction using an activity theoretic framework and have characterized the pedagogical moves by university student volunteers, the response of K-8 students to these moves and the generation of scientifically creative ideas by K-8 students. These research findings inform our own program design and contribute to the broader understanding of teaching and learning physics in informal environments.",Katie Hinko,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6711,PISEC and JILA,,2016
6730,Symposium Talk,Strong introductory courses + professors who care about teaching = physics teachers,"Previously at the University of Arkansas (UA), and now at West Virginia University (WVU), we have led physics teacher preparation programs as part of the Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC). Our invitation to apply as one of the first primary program institutions was initiated by our NSF program officer, based on his familiarity with our reformed introductory course. Years of student interviews supported that it was both the opportunity to engage in an  environment supporting real learning with their peers and having professors who felt education was important that empowered students to choose a teaching career. 15 years after having its first PhysTEC graduate, UA remains in the 5+Club. At WVU, we are also seeing significant impact from these factors. We will discuss the characteristics reported by the students as most impactful on their decision to teach, and shown by our research to have strong correlation with improved learning.",Gay Stewart,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6730,West Virginia University,"John Stewart, West Virginia University",2016

We use a retrospective survey methodology which relies on the natural variation in experiences and background of a large sample of college students in these courses. The Learning Assistant Survey of Practices (LASP) was administered in Fall 15' in collaborative classrooms supported with LAs in a large public Hispanic-Serving Institution.  The survey study focuses on how classroom interactions with LAs are associated to academic performance, affective outcomes, and career aspirations. LA practices under examination include the frequency of interactions, types of conversations between LAs and students, discussion facilitation, conditions that encourage student participation, and positioning acts.  In the current presentation, we will discuss the theoretical framework that guided the development of the instrument and preliminary results.",Hagit Kornreich-Leshem,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6725,"STEM Transformation Institute, Florida International University","Rocio Benabentos, STEM Transformation Institute, Florida International University

6715,Symposium Talk,The Need For New Instruments: Assessing Interdisciplinary Thinking,"Interdisciplinary thinking and reconciliation is integral to developing a coherent understanding of science. Significant research has gone into addressing this problem, particularly in the context of biology and physics. Projects like NEXUS resulted in the development of courses and materials that are meaningful to students across the disciplines and can serve as prototypes for similar endeavors. The development of these research-based courses has created a need for new assessment tools. We outline the preliminary stages of development of an instrument to assess how students connect essential ideas across introductory science disciplines and how students expect the disciplines to relate. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 biology majors enrolled in a physics course. The students were asked to explain everyday interdisciplinary phenomena as well as to describe their attitudes toward different disciplines and making connections between them. An analysis of these interviews is a first step toward developing a framework for an interdisciplinary assessment.",K. K.

6714,Symposium Talk,The source of student engagement in IPLS,"Effectively teaching an Introductory Physics for the Life Sciences (IPLS) course means engaging life science students in a subject matter for which they may not have considerable preexisting interest. While we have found that the inclusion of topical examples of relevance to life-science students can help to engage students whose initial interest in physics is less developed, we have found that the inclusion of biological content is just one of several dimensions supporting student engagement in IPLS. When describing what is salient to them about their IPLS experiences, students are just as quick to cite particular pedagogical structures and supports as they are to cite issues relating directly to content choices. In this talk we begin to unpack this complex interplay of content and pedagogy in fostering student engagement in the IPLS classroom. We also describe the role that explicit messaging around disciplinary coherence may play in students' experiences.",Benjamin D.

6735,Symposium Talk,Using conceptual blending to analyze student inquiry and embodied engagement in a technology-enabled collaborative learning environment,"With the help of digital technology, we can nowadays design inquiry-based learning materials on topics that were traditionally out of experimental reach. One example is using an interactive whiteboard and the software Algodoo to allow students to ""create"" and ""throw"" planets into orbits around the Sun. As students engage in this immersive exercise and make sense of what is going on, they intuitively draw on their everyday embodied experiences of throwing objects and using touch-screen devices, as well as their ideas about the universe, physics formalisms and computer simulations. The conceptual blending framework allows us to make better sense of what students bring into such a complex activity and how we can help them gain a physicist-like understanding of the relationships between the ""universe out there"", physics formalisms, computer simulations and their everyday world.",Bor Gregorcic,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6735,Uppsala University,"Jesper Haglund, Uppsala University",2016
6722,Symposium Talk,What Multi-Level Models Can Tell Us About Learning Assistants and Equity,"The Learning Assistant (LA) Student Supported Outcomes (LASSO) project collects multi-disciplinary data from LA-using institutions across the country. The data falls into three categories: (1) student data (e.g. pre & post test scores, gender, and ethnicity), (2) course data (e.g. discipline, LA-uses, & instructor), and (3) institution data (e.g. institution type & term type). In this investigation, we develop a theoretical framework that is based in Critical Race Theory and Cultural Historical Activity Theory. To examine the dynamic interactions between varying components of the activity system, we develop Multi-Level Models that nest data within other sets of data. In our models student level data is nested within course level data, which is nested within institution level data. This allows us to measure and control for the complex interactions between various classroom and institutional contexts when analyzing student outcomes. In this sessions we will examine the impacts of LAs on diverse students and contexts.",Ben Van Dusen,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2016/detail.cfm?ID=6722,"Department of Science Education, California State University, Chico","Jada-Simone White, Department of Science Education, California State University, Chico",2016

Therefore, work in this area has focused on designing curriculum that includes authentic biological problems, promotes interdisciplinary scientific thinking, and builds coherence between physics and biology.  These new pedagogical perspectives then must be joined with the already existing models of student learning for a comprehensive framework.    The demands of this course are giving rise to the development of new theoretical frameworks, research-based transformations, and assessments.
