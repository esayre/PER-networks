6187,Contributed Poster Presentation,A Case Study:  Novel Group Interactions through Introductory Computational Physics,"With the advent of high-level programming languages capable of quickly rendering three-dimensional simulations, the inclusion of computers as a learning tool in the classroom has become more prevalent.  Although work has begun to study the patterns seen in implementing and assessing computation in introductory physics, more insight is needed to understand the observed effects of blending computation with physics in a group setting.  In a newly adopted format of introductory calculus-based mechanics, called Projects and Practices in Physics, groups of students work on short modeling projects  which make use of a novel inquiry-based approach  to develop their understanding of both physics content and practice.  Preliminary analyses of observational data of groups engaging with computation, coupled with synchronized computer screencast, has revealed a unique group interaction afforded by the practices specific to computational physics  problem debugging.",Michael J.

6213,Contributed Poster Presentation,A Kinesthetic Circulatory System Model for Teaching Fluid Dynamics,"Students often leave Introductory Physics for Life Science (ILPS) courses without the understanding of real# fluid dynamics, which is necessary for them to be successful in their future biology courses.  In an effort to reconcile this issue, researchers at UNE have focused on improving students understanding of the circulatory system. This requires students to apply multiple fluid dynamics concepts, specifically: conservation of mass, Bernoulli's principle and the Hagen-Poiseuille's law.  After interviewing a number of students during the past four years, the researchers developed a kinesthetic circulatory system model made of transparent plastic tubing of different radii and branched connectors.  This model enabled students to see the fluid travel at different speeds (visually) and different pressures (using digital pressure sensors) similar to the cardiovascular system.  Evaluation of this learning module indicates substantial improvement in student understanding and appreciation of real fluid dynamics concepts.

6047,Contributed Poster Presentation,A case study of lab development in the developing world,"In this presentation, I would like to discuss the various aspects of establishing a contemporary and low-cost University physics laboratory in the developing world. In particular, the process of laboratory development requires various fine balancing acts. First, indigenization based on locally available resources is to be balanced with the importation of technology. The latter is not only costly but one has to also face bureaucratic import rules and the unwillingness of foreign companies to deal with particular developing countries. Second, there is a cultural philosophy prevalent in many Asian countries of considering experiments a handmaiden to theory. Therefore, laboratory courses are mostly always tied up as ""parasites"" to theory courses. Third, there are various internal pressures and conflicting demands imposed by the local University administration. For example, development of laboratory is considered to be inferior to classroom teaching or doing ""elite"" physics. I will present the example of the Physics Laboratory at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) where all of these challenges, arguably, have been successfully addressed.",Muhammad Sabieh Anwar,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6047,"Department of Physics, Lahore University of Management Sciences",,2015

We also attend to two non-verbal features in the data, gestures and pauses. In this paper we focus on each analytic feature, first describing the relevant research base and then explaining how we operationalize it in our analyses.

This study also presented evidence that working knowledge of the ijk format was necessary to correctly perform vector operations in the arrow format, which has implications for instruction at the algebra level, as many courses and texts exclusively use the arrow format and neglect the ijk format.  We conducted a study of students in an algebra-based introductory physics course where students were given no explicit instruction on the ijk format, but had received instruction on the arrow format.  We find that the algebra-based students perform significantly higher in the ijk representation than the arrow representation in both one- and two-dimensional problems.

Rimacs dialogues implement empirically-derived principles to guide the tutor in asking questions about the concepts associated with a problem, and the tutors feedback on students responses.  These principles stem from our extensive analyses of tutoring sessions between human physics teachers and students.  We describe a recent study that compared two versions of Rimac in high school physics classrooms: an experimental version that deliberately executes the tutoring principles and a control version that does not, but implements prior state-of-the-art dialogue generation practices.

These four conditions varied according to the type of examples compared (single concept vs. synthesis) and structural similarity to the target problem (near vs. far). Taken together, the analogical reasoning conditions had a significant effect (d=0.31) over control. However, there were no significant differences between the different analogical reasoning conditions, or between analogical reasoning and priming.

Student behavior during two-phase exams with individual and team phases,"In a two-phase exam, students take the exam twice: once individually, and a second time working in teams. Proponents of such exams hope that during the team phase, students will meaningfully discuss questions they disagreed upon during the individual phase by sharing their reasoning, challenging each other, and reaching consensus. Proponents fear that students will uncritically adopt the majority answer or follow the team member they perceive as best. To investigate the preponderance of these behaviors, we use students' individual- and team-phase responses from the final exams of four different introductory physics courses to infer teams' answer-selection dynamics. We also characterize individual- to team-phase improvement rates and identify factors that correlate with improvement. Our particular two-phase exam implementation is especially conducive to analysis because it encourages but does not require teams to agree on a common answer, and allows students to signal uncertainty by ""hedging their bets"" for partial credit.",Ian D.

Network analysis tools provide a quantitative complement to this picture, allowing researchers to describe the social interactions of whole classrooms as systems. Past results from introductory physics courses have suggested a sharp division in the formation of social structure between large lecture sections and small studio classroom environments. Extending those results, this study focuses on calculus-based introductory physics courses at a large public university with a heavily commuter and nontraditional student population. I use community detection network methods to characterize pre- and post-course collaborative structure in several sections and consider differences between small and large classes. I will compare these results with expectations from earlier findings, and comment on implications for instruction and further study.",Adrienne L.

6266,Contributed Poster Presentation,Comparing Inquiry Labs to Traditional Labs in Introductory College Physics,"This study investigates the impact of changing two aspects of a traditional physics I lab on student attitudes and retention.  First of all, the labs were changed from cook book  style labs where students were told exactly what to do in each step of the lab to inquiry labs where students were asked to determine the best way to approach solving a problem with the given equipment.  The second change involved using more basic equipment such as stop watches and meter sticks instead of the more complicated equipment normally used in physics I labs.  It was theorized that students would understand the physics behind the labs more clearly if they did not have to spend a large portion of the lab learning to use the equipment and getting it to work correctly.  This study involves three physics I labs taught by the same professor during the summer of 2013.  Two of the classes were taught using the standard lab book and equipment.  The third class was taught using different labs with different equipment to teach the same physics concepts.  We found that students enjoyed the inquiry labs more and looked forward to the next assignment.  Furthermore students spent less time getting the equipment to work and more time learning the physics concepts.","Erin C.

6057,Contributed Poster Presentation,Computation across the curriculum: What skills are needed?,"Computation, the use of a computer to solve, simulate, or visualize a physical problem, has revolutionized how physics research is done. Computation is used widely to model systems, to simulate experiments, and to analyze data. Yet, in most undergraduate programs, students have little formal opportunity to engage with computation and, thus, are left to their own to develop their computational expertise. As part of a larger project to study how computation is incorporated in some undergraduate physics programs (and how it might be further incorporated), we have conducted a series of interviews with industry professionals, academic faculty, and employed bachelor's graduates who make use of computation in their everyday work. We present results from these interviews that speak to how interview participants developed the requisite skills to do professional computational work and what skills they perceive are necessary to conduct such work.

Students in the study were part of a research seminar at the University of Maryland in which they worked with faculty and graduate student research mentors on research projects.  In videotaped interviews and classroom discussions, we asked students to describe their experiences in research. Students developed nuanced views about how the research process works.

Our research analyzed the relationship between students participation in different areas of two consecutive ILE physics classes that implemented the Investigative-Science-Learning-Environment (ISLE) curriculum, a type of widely used ILE, and their ability to learn new physics through teamwork. We quantified students participation in two areas: in-class learning-activities and class review sessions. To measure students ability to learn through teamwork, we gave them group exams that presented real life scenarios that could only be understood using physics they had not yet learned. We then gave them standard physics problems related to the group exam problems to solve individually. Our results suggest that successful students built an effective habit of teamwork learning through participating in group learning activities, whereas students who were disengaged in review did not perform well in these teamwork learning activities.",Binod Nainabasti,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6261,Florida International University,"David T.

6285,Contributed Poster Presentation,Contradictory teacher goals for the teaching of energy,"Teachers discussing pedagogical strategies to help students with an incorrect idea about potential energy expressed contradictory goals for their teaching. Initially, teachers wished to avoid being overly complicated in their teaching, for example by asking students to stick to naming the forms of energy in the system and principles like the law of conservation of energy. But, the teachers conversation about a proposed simple pedagogical strategy showed an interest in mechanism  as well as an operational use of energy transformations and conservation. Later on, teachers recognized that students might also engage in and have good ideas about more complex ideas in class. Thus, the desire for keeping instruction simple was contradicted both by an awareness that a simple situation required a complex description and by the recognition that students were capable of more complex analysis, even if it interfered with the goals of simple instruction.",Michael C.

6183,Contributed Poster Presentation,Department Action Teams: Empowering Faculty to Make Sustainable Change,"We describe a new type of faculty working group, a Department Action Team (DAT), that forms one component of a larger strategy towards enacting cultural change in higher education. DATs empower a team of faculty members within a single department to make focused, sustainable change in their department. DATs focus on departmental development, as faculty design and implement strategies to address an educational problem of mutual interest and broad-scale importance (rather than trying to solve the problem themselves). This contrasts other faculty development efforts like Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs), which support the individual development of faculty from different departments through reflection on separate education projects. We contextualize the DAT model through a case study of a group within a physics department that is focused on improving gender equity among their undergraduate majors. Building on this case, we offer general principles for facilitating and developing similar groups at other institutions.",Joel Corbo,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6183,University of Colorado Boulder,"Daniel Reinholz

6125,Contributed Poster Presentation,Determining strategies that predict physics identity: Emphasizing recognition and interest,"Although the number of students earning bachelors degrees in physics has increased, the percentage of those degrees earned by women has not increased for more than 10 years. We use a physics identity framework to understand the factors that may impact physics career choice. Physics identity consists of three dimensions: recognition (perception of recognition by others), interest (desire to learn more), and performance/competence (perception of ability to understand). Our previous work has shown that recognition and interest are more significant predictors of physics career choice than performance/competence, and that women may require more recognition than men in order to choose physics careers. Therefore, teaching strategies that specifically target recognition and interest should be identified. Using data from a survey administered to a nationally representative sample of college students, we use regression models to determine which teaching strategies predict recognition and which strategies predict interest.",Robynne M.

Many people would answer, no, and yet, crafting definitions is an important skill across the STEM disciplines. There is also evidence that when students are handed definitions, they struggle to use them and sometimes even outright reject them as useful. I describe one promising definition-crafting activity for college physics students. I also propose a new construct: Definitional Ownership. I outline what strands might be important to this construct. I then focus methodologically on one strand of Definitional Ownership: the extent to which students actually use the words and phrases in their definitions in practice.

Therefore, to help students better experience and understand science it is important to repeatedly engage them in the act of testing.  Here, roughly 40 students in an undergraduate algebra-based introductory physics course were introduced to the concept of Bayesian learning at the beginning of the semester.  A series of in-class activities were developed which asked students to try solving an end-of-chapter problem, then to evaluate their solution by conducting a special-case analysis, and then to update their subjective confidence in their solution using Bayes Theorem.  A set of lab activities were also designed to incorporate the use of Bayes Theorem when updating student confidence in physical models after conducting testing experiments.  The design of these activities will be discussed, as well as student performance on the activities and the observed relationship to performance on EBAPS and CLASS.",Aaron R.

6241,Contributed Poster Presentation,Developing a Reliable Coding Scheme for Identifying Resources,"By using the resource-based model of cognition, physics education researchers have been able to develop a more complete understanding of the fine-grained details of students reasoning. Many studies that use the resource-based model of cognition derive their findings from strictly qualitative analyses of data. These studies have been invaluable; however the qualitative nature of these studies limits the scope of knowledge that we can gain by using the resource-based model of cognition. By using mixed methods of data analysis we can discover and communicate patterns that we would be unable to if we limited our analysis to strictly qualitative methods. In order for a mixed methods approach to be viable, we must develop reliable coding schemes for identifying resources.

6301,Contributed Poster Presentation,Disciplinary Differences in Physics Teacher Evaluation Bias: The Case of Engineering Students,"In earlier work, we measured student evaluations of high school science teachers (biology, chemistry, and physics) and identified discipline-specific gender bias: women teachers tend to be underrated by male students (only) in biology and chemistry, but are underrated by both men and women in physics.  More recently, we showed that students' physics identities exacerbate this bias, with physics-identified students exhibiting greater gender bias than those with less affinity for physics, which is a worrying result for those interested to recruit more women to physics.  The data in the current study is drawn from the Sustainability and Gender in Engineering (SaGE) study, which collected students' prior high school science experiences, their evaluations of their teachers, as well as their career and major intentions.

Students were told the theory behind the experiment and what data to collect, with follow-up questions meant to aid their comprehension.  Each of the experiments was kept, but instead of students being given an extensive lab packet, they were given a single sheet with guidance about generic procedures for investigating the relevant ideas.  In effect, the labs were fully transformed with very little time investment and no need for new equipment.

6260,Contributed Poster Presentation,Exploring Student Difficulties With Observation Location,"Throughout introductory physics, students create and interpret free body diagrams in which multiple forces act on an object, typically at a single location (the objects center of mass).  The situation increases in difficulty when multiple objects are involved, and further when electric and magnetic fields are present. In the latter, sources of the fields are often identified as a set of electric charges or current-carrying wires, and students are asked to determine the electric or magnetic field at a separate location defined as the observation location. Previous research suggests students struggle with accounting for how a measurement or calculation depends on the observation location. We present preliminary results exploring the extent to which students struggle with observation location by analyzing student written work of problems involving vector addition of fields. This analysis is further supported by relevant episodes of classroom video from a studio-style, algebra-based, introductory electricity and magnetism course.",Jaime Bryant,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6260,DePaul University,"Rita Dawod, Susan Fischer, Mary Bridget Kustusch",2015

We survey students using compiled questions from several existing questionnaires designed to measure student characteristics such as attitudes toward and motivations for learning physics, organization of scientific knowledge, experiences outside the classroom, and demographics. Other studies have identified five distinct learning profiles across varying student populations. Using a person-centered approach, we utilize cluster analysis methods to group students into learning profiles to better understand the study strategies and motives of algebra-based studio physics students. We present results from first-semester and second-semester studio-mode introductory physics courses across three universities. We identify these five distinct learning profiles and investigate demographics and concept inventory performance within and across them.

6274,Contributed Poster Presentation,Exploring the effectiveness of problem diagrams using AB experiments in a MOOC.,"Recent study shows that providing a problem diagram can hurt students performance as it reduces the incentive for students to draw their own. We report 6 controlled AB experiments in a MOOC, comparing students performance and diagram drawing behavior in a total sample of 12 problem pairs. Removing the diagram makes a quarter of the problems slightly more difficult for low and medium skilled students, but often very significantly increases the likelihood of all students to draw their own diagram. We found that students of different skill levels made similar deliberate choices for each problem about whether to draw a diagram. Diagrams influence outcomes mostly in problems that involve ideal physics objects (e.g. blocks and pulleys) and those involving spatially and temporally complex real-life situations.  Apparently in most cases removing the problem diagram encourages diagram drawing without materially affecting students chances of answering it correctly.",Saif Rayyan,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6274,MIT Physics,"Zhongzhou Chen, MIT Physics

While discussing assessment goals for student understanding of acceleration, two of the teachers held opposing models about the implications of the sign of acceleration on the direction of an objects motion and whether it is speeding up or slowing down. Failing to resolve the inconsistency between their individual models, the resultant assessment item was such that both models would provide the same correct response, albeit for different reasons. The potential for correct answers for incorrect reasons perpetuated ambiguity into its classroom use as a formative measure of student understanding.

Students engage in the activity, experimenting with the electrostatic phenomena simulated in the game, prior to receiving formal instruction. We argue that students engaging in a game that is designed to explore the electric field can gain experiences with simulated electrostatic phenomena and draw upon increasingly sophisticated understandings of the electric field. These experiences could eventually be useful for their later learning of electrostatics. We analyzed classroom videos and in this paper present a case study about the group mentioned above. The results show that students drew upon their understandings of the electric field, progressed through the increasingly difficult levels of the game, overcame the tensions in the activity, and gained experiences with the simulated electrostatic phenomena.",Ying Cao,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6233,Tutfts University,"B�rbara M.

Instructor feedback, can be a powerful tool used to affect student self-regulation. Furthermore, constructivist-learning theory suggests that strong self-regulators are more efficient learners. Thus, instructors may be able to positively influence students construction of knowledge by providing grader assessment feedback (GAF) that affects student self-regulation. I compared three different types of GAF used in introductory physics courses and investigated how students use of each GAF impacts student self-regulation. I present preliminary results from a quasi-experimental study indicating whether or not students use GAF and how their use of GAF affects student self-regulation.

However, solutions that break from these frameworks may embody a commonly unmeasured aspect of physics problem-solving expertise: use of conceptual shortcuts to minimize mathematical computations.  Adopting an approach from Heckler (2009), we show that prompting introductory physics students to draw free-body diagrams before solving force problems decreases the use of conceptual shortcuts and increases reproduction of standard procedures.  Extending this paradigm, students were then asked to evaluate an informal solution for a force problem.  When the problem text included a diagram prompt, students rated the informal solution less favorably, commenting that the solution was not formal enough.  These results imply that the prompt to draw a diagram not only cues procedural problem-solving approaches, but also pushes students away from informal approaches that could demonstrate problem-solving expertise.",Eric Kuo,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6198,Stanford University,"Nicole R.

In this paper, we compare the effect of two different generation activities on student learning of a buoyancy principle.

In the other condition, to generate the rule, students can more freely explore the phenomenon using an interactive simulation.  83 community college students participated in the study. Students in the representative cases condition generated more complete rules and performed significantly better in solving buoyancy problems.

While our analysis corroborates previous findings concerning the role that science identity can play, our analysis sheds new light on ways in which topical interest and classroom dynamics can also foster transformative experiences.

In this study, 30-45 minute interviews about plane waves were conducted with nine upper-level science/engineering majors, all of whom had previously taken courses in electromagnetic theory where plane waves were invoked.  The interviews revealed several aspects of how students struggle to move between conceptual and mathematical representations of plane waves.  Examples include a disconnect between 1-D and 3-D waves (relating to 1-D physically but 3-D only mathematically),  an inability to articulate how the mathematical form dictates planar iso-surfaces, and the challenge of interpreting multiple types of vectors (e.g. E-fields and wavevectors) drawn in the same diagram.",Andrew Berger,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6220,University of Rochester,,2015

In a previous study, students in a SQILab course were compared to students in the same course but without the SQILab framework. Both groups of students conducted an identical physics experiment to determine the index of refraction of a piece of Plexiglass. Students in the SQILab course demonstrated more critical thought on their measurements and data than the control group, but were still unlikely to resolve systematic effects or use comparisons to motivate improving their data. In this study, we implemented several recommendations from the previous work with a new cohort of students and evaluated their performance on the same experiment to answer the questions posed by the previous study. The results from this new evaluation is very indicative of the efficacy of the SQILab.",Dhaneesh Kumar,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6327,University of British Columbia,"N. G.

6192,Contributed Poster Presentation,Investigating Minute Papers to Assess Scientific Reasoning,"One-minute papers, also known as exit tickets, are a formative assessment strategy that asks students to respond to one or two short-answer prompts following an in-class lesson.  Typically, the prompts ask students to identify a key take-home lesson and a question or confusion they have about the lesson.  Students' responses help instructors gauge students' understanding and engagement in the class.  We  investigate how coding such regular, brief post-class reflections for sophistication of reasoning can provide a useful proxy measure of aggregate student engagement and growth in critical thinking in a general-education physics class.  In future work, we plan to investigate using automated methods to statistically code aggregate levels of scientific reasoning in large-enrollment classes.",Carolyn Sealfon,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6192,Princeton University,,2015

We examine the possibility that this failure may stem from a lack of understanding of the inner product, in particular, how to determine the inner product of functions represented graphically. We have found that some students are unable to find the inner product of graphical functions in contexts outside of quantum mechanics.

Entanglement played an important role in the development of the foundations of the theory, and makes possible modern applications in quantum information technology including teleportation, quantum computing and cryptography. 
We have investigated student understanding of two-particle quantum entanglement at the introductory and advanced undergraduate levels. We collected student activity responses using two versions of an interactive QuVis simulation ""Entanglement: The nature of quantum correlations"" (www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/quvis/simulations_html5/sims/entanglement/entanglement.html) and carried out a small number of student interviews. 
Common incorrect ideas found in this work include stating that all entangled states must be maximally entangled (i.e. show perfect correlations or anticorrelations), that the spins of particles in a product state have definite values (are not in a superposition state with respect to spin) and difficulty factorizing product states. Outcomes from this work will inform further development of the QuVis Entanglement simulation.",Antje Kohnle,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6151,University of St Andrews,"Erica Deffebach, University of St Andrews",2015

Physics education research has often found that students have great difficulty transferring knowledge from one context to another. We examine upper-level and graduate students facility with questions about the interference pattern in the double-slit experiment with single photons and polarizers in various orientations placed in front of one or both slits. Answering these questions correctly in the context of the double-slit experiment requires transfer of knowledge of concepts students had learned in the context of a tutorial on Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) with single photons and polarizers in various paths of MZI.

These two meanings of conservation typically remain disconnected from each other and can appear contradictory, even after instruction. In an effort to support teachers in building robust understandings of energy from their existing knowledge, I designed a study to investigate the productive ideas in K-12 teachers conversations about energy.

6112,Contributed Poster Presentation,Physics Learning Facilitates Enhanced Resting-State Brain Connectivity in Problem-Solving Network,"Modeling how students think about physics is often measured via observation of students solving physics problems [1]. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may inform how these processes occur, but currently no neuroimaging studies have examined how students develop physics problem-solving skills. To provide insight into the neural nature of physics learning we conducted a meta-analysis identifying the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) as the region most consistently implicated across problem-solving tasks. We then examined resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in brain regions supporting problem-solving. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired pre/post instruction in 7 undergraduate, first-time enrollees in introductory physics. Correspondence between post-instruction rsFC and meta-analytic results suggests a semester of university physics may facilitate enhanced recruitment of posterior brain regions involved in reasoning. Increased IFG-correlated activity from pre to post instruction indicates intrinsic brain connectivity may be modulated as a result of educational experience.

The goals of the program were to get our physics students (from mostly science and engineering majors) to think creatively about how to demonstrate basic physics concepts, how to teach these concepts to education majors and elementary school students, to expose our student population to a diverse and often challenging environment, and to hopefully get the physics students to think about future careers in education.  Our students mostly find the experience to be fun, non-threatening, and report it invigorated their love of science.  We report on the results from student surveys and reflections.",Adria C.

To study this phenomenon, we examined the Physics BS program at Purdue University over the matriculating classes between 1990 and 2010.  Purdue University offers several physics degrees: BS in Physics (Honors and regular), BS in Applied Physics (Honors and Regular), and BS in Physics Education.  Over this 20 year period, the number of physics majors has greatly increased. However, this does not seem to be the case for female and other underrepresented minorities.  By studying the progression of the matriculating and graduating Physics classes, we hope to determine potential trends in transferring or post-graduation paths across the different demographics and physics majors.",Megan Harwell,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6328,"Department of Physics and Astronomy, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN","Scott Franklin, Department of Physics, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY

6255,Contributed Poster Presentation,Physics students' epistemological framings for a conceptual test question,"Quality assessment is important in physics education. However, it can be challenging to construct assessments measuring students understanding of concepts and elicit deeper levels of cognition during problem solving.  Tests are common assessments, but students assume test questions will have a numeric or symbolic answer. This study analyzes test responses and reflections on a question without a numeric or symbolic answer from a calculus-based physics class.  Though designed to test conceptual understanding, it was largely unsuccessful due to students assumptions that a numeric answer was needed. We analyzed students responses and short reflections on the problem by looking at ways students tried to solve the problem and their uncertainties when confronted by a non-traditional test question. Using a framework of epistemological framing, we found that students used a variety of framings to pursue a solution; though common patterns emerge that can inform instructors and physics education researchers.",Tyler D.

To study reasoning in a simple context we pilot tested short, dichotomous classification questions.   These questions present students with a physical situation and ask for classification as possible or impossible, followed by a logical justification and several Likert scale self-assessments.   The questions require reasoning, but can be figured out with one key idea, and one or two logical steps. We developed 16 questions and tested them in clinical interviews with 22 undergraduate students who have studied algebra-based or calculus-based physics through electricity and magnetism.   Using qualitative and quantitative analysis we seek evidence that these questions can help identify differences in reasoning with physics ideas along with strategies for using the questions to produce testable hypotheses about how subtle differences in questions can impact student reasoning.

A preliminary categorization of student attitudes towards a lab group coordinated problem solving exercise, in which students individually reflect on their group-based problem attempt, is based upon students written interpretations about the usefulness of the exercise: respectively towards intrinsic value of a problem solving framework, towards performing well in the course, and towards less specific aspects of the exercise.  The relationship between choice of major and this preliminary categorization for a typical algebra-based physics course is analyzed, as are trends by major and by category type in several measures of class performance.

We study the NFW using a real-time professional development observation tool and case study analysis. We show how the tool allows workshop leaders to formatively assess the prevalence of lecture and what goals could plausibly be met through their workshop design. We also analyze faculty engaging in a task as physics students, and find that their interactions poorly represent what we would like them to foster in their own classrooms.

However, looking at students involvement in their courses beyond the classroom reveals hidden dynamics factoring into students learning. Course Networking (CN) is a course management system (CMS) designed to provide a medium for students to engage socially/academically outside of the classroom. In our study, we utilized both qualitative and quantitative research techniques to evaluate each students engagement outside of the course.  By comparing this evaluation to the students respective grades we hope to determine if there is any correlation between CN use and final course grade.",Brian May,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6211,Purdue University,Rebecca Lindell; Andrew Hirsch; Andrew Gavrin,2015

With a large number of student responses compiled (N=443), we conducted an analysis of student written work to identify student ideas and trends in student difficulties.  Here, we present our examination of student responses to one CCMI question that targets vector decomposition in multiple coordinate systems. Through iterative and cooperative efforts to hand-code student responses, we identified common patterns in students final expressions, resulting in broad categories. We identified approaches to the problem inferred from features of student solutions. For example, when decomposing a velocity vector in a Cartesian coordinate system, we found that students either differentiated a position vector or used trigonometry to visualize the components. We observed that certain approaches more commonly resulted in particular errors. Investigating productive student approaches is a step towards pedagogical improvement.",Anna M Turnbull,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6148,Michigan State University,"Leanne Doughty (2), Vashti Sawtelle (1,2), and Marcos D.

6280,Contributed Poster Presentation,Student Metacognitive Knowledge about Salient Distracting Features in Physics Problems,"Student reasoning on physics problems is often context dependent, and students may reason very differently when answering analogous questions targeting the same concept. A possible explanation is that salient distracting features (SDFs) in physics problems may cue students spontaneous reasoning.  Students often accept this cued reasoning without question, even though it may be unproductive and preclude the use of relevant knowledge.  Research suggests that strengthening students metacognitive skills may help address these difficulties, although little work has focused on the role that metacognitive knowledge can play in student reasoning. This paper describes preliminary results from an interview-based instructional intervention aimed not only at developing students metacognitive knowledge of SDFs and the role SDFs may play in cueing reasoning but also how this knowledge can be applied. Preliminary results suggest students are able to identify SDFs and associated reasoning in physics problems, but struggle to recognize the productiveness of this endeavor.",Thanh K.

To address these issues, we conducted a controlled experiment at the introductory level to help students practice the construction and explore the physical meaning of differentials. This between-students design featured pairs of similarly-styled training tasks that varied by physical context, either on paper without feedback or on a computer with electronic feedback. The training contexts included kinematics (e.g., Velocity vs. Time), dynamics (e.g., Force vs. Position), gases, and mass densities.

Using free-response conceptual questions in an algebra-based introductory physics course, we found that even pre-instruction, students can rank the types of light on the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., X-rays, microwaves, etc.) in terms of their energy and frequency. They appear to draw on knowledge from personal experience, as well as previous classes, to justify their claims. However, we also see evidence that some students connect light energy to kinetic energy and therefore, claim that different types of light travel at different speeds. This is despite often explicitly stating that all travel at the speed of light. These results are consistent with the knowledge-in-pieces framework that claims that students may have correct pieces of knowledge, but may inappropriately apply them in certain contexts or may not reconcile conflicting ideas.",Lorne Nash,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6240,DePaul University,"Dr. Mary Bridget Kustusch, Dr. Susan M Fischer",2015

Our aim was to investigate the concept of student ownership in the context of an upper-division optical physics laboratory course in which students spend the final seven weeks of the semester working in groups on a final project of their choosing. We've drawn on two data sources: (1) results of the Survey on Project Ownership, administered at the end of the course and (2) weekly student reflections about their goals, challenges, and successes. Our analysis probes connections between student ownership and other relevant aspects of the final project experience, including student affect, agency, and self-efficacy as well as their interactions with peers and instructors.

6197,Contributed Poster Presentation,The Use of Representations in Evidence-Based and Non-Evidence-Based Physics Activities,"Representations such as graphs, pictures, words, and equations play a crucial role in the pedagogy of introductory physics.  Activities such as labs and tutorials often require students to analyze and produce these representations.  We investigate the use of representations in a variety of activities.  Specifically, we examine both labs and tutorials as well as both evidence-based and non-evidence-based activities.  We define evidence-based activities as those that have been connected with positive learning outcomes in published research articles.  Our evidenced-based activities are inspired by physics education research, while our non-evidence-based activities are more traditional.  We compare and contrast the use of representations among these types of activities.  We investigate several uses of representations, including representations produced by the student; representations provided by the activity; and representations that the student re-examines at a later point in the activity.",Joshua Von Korff,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6197,Georgia State University,"Chang Zhan - Georgia State University

6027,Contributed Poster Presentation,The benefits of giving feedback:  investigating student exchanges over PeerWise,"Encouraging students to write their own multiple-choice questions is a valuable academic exercise, placing high cognitive demands on the learner.  Students must be able to synthesize course materials to construct a question, provide plausible distractors (wrong answers) and explain their answers.

A popular online question generation application is PeerWise. PeerWise enables students to provide feedback to question authors in the form of comments. Providing feedback encourages students to think critically about their peers? submissions; to problem solve by suggesting possible improvements; and to reflect upon their own performance in light of these processes, enhancing their understanding.

Three main research questions are addressed:

1.    What types of comments do students write?
2.    Which type of comment is most strongly associated with exam
       performance?
3.    Is writing high quality comments associated with exam

Students in different years taking physics lab course in our teaching lab were all encouraged to complete the questionnaire. 
We report on the initial results based on the samples collected this semester. Students specialty, year as well as the gender will be taken as parameters to divide students into groups. Analysis will be carried out to see the common and diverse attitudes among these groups.

6209,Contributed Poster Presentation,The use of epistemic distancing to create a safe space to sensemake in physics tutorials,"In active engagement physics classrooms, such as the Tutorials in Physics Sensemaking, students get opportunities to make sense of physics together.  They do not always take up these opportunities, in part because of the risk of sharing their ideas and having them rejected by their classmates or the instructors.  We analyze video of three tutorial groups to investigate how students manage these risks in creating a safe space to sensemake.  We find that the students and instructors alike rely on a common discursive resource  epistemic distancing  to share their ideas while protecting themselves affectively if others disagree.  Epistemic distancing includes hedging, joking, deferring, and other discourse moves used to soften ones stance in conversation.  We use video analysis to illustrate the effects of these moves on tutorial groups sensemaking discussions, and discuss implications for instructors wishing to encourage sensemaking discussions in their physics classrooms.",Luke D.

Because collaborative learning is inherently a social activity, we apply Network Analysis methods to examine student social interactions within the classroom using a survey administered periodically in class. We then calculate centrality, a family of measures that quantify how connected or central a particular student is within the classroom social network. In order to understand what centrality means in this context, we investigate the relationship among centrality, student demographics, and student outcomes in a large-scale MI classroom with 70 students and 6 instructors. We address two research questions: Does centrality depend on sex, ethnicity, incoming GPA, or FMCE pre-score? and Does centrality predict final grade in course or FMCE post-score?",Eric Williams,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6254,Florida International University,"Eric Brewe, Justyna Zwolak, Remy Dou",2015

Towards this instructional goal, we seek to unpack the nuanced and dynamic nature of student ontologies. We examine video data from a focus group of students enrolled in our transformed Modern Physics for Engineers course at the University of Colorado Boulder that explicitly addresses interpretation of quantum phenomena. We analyze a student discussion about the nature of photons using the conceptual blending framework of Fauconnier and Turner (2002). We find that in the discussion, classical ontologies of particles and waves act as input spaces from which a new blended space of photon emerges; this blend incorporates the transfer of some particle and wave properties to a new entity. When elaborating on these blended concepts, the students engage in metacognitive thinking as they negotiate the emergent meaning surrounding their ideas.",Jessica Hoy,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6200,"Department of Physics, University of Colorado Boulder","Kathleen Hinko (Department of Physics, University of Colorado Boulder), Noah Finkelstein (Department of Physics, University of Colorado Boulder)",2015

However, most of the work with these constructs uses traditional psychology large-N quantitative studies to show that change happens without describing in qualitative detail the mechanism by which it happens. This presentation will focus on a case study of a student who sees herself as competent in neuroscience, identifies as a math person, but still places physics in a category of special difficulty. Evidence from this case suggests receiving grade-based evidence of her capability in physics is insufficient for impacting her self-beliefs in physics.

In this talk we begin to unpack this variability, exploring why some life science examples may be more successful than others at sparking and sustaining student interest. By analyzing data from (1) survey instruments assessing student interest in particular life science examples, and (2) interviews conducted with students before and after instruction, we identify features of our IPLS course that appear to be particularly important for fostering student engagement. We suggest that some of these features might also foster student interest in more traditional introductory physics courses.",Benjamin D.

6277,Contributed Poster Presentation,Validating the pre/post-test in a MOOC environment,"A standard method for measuring learning is to administer the same assessment before and after instruction. This pre/post-test technique is widely used in education research and has been used in our introductory physics MOOC to measure learning. One potential weakness of this paradigm is that post-test performance gains may result from exposure on the pre-test instead of instruction. This possibility is exacerbated in MOOCs where students receive multiple attempts per item, instant correct/incorrect feedback, and unlimited time until the due date. To find the size of this problem in our recent MOOCs, we split the student population into two groups, each of which received identical post-tests but different subsets of post-test items on their group pre-test. We report a small overall advantage (6.8% � 4.1%) on post-test items due to pre-test exposure.

Introductory physics textbooks variably use the terms net, total or resultant when referring to a vector sum, with some textbooks using these terms interchangeably. In particular, we have shown that students distinguish between the concepts of net force and total force, and the concepts of net momentum and total momentum. Phase two of this research has been to analyse the reasons students give for making these distinctions. Using an approach suggested by Grounded Theory, free responses from 400 freshmen have been analyzed and broad trends of reasoning have been identified.

6000,Parallel session: Custom Format,Bridging educational research and practice: Supporting Undergraduate Research Experiences in physics,"Undergraduate research experiences have been recognized as a significant contributor to students more central participation in physics.  In this session we will synthesize research on undergraduate research experiences with programmatic perspective of practitioners.  The first half of the session will be short talks. Leaders in scaffolding undergraduate students experiences in research will present overviews of their programs, emphasizing their central design principles. Programs featured here take equity and sense of belonging as central foci for their efforts.  Educational researchers will present key takeaways from their work on investigating students experiences with scientific research.  The second half of the session will be a fishbowl discussion where audience questions will guide a dialogue with our speakers.  Our goals are to give participants the opportunity to learn from both researcher and practitioner perspectives, support generative dialogue and feedback across these perspectives, and work toward design principles for supporting undergraduate research experiences.",Gina Quan,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6000,University of Maryland,"Chandra Turpen <chandra.turpen@gmail.com>, University of Maryland",2015
6003,Parallel session: Custom Format,Teaching measurement and uncertainty,"While measurement and uncertainty are core elements of the physics enterprise, the way they are incorporated into undergraduate curricula varies greatly. This can range from simply noting significant figures to teaching aspects of the technical formalism. In general, however, research has indicated that students do not appreciate the nature and role of uncertainty. (Unusually for physics two different paradigms are taught (frequentist versus probabilistic) with distinctly different epistemologically interpretations). The Talk&Work session will consist of (a) short Talks summarizing the present situation and (b) inputs from participants in a consultative Workshop format. The overall aim of the session is to identify research questions that need answering in order to meet the challenges with regard to both teaching and practice on the one hand, and student understanding on the other. Participants are asked to bring a summary of current practices with regard to teaching measurement and uncertainty in their own institutions.",Saalih Allie,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6003,University of Cape Town,TBA,2015
6009,Parallel session: Poster Symposium,Student learning with PhET simulations:  Beyond conceptual gains in classroom settings,"PhET simulations are widely used in high school and college physics classes, but only limited research has explored students thinking and learning when interacting with the simulations.  In this raucous structured poster session, we explore students cognition and learning when using PhET simulations, in ways that go beyond documenting conceptual gains from collaborative active learning. By doing so, we hope to bring together creative approaches to studying conceptual, epistemological, and affective aspects of students thinking and learning when using PhET sims, sparking discussions of how to push this research forward.  After a brief introduction to the session, participants will cycle through a subset of the posters.   Then, the Discussant will comment on the posters in provocative ways designed to spur a fruitful discussion during the rest of the session.",Andrew Elby,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6009,University of Maryland,Eric Kuo,2015
6002,Parallel session: Talk Symposium,Disentangling Student Reasoning from Conceptual Understanding,"Improving student reasoning skills is a goal of many physics courses. Students in majors other than physics are frequently required to take physics not for specific course content, but rather for the problem solving and reasoning skills they are expected to develop. To solve qualitative and quantitative problems in physics, students must be able to chain together a succession of ideas leading to a prediction or inference. A recent report [NRC 2013] describes the promotion of reasoning abilities as a longstanding focus of PER that remains an important area of inquiry. In many cases, however, the assessment of student ability to construct reasoning chains is closely tied to the investigation of students conceptual understanding of a specific topic. This session will present three talks that focus on emerging research methods and theoretical constructs used to investigate student reasoning in a way that transcends the understanding of specific physics content.",Beth Lindsey,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6002,Penn State Greater Allegheny,,2015
6011,Parallel session: Talk Symposium,New developments in high school labs,"This session is dedicated to the discussion of the new developments in high school physics labs. Specifically, we will focus on the changes that are occurring in the laboratory instruction due to the NGSS and the revisions of AP courses. We will also present examples of collaboration between universities and high schools in the area of instructional laboratories and its effects on student learning. Presenters in the session are high school physics teachers and university faculty.",Eugenia Etkina,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6011,Rutgers University,,2015
6010,Parallel session: Talk Symposium,Research methodologies in Laboratory Contexts,"Research in laboratory contexts is less common than research in classroom contexts, but just as important.  Labs are where students learn vital experimentation, metacognitive, and problem-posing skills; where they try on identities as research scientists, and interact with scientific equipment.  The four projects in this session investigate student learning in laboratory contexts with wildly differing research questions and methodologies.  While some projects take the development of experimentation and bench skills as core to their research, others merely use labs as a context for broader questions of student development.  Each research team will briefly present their project to situate an interactive discussion of methods and goals of research in laboratory settings.",Eleanor C.

6008,Parallel session: Talk Symposium,Research on student conceptions of integration in math and physics,"Integration is a complex mathematical idea that has multiple meanings and layers. An in-depth knowledge of definite and indefinite integrals is extremely important to understanding various physics concepts and being able to solve relevant problems. This session includes researchers in both mathematics and physics education who have conducted investigations into the teaching and learning of integrals, primarily definite integrals.  Common themes in the presented work are student understanding of the Riemann sum, the interplay between the mathematics and the physics across multiple contexts, and indeed the role of context itself.",Michael Loverude,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6008,California State University - Fullerton,"Warren M.

The speakers will describe their approaches to creating a design-based laboratory experience, and each talk will focus on a different element of the lab, such as student affect, scaffolding of lab skills, assessment and self-assessment, and long-term learning gains. Each of these elements are crucial in creating a productive and positive experience for the student. The talks will be followed by a discussion in which the audience is invited to participate.",Katerina Visnjic,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6015,Princeton University,,2015
6006,Parallel session: Workshop,Data-centered teacher professional development,"We present four activities that are common to professional development activities in the Maine Physical Sciences Partnership (MainePSP) (NSF MSP-0962805). In these activities, we emphasize content knowledge, knowledge of students' ideas, and discussion of the pedagogical strategies which best address student needs while building on student strengths. Our workshop will focus on the teaching and learning of mechanical energy and accelerated motion. In our professional development workshops with teachers, we use student data as anchors for discussion - what do we, as teachers, need to know in order to answer these questions, think about our students' thinking, and respond in the classroom? In this PERC workshop, we use a parallel structure in which the data we discuss were gathered during teacher professional development activities to engage PERC workshop participants in discussions of teacher knowledge of content, students, pedagogy, and the overall structure of MainePSP professional development design",Michael C.

6005,Parallel session: Workshop,Examining metacognition and epistemology in introductory labs: Video Workshop,"The purpose of this active-participation workshop is to generate community discussion on what students metacognition and epistemological cognition might look like in introductory physics labs, how can we as researchers identify these constructs in video data of students engaged in laboratory activities, implications we can draw about lab-based teaching and learning through such investigation, and implications for current and future work within PER. The video-data in this workshop comes from a single group of 4 students working on a 2-week lab in an introductory physics course for life science majors. During the workshop participants will break into small groups of 6-8 to view and analyze segments of the video. Through moderated discussions within and between the small groups, we hope to further the conversation within PER about the constructs of metacognition and epistemology, specifically as they apply to laboratory settings.",Ayush Gupta,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6005,"University of Maryland, College Park","Andrew Elby, University of Maryland, College Park, MD

6013,Plenary,Challenges and opportunities for measuring student outcomes of undergraduate research,"Inherent in the practice of apprentice-model undergraduate research (UR) is a fundamental tension between the educational goals of UR and its basis in faculty scholarship.  This tension leads to challenges for faculty in guiding student researchers in their daily work and in positioning their own UR work within institutionally bifurcated domains of teaching and research.  It also generates a disconnect when it comes to measuring the outcomes of UR.  Traditional outcome measures emphasize students career outcomes and research productivity, while education research has documented students personal and professional learning from UR, including new skills and understandings of disciplinary inquiry, growth in confidence and responsibility, and scientific identity development. Thus far, self-report measures including surveys and interviews have dominated this young body of research.  I will discuss why assessing the outcomes of apprentice-model undergraduate research is inherently difficult, outline the strengths and limitations of the approaches tried to date, and suggest areas for future research.",Sandra Laursen,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6013,"Ethnography & Evaluation Research, University of Colorado Boulder",,2015
6021,Plenary,Developing quantitative critical thinking in the introductory physics laboratory,"While the goals for instructional labs have been highly debated, inquiry- and skills-driven labs can lead to significant gains in students' scientific and experimentation abilities. A simple scaffold for introductory labs uses iterative cycles of comparisons to develop students' epistemologies, experimentation behaviours, and critical thinking abilities. By focusing the iterations on improving measurements, students explore the limits of physical models in the real world and engage in the evaluation and refinement of these models. In a controlled research study, students adopted these behaviours and continued to use them even after instruction to do so had been removed.",Natasha Holmes,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6021,Stanford University,,2015
6020,Plenary,The challenge of implementing education research: A holistic and dynamical systems perspective,"I believe that there is gap between the results of PER and their classroom implementation. I am concerned about this gap and how to close it. I will talk about what I see are two major challenges to implementing PER most effectively in physics classrooms. (1) Integration: We lack a good model the classroom as a complex dynamical system. (2) Transformation: Transformation or change is difficult and uncomfortable for both students and instructor. In exploring the ideas of integration and transformation, I will try to paint a portrait of my own physics classroom and talk about key components of the physics classroom as a complex system model, including integrating experiments into the classroom setting, the growth of a learning community, and the role of formative assessment and reflection. I will also tell a story of my own personal transformation as an educator and describe the transformative experience that my students undergo. In reflecting on these transformations, I have come to one inescapable conclusion: Real change comes with change in personal orientation for the learner towards learning, and for a teacher towards teaching. The key shift is not in the world, but in the self.",David Brookes,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6020,Florida International University,,2015
6012,Plenary,What does a vision for k-12 Science education have to do with PER?,"""The Framework for k-12 Science Education"" (NRC, 2012),  produced by an NRC  committee which I chaired, delineates a vision of science education as ""three dimensional"" in that a set of science and engineering practices and a set of cross-cutting concepts are defined and given equal importance to a set of core disciplinary ideas in defining what all students should learn about science in the course of their k-12 schooling.  This vision was developed based on, but extrapolating from, research on learning, chiefly work done with younger students, but also insights extracted from some discipline-based education research at the college level. The assumption was made that the learning needs of students in broad introductory college level courses and those in high school courses are not fundamentally different. Conversely, aspects of this vision can be applied to ask questions about physics education at the college as well as at the high school level. In particular, research questions abound about how to engage students in science and engineering practices (both in laboratory courses and in research experience settings) and the value of doing so. Likewise one can study the value of teaching students to use cross-cutting concepts as lenses to think about questions that may be powerful and productive when confronted with new phenomena to explain or problems to solve. I contend that the lists of these practices and concepts developed for k-12 can inform and guide thinking about science teaching and research on learning at the college level, particularly as one investigates how to design an undergraduate physics education program that better serves the needs of all students, including those not headed for research careers in physics or related sciences.",Helen R.

6288,Symposium Poster,Are simulations better than hands-on activities?  The wrong question,"In an experimental study, we compared community college students engaged in learning the physical relationships of two physical systems, using either PhET simulations or hands-on physical environments.  In both activities, the best predictor of learning was a type of strategy that consisted of experimental manipulations that (1) followed a control of variable strategy (CVS), (2) occurred with a delay between experiments, and (3) targeted particularly difficult relationships that the participants were less familiar with. For one physical system, this strategy was more common in the simulation condition, whereas for the other system it was more common in the hands-on condition. From this, we argue that future research should focus on understanding productive learning strategies and mechanisms supported by different learning environments, not just on which environment is best.",Engin Bumbacher,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6288,Stanford University,Shima Salehi and Carl Wieman,2015
6290,Symposium Poster,"Can students learn from simulations at home, alone?","Most previous work on student learning with PhET simulations focuses on classroom environments where students work in groups, with scaffolding from both worksheets and instructors.  By contrast, our study with high school students demonstrates that they can learn from simulations when working independently, both in class and at home, when using appropriately scaffolded worksheets. These results, triangulated with those of Ives et al. (see below), should spark discussion about when and how PhET simulations can support student learning.",Wendy Adams,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6290,University of Northern Colorado,,2015
6292,Symposium Poster,Framings of  PhET manipulations:  Investigating mechanism vs. confirming answers,"Our tutorial for the Gas Properties PhET tried to engage students in repeated cycles of (i) making a prediction using the ideal gas law about what would happen to the pressure of a gas during a given process such as an isothermal compression, (ii) investigating the microscopic mechanism of the physical process using the PhET, and finally (iii) reconciling the mathematical and microscopic stories.  Sometimes, observed interactions among students and between students and the simulation environment mediated by the tutorial worksheet were about Investigating Mechanism, attending to the motion of the molecules, particularly collisions, to describe bulk pressure and temperature changes in the gas.  In other moments, however, when addressing step (ii), observed interactions were about Confirmation, checking that the pressure increased or decreased as they mathematically predicted in step (i) but not attending to the molecular story. Our poster explores these framings of PhET use, our instructional response, and implications for other groups designing PhET-based tutorials.",Vijay Kaul,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6292,University of Maryland,Ayush Gupta and Andrew Elby,2015
6289,Symposium Poster,Teaching and assessing scientific inquiry strategies using PhET simulations,"In this study, we used PhET simulations to teach 100 8th-grade students to use one of two inquiry strategies for discovering relations between variables.  Half of the students were taught to use a deductive approach, the Control of Variables Strategy (CVS), while the other half were taught a more inductive approach we call the General Principle Strategy (GPS).  After eight class sessions, students completed a strategy transfer task, as well as a simulation-based assessment using the Balance Act PhET.  We found that students who used their previously-learned  strategy on the transfer task were more likely to discover the multivariate relation of torque, as measured by performance on the Balance Act.  This research highlights the potential of PhET simulations not only as tools for inquiry instruction, but also as assessments of the inquiry process.",Luke Conlin,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6289,Stanford University,,2015
6291,Symposium Poster,Using PhET simulations as pre-lecture assignments to support knowledge consolidation,"The context for our study is a first-year Physics course. While the course takes place in Canada, all students are international, and this is their first year in an english-speaking institution. Students received a combination of pre-reading assignments and PhET activities to prepare them for learning on the topics of friction and torque. Students worked with the simulations once during the second week of the term and once towards its end. The given activities asked students to explore key concepts in the target domain and reflect on their exploration. Results show that students engaged with the simulations productively, even in a homework setting without instructor support. Furthermore, short interaction with the sim was sufficient to improve students' performance from pre- to post-test. Last, students' attitudes towards exploration remained remarkably stable form the first homework assignment to the second one, a couple of months later.",Joss Ives,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6291,University of British Columbia,"Georg Rieger, Nikki Yee, Hillgan Ma, Deborah Butler, and Ido Roll",2015
6318,Symposium Talk,A Holistic Approach to Reforming Lab-Based Curricula in Cornell University's Materials Science and Engineering Department,"Core Materials Science and Engineering courses at Cornell contain a laboratory component starting in the sophomore year. This intensifies in junior year, where the laboratory component associated with four core junior year courses is consolidated in a two-semester Junior Lab course. Seniors choose between Senior Thesis or Senior Lab. Within the past few years, the department has begun taking a holistic approach to laboratory curriculum by working towards scaffolding lab skill development across the undergraduate curriculum. This talk will overview these measures and focus on the current effort to transform the Junior Lab course from a set of disconnected labs to a series of activities through which students hone their skills for conducting experiments, thoughtfully analyzing data, performing error analyses, and writing high quality lab reports. Finally, the transformation of Senior Lab into a team-based, authentic research experience will be briefly presented.",Julie Nucci,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6318,Cornell University,,2015
6310,Symposium Talk,Advanced Lab as a Community of Practice,"We use the theory of Communities of Practice and the concept of Accountable Disciplinary Knowledge to describe how a learning community develops in the context of an upper-division physics laboratory course.   The change in accountable disciplinary knowledge motivates students' enculturation into a community of practice. The enculturation process is facilitated by four specific structural features of the course and supported by a primary instructional choice.  We don't focus on the physics that students learn; rather we focus on how their interactions with each other and the equipment show classroom community development. We support our claims with video-based observations of laboratory classroom interactions and individual, semistructured interviews with students about their laboratory experiences and physics identity.",Paul W.

6296,Symposium Talk,Analyzing Inconsistencies in Student Reasoning Using Dual Process Theory,"A set of theoretical ideas, referred to broadly as dual process theory, asserts that human cognition relies on two largely independent thinking systems. The first is fast and intuitive, while the second is slow, logically deliberate, and effortful. A common, and particularly puzzling phenomenon has been a focus of an ongoing, collaborative investigation: introductory students often demonstrate competent reasoning on one task, but not on other, closely related tasks. In some cases, students may simply not possess the formal knowledge and skills necessary to arrive at a correct answer. In other cases, however, students may switch their cognitive mode, seeming to abandon the formal knowledge and skills in favor of (perhaps more appealing) intuitive ideas. In order to probe the nature of such inconsistencies, we developed a paired-question methodology that allows us to disentangle reasoning approaches from conceptual understanding and use dual process theory to account for the observed inconsistencies.

From the time the CIPT started keeping lending library statistics in 2005 through the end of the funding period in 2012, there were over 60,000 high school student uses of this lending library hardware nationwide. Survey data shows that teachers overwhelming agreed that participation in CIPT programs and use of CIPT labs improved teacher confidence, instructional practices, attitude toward teaching, and lab program quality. Teachers also reported that their students' confidence, learning, attitude, and course enjoyment increased by doing CIPT labs.

6317,Symposium Talk,Designing a lab course from the perspective of flow theory,"Creating an inquiry-based lab course, where students design their own experiments, can be a challenging task. It requires a delicate balance between difficulty of tasks and students skills and abilities. Here we describe an attempt of using the flow theory[1] for converting traditional lab course into ISLE design labs. We analyze students' feedback and revise the course within the flow theory framework. It appears to be a powerful tool for decreasing frustration often associated with open-ended labs, and for improving students attitude towards the labs. This method allows us to create an environment where students consider designing an experiment as a challenging but exciting activity.

The entire experience -- small group scientific activities and large group reflective discussions -- was videotaped and analyzed with an emergent coding framework. From the analysis came a number of interesting research questions. On the first full day of the program, the students collaboratively developed a sign for the word ``metacognition'' for which there is not a sign in American Sign Language. Three aspects of the ensuing discussion stood out: (1) how the instructor communicated expectations about decision making; (2) how the instructor promoted student-driven decision making rather than instructor-driven policy; and (3) one student's shifts in decision making behavior. Subsequent days raised the issue of student views on expertise, what traits they attributed to novices and experts, and how they saw themselves transitioning from novice to expert. In this presentation, we discuss the research approach taken to studying a rich laboratory-based environment that contained many elements foreign to the researchers (e.g. deaf/hard-of-hearing culture). We conclude by discussing implications of this research for activity-based physics instruction.",Corey Ptak,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6311,Rochester Institute of Technology,"Mary Bridget Kustusch, Eleanor C.

Research in physics education has reported students' lack of ability to transfer their calculus knowledge to physics problem solving.  We conducted group teaching/learning interviews with 13 students to investigate their reasoning in setting up integrals in the context of E&M.  We proposed a conceptual framework by integrating aspects of several theoretical constructs-mathematical resources, conceptual metaphors, and conceptual blending to help us understand student use of calculus concept in physics. The main contributions of this research include (1)  providing evidence for the existence of symbolic forms in students' reasoning about differentials and integrals, (2) identifying conceptual metaphors involved in student reasoning, (3) categorizing the different ways in which students integrate their mathematics and physics knowledge in the context of solving physics integration problems.",Dehui Hu,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6297,Rochester Institute of Technology,"N.

In its 2nd year, half of all 16 lab sections performed ISLE-inspired lab activities, while the remaining sections performed traditional lab activities. We strove for a random selection of students. To assess the effectiveness of the design labs, we conducted focus interviews of this year's students and continued interviewing last year's students. The primary questions are i) what are the long-term learning gains of the skills developed in design labs and ii) how is the lab experience of the students dependent on the instructor. We chose a variety of interviewees based on final first-semester grade, gender, and instructor. In this talk, we will describe in more detail the pedagogical approach used in the experimental sections and show results from the interviews.

6308,Symposium Talk,Modeling-Based Reasoning in the Upper-Division Physics Laboratory: Framework and Initial Results,"We review and extend existing frameworks on modeling to develop a new framework that describes model-based reasoning in upper-division physics labs. Constructing and using models are core scientific practices that have gained significant attention within K-12 and higher education. A significant feature of the new framework is that measurement tools (in addition to the physical system being studied) are subjected to the process of modeling. We designed a short laboratory activity and conducted think-aloud interviews with individual students to refine the framework and demonstrate its utility by identifying modeling-based reasoning in the laboratory.  When applied to the think-aloud interviews, the framework captures and differentiates students' model-based reasoning and helps identify areas of future research. A modeling perspective reframes many of the seemingly arbitrary technical details of measurement tools and apparatus as an opportunity for authentic and engaging scientific sense-making.",Benjamin M.

6299,Symposium Talk,Physics and calculus students' understanding of the definite integral using graphical representations,"Using written surveys and individual interviews administered in introductory calculus-based physics and multivariable calculus classes, we studied the extent to which the conceptual understanding of definite integrals affects the understanding of physics concepts that involve definite integrals. We also elicited specific difficulties that students have with definite integrals, particularly with graphical representations, including applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find the integral of a graphed function. One strong focus of this work was how students reasoned about integrals that yield a negative result.  We noticed student success invoking physical context to interpret certain aspects of definite integrals. Furthermore, we found that although students dominantly used area-under-the-curve reasoning, including unprompted invocation of the Riemann sum, when contemplating definite integrals, their reasoning was often not sufficiently deep to help think about negative definite integrals.",Rabindra R.

6307,Symposium Talk,"Research Methodologies for Studying Troubleshooting, Metacognition, and Modeling in Junior-Level Electronics Courses","Studying student learning in upper-division instructional laboratory settings requires tailoring research methodologies to the unique learning environments characteristic of these courses. As an example, we present our approach to a cross-institutional study of student troubleshooting in junior-level electronics courses. In this study, we conducted think-aloud interviews in which pairs of students were tasked with diagnosing and repairing a malfunctioning circuit. The resulting video data were examined to probe the relationship between students' troubleshooting strategies, metacognitive behaviors, and use of mathematical and conceptual models. In this session, we discuss our research methodology, paying particular attention to both preservation of ecological validity during data collection and application of existing theoretical frameworks to video data analyses. We further describe our application of, and preliminary results from, these methodologies to the specific context of troubleshooting as part of a broader effort to develop new frameworks for understanding problem solving in experimental physics settings.

6314,Symposium Talk,Starting an Inquiry Based Laboratory Exercise and the Science Practices,"This presentation will take participants through the introduction of an actual pre-lab session for a mid-year exercise that introduces students to elements of springs while using pre-developed concepts from kinematics, dynamics, and energy storage and transfer. After the introduction, key highlights from the AP Physics 1 and Physics 2 Science Practices will be identified that students would use within the context of such an experience. Connections to future units in oscillatory motion and mechanical waves from the AP Physics 1/2 Curriculum Framework will also be identified.",Jeff Funkhouser,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6314,Greenhill School,,2015
6316,Symposium Talk,Studying student engagement in science practices using their lab reports and lab reflections,"Science practices are an integral part of learning science. However, mastering such practices is a complicated process for high school students. Unfamiliarity with inquiry-based environment and open-ended problems that do not have one correct solution is often perceived as frustrating for these learners. How do students cope with these challenges and how long does it take them to become comfortable? We implemented ISLE labs that focus on the development of student scientific abilities in a highs school physics course during one academic year and collected data containing the descriptions of designed experiments and students reflections. The data allowed us to answer questions related to the development of science practices including time required for development of specific abilities as well as the level of proficiency. We also investigated the differences in individual and group reports and students' self-assessment and reflections.",Danielle Bugge,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6316,West Windsor-Plainsboro High School,"Eugenia Etkina, Rutgers University, Graduate School of Education",2015
6295,Symposium Talk,The Contours that Influence Reasoning,"One goal of science instruction is, at least implicitly, to improve students' ability to reason logically about physical phenomena, data, and scientific concepts and models. Here I discuss a way of describing the origins of student difficulties with reasoning using the analogy of a contoured terrain or boundary. Specifically, reasoning and decision making is often constrained by strong tendencies to, for example, reply quickly, use the most available information, and make unwitting assumptions and observations aligned with beliefs and experience. I will provide some data on several examples in the context of physics education. In one of the cases studied the results provide tantalizing implications on how to ""reshape the contours"" and generally improve some reasoning skills. However, in most cases it is not clear if or how one might be able to improve reasoning skills beyond the specific contexts in which the skills are practiced.",Andrew Heckler,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6295,The Ohio State University,,2015
6319,Symposium Talk,Using Students' Design Tasks to Develop Scientific Abilities,"To help students develop the scientific abilities desired in the 21st century workplace, four different types of student design tasks--observational, testing, application, and investigation experiments--have been developed and implemented in our calculus-based introductory courses. Students in small groups are engaged in designing and conducting their own experiments to observe some physical phenomena, test a physics principle, build a real-life device, solve a complex problem, or to conduct an open-inquiry investigation. This work was supported in part by NSF and in collaboration with the Physics and Astronomy Education Research Group at Rutgers University. In this talk, examples of the design tasks will be shown and assessment results of students' achievements will be reported.",Xueli Zou,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6319,"California State University, Chico",,2015
6293,Symposium Talk,Using a possibilities framework to understand student deductive reasoning attempts,"Students in physics courses often struggle to use or even follow formal reasoning when solving problems or analyzing physical situations. Instead, they tend to rely on ""intuition"" or temporarily salient thoughts that may be irrelevant to the situation at hand. Understanding what makes those ideas salient and why students make decisions based on them is necessary for improving communication with our students and helping them develop intuition based on proper reasoning. We approach this problem by assuming that students are authentically trying to reason, but they make subtle, nearly unconscious errors. Psychology research in deductive reasoning informs us that novice reasoners err by failing to consider all possibilities afforded by a given situation, either by failing to ""see"" them or by prematurely striking them down. We discuss how such errors may arise in physical situations and implications for instruction.",Jon Gaffney,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6293,Eastern Kentucky University,,2015
6302,Symposium Talk,Using physics to highlight the underlying structure of Riemann sums in learning definite integrals,"Several studies have shown that students are most successful solving definite integral application problems when they are able to see the definite integral as the sum of infinitely small products, or in other words when they understand the underlying structure of Riemann sums. This research involves classroom teaching experiments and clinical interviews with first-semester calculus students where initial instruction on definite integrals is centered on physics applications that highlight the underlying structure of Riemann sums. For example, when students approximate the force of water exerted on a dam, they attend to the underlying structure of force as the product of pressure and area. This research aims to identify strengths and weaknesses of the students as they develop an initial understanding of definite integrals, and how they use this understanding to build more formal ideas, such as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the relationship to area under a curve.",Vicki L.

6298,Symposium Talk,"What integration cues, and what cues integration in intermediate electromagnetism","The use of sophisticated math in physical models and problem solving has been identified as a major challenge for students in their intermediate and upper-division courses. Integration is a math tool widely used across physics contexts. It is perhaps the foremost mathematical technique in intermediate level electromagnetism courses. We present semi-quantitative research into students' difficulties with integration in such an electromagnetism course with cohorts of about 50 students. We have investigated what students' views on integration are, before they enter the electromagnetism course, and interpret the results in terms of their concept images of integration. We have found that students primarily see integration as a process of evaluation, and that the majority of students have no conceptual aspect in their concept image of integration. We confirm and quantify earlier results that recognizing dependency on a variable is a strong cue that prompts students to integrate. In addition, various technical difficulties with integration prevent almost all students from getting a completely correct answer to a typical electromagnetism problem involving integration.",Leanne Doughty,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=6298,Michigan State University,"Eilish McLoughlin, Dublin City University

6300,Symposium Talk,What the integral does: Physics students' efforts at making sense of integration,"Students use of a variety of resources to make sense of integration, and interpreting the definite integral as a sum of infinitesimal products (rooted in the concept of a Riemann sum) is particularly useful in many physical contexts.  This study of beginning and upper-level undergraduate physics students examines some obstacles students encounter when trying to make sense of integration, as well as some discomforts and skepticism some students maintain even after constructing useful conceptions of the integral.  In particular, many students attempt to explain what integration does by trying to interpret the algebraic manipulations and computations involved in finding antiderivatives.  This tendency, perhaps arising from their past experience of making sense of algebraic expressions and equations, suggests a reluctance to use their understanding of ""what a Riemann sum does"" to interpret ""what an integral does.""",Joseph F.
