799,Contributed Poster,A Design and Evaluation Study for Teaching Science Safely in South Dakota,"The National Science Teachers Association guidelines for preparing science teachers emphasize competent science safety knowledge. Best Practice dictates increasing the amount of student-centered hands-on science instruction which also increases the possibility of accident, especially in the classrooms of uninformed or untrained teachers. Phase I of this study sampled the science practice and classroom safety knowledge of a cross-section of K-12 science teachers in South Dakota to ascertain if teachers are aware of and trained in safe science practice. Are the teachers who have been trained in science safety practicing those procedures when they teach science? This study's data show that this may not be the case. Subsequent to this study, an analysis of the results from the safety survey will inform the design of a safety training certificate program for pre- and in-service teachers in South Dakota with the intent that teachers, once informed will practice science more safely.",Cathy Mariotti Ezrailson,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=799,University of South Dakota,"Rachel Kludt - Undergraduate Researcher (Rachel.Kludt@usd.edu)

813,Contributed Poster,A Study of Peer Instruction Methods with High School Physics Students,"This paper reports on the results of an experiment to test the use of a Peer Instruction (PI) in a high school environment. The study reports findings based on a population of 213 high school students attending algebra-based physics courses, both Honors and A level, taught by 5 different instructors. The results show a correlation between use of Peer Instruction and improved student conceptual understanding, as demonstrated by gains on a pre/post assessment instrument (FCI). However, there also appears to be a number of other factors that strongly influence the resulting gains. In addition to instructor differences, the data seem to indicate that students who are more physics-inclined and can answer questions correctly prior to instruction and prior to any Peer Instruction discussion subsequently achieve higher gains as measured by the FCI. While this is to be expected, the use of normalized gains is intended to mitigate this result, but it appears to be prevalent nonetheless. This raises questions as to what degree the FCI gains can be attributed to the use of Peer Instruction, to teacher differences, to student ability level or to simply increased familiarity with the question types presented on the FCI.",Karen Cummings,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=813,Southern Connecticut State University,"Stephen G.

714,Contributed Poster,A Taxonomy of Introductory Physics Problems (TIPP),"The existing collection of physics problems (both traditional and research-based) is becoming larger and more diverse.  In order to be efficiently used in classroom settings a classification of these problems is needed.  In the past few years we created a categorization of physics problems that establishes a connection between the physics problems, the type of declarative and procedural knowledge they involve and the cognitive processes they develop in students. This taxonomy is intended to be a valuable instructional resource for physics instructors which will enable them to select the problems used in their curricular materials based on the specifics of their students populations and the learning objectives they want to achieve for their class. This taxonomy will also provide a framework for creating physics-related assessments with a cognitive component. We will report on the design and validity and reliability studies that have been carried out during the development of this classification tool.",Raluca E.

805,Contributed Poster,An Investigation of Student Ability to Connect Particulate and Macroscopic Representations of a Gas,"This interdisciplinary project assessed the extent to which students in general education courses across two departments understood the assumptions of small-particle models and the ways in which these models relate to measurable properties. Many general education courses are surveys of a wide body of material, but spend relatively little time on fundamental issues such as the particulate nature of matter. Students are increasingly exposed to small particle models through animations on websites and visualizations in science textbooks, however relatively little time is spent on the interpretation and use of these models. The implicit assumption is that students have little difficulty with an idea as basic as the particulate nature of matter and are able to use small-particle models to explain the behavior of the observable, macroscopic world. As part of this project, we embedded conceptually-oriented questions on written assessments in general education courses in physics and chemistry. Questions were drawn from the published literature in chemical and physics education and developed by the research team. The results of this project provide a baseline measurement of the extent to which a diverse population of students in introductory physical science courses was able to develop and use particulate models to reason about macroscopic observables.",Kereen Monteyne,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=805,California State University Fullerton,"Barbara L.

We report results of a study of conceptual understanding of vectors among college students in their first physics course in a large private university in Mexico. Students in this institution have conceptual difficulties similar to those of American students, such as identifying magnitude and direction of a vector and performing vector addition. Furthermore, Mexican students have difficulties with the multiplication of a vector by a scalar and more advanced addition/subtraction operations using that product operation even after instruction in which vectors were part of the course curriculum.

While the LAs have teaching duties very similar to graduate Teaching Assistants (TAs), first year LAs are also required to take an education course focused on teaching methods. The purpose of this course is to first help LAs improve their teaching in the university classrooms and to encourage some of the LAs to consider careers as K-12 science teachers.  Throughout the semester LAs are asked to reflect on their learning about teaching and on the applications of these concepts to their current teaching experience.

746,Contributed Poster,Assessing Knowledge in a Graduate Course on PER,"The University of Maine Master of Science in Teaching program includes a pair of graduate courses entitled Integrated Approaches in Physics Education.  The courses integrate understanding of different elements of physics education research (PER), including research into student learning, content knowledge (CK) from the perspective of how it is learned, and reform-based curricula together with published evidence of their effectiveness.  Course elements include equal parts studying physics through proven curricula and discussion of research results from PER literature.  As part of our course development, we are researching course participants understanding of content, pedagogy, and education research.  We are also exploring assessment methods to analyze graduate student pedagogical content knowledge (PCK).  Early findings indicate that the courses improve both CK and PCK.  However, the improvement in these two arenas seems to be dependent on the background physics content knowledge of the student.

747,Contributed Poster,Assessing the Concepts of Integration and Differentiation in Multivariable Calculus,"Previous work on student understanding of graphical interpretation of slope, derivative, and area under curves in various physics contexts has shown substantial difficulties, most notably in kinematics. Concurrently, several reports point toward students lack of algebraic acumen as a likely cause for their low achievement in a physics classroom. In order to see if some of the documented issues arise from being asked mathematical questions about single- and multivariable calculus concepts in a physics course, we administered a brief survey on these basic concepts to students near the end of multivariable calculus. Some of the questions are based on our earlier work in thermal physics that are essentially stripped of their physics content. Initial findings show that even after three semesters of university-level calculus, students struggle with basic concepts of integration and differentiation. Individual survey items and summative scores will be presented.

At the Ohio State University, we developed, validated and implemented a series of single-concept clicker sequences for the entire calculus-based introductory physics course. Uniquely, each clicker sequence targets the same fundamental concept but contains questions with diverse surface features. To assess the effect of clicker sequences on students conceptual understanding, we conducted a comparative study between two parallel classes (a clicker class and a non-clicker class) in the spring 2008 quarter. These two classes address the same topics on waves and optics and share identical materials, including labs, recitations, homework, quizzes and tests. Results for students increased conceptual learning gains in the clicker class as compared to the non-clicker class are promising.",Lin Ding,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=767,"Department of Physics, The Ohio State University","Albert Lee, Neville W.

806,Contributed Poster,College Students' Lunar Phases Concept Domain,"Previous research (Lindell, 2001) [NEED REFERENCE AT BOTTOM, OR REMOVE CITATION] showed that college students' lunar phases concept domain consisted of eight dimensions: Period of Moon's orbit, Period of Moon Phases, Direction of Moon's orbit around the Earth, Motion of the Moon in the sky, Phase and Sun-Earth-Moon relationship, Phases-Location in the Sky-Time of Observation relationship, Cause of Phases and Effect of Location on Earth on observed phase. Each dimension uncovered has a number of facets, each representing the scientific correct answer, as well as the different alternative models possible. In a follow-up study, interview data was collected from 25 pre-service elementary education majors. This additional study uncovered previously undiscovered difficulties students had with lunar phases. The discovery of these new difficulties resulted in the need to revise the original concept domain. The new revised concept domain will be presented.",Rebecca S.

To deepen our understanding of student learning in our course environment and of these assessment tools as measures of student learning, we identify systematic trends and differences in results from these two instruments. We investigate correlations of both pre- and post- conceptual scores with other measures including traditional exam scores and course grades, student background (earlier grades), gender, a pretest of scientific reasoning, and tests of attitudes and beliefs about science and learning science. Overall, for practical purposes, we find the BEMA and CSEM are roughly equivalently useful instruments for measuring student learning in our course.",Steven Pollock,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=711,CU Boulder,,2008
723,Contributed Poster,Coupling Conceptual and Quantitative Problems to Develop Student Expertise in Introductory Physics,"We discuss the effect of administering conceptual and quantitative isomorphic problem pairs (CQIPP) back to back vs. asking students to solve only one of the problems in the CQIPP in introductory physics courses. Students who answered both questions in an CQIPP often performed better on the conceptual questions than those who answered the corresponding conceptual questions only. Although students often took advantage of the quantitative counterpart to answer a conceptual question of an IPP correctly, when only given the conceptual question, students seldom tried to convert it into a quantitative question, solve it and then reason about the solution conceptually. Even in individual interviews when students who were only given conceptual questions had difficulty and the interviewer explicitly encouraged them to convert the conceptual question into the corresponding quantitative problem by choosing appropriate variables, a majority of students were reluctant and preferred to guess the answer to the conceptual question based upon their gut feeling.",Chandralekha Singh,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=723,University of Pittsburgh,,2008
793,Contributed Poster,Curricular Process and Communicative Conception in Physics Education,"This poster describes a curricular process and its comparison with the communicative conception of physics education.

The curricular process of physics is a sequence of variant forms of curriculum mutually interconnected by six transformations, starting with the non-curricular member of the sequence  the scientific system of physics: 

CT1 = scientific system to conceptual curriculum,
CT2 = conceptual curriculum to intended curriculum,
CT3 = intended curriculum to project curriculum,
CT4 = project curriculum to operational curriculum,
CT5 = operational curriculum to implemented curriculum,
CT6 = implemented curriculum to attained curriculum.

The subject of physics education in the communicative conception is the educational communication of physics, which is defined as a continuous process of transfer of the scientific physical knowledge and methods into the minds of learners.

727,Contributed Poster,Developing a Framework for Analyzing Student Summaries of Textbooks,"As part of an ongoing study to develop methods to do quantitative assessment of student writing and therefore measure the effectiveness of writing to learn, a framework was developed to analyze student textbook summary writing in physics.  The framework was based on Waywood, which defines three cognitive levels seen in mathematics journaling: recounting (telling what happened), summarizing (putting it into your own words), and dialoging (sense-making).  This framework was refined, expanded, and tested in the context of analyzing student textbook summary writing in introductory physics.  The students participating in this study were enrolled in the 2007 spring semester of the Foundation Physics Course at the University of Cape Town, a component of the special access program which contains mostly second language English speakers.

766,Contributed Poster,Disentangling the Force Concept Inventory Using Latent Class Analysis,"This study probes the states of knowledge concerning three physics concepts, Newtons Third Law, Newtons Second Law, and the Motion/Force Relationship, as measured by several groups (factors) of FCI items. These knowledge states are not postulated, but rather extracted FCI pre/post instruction records from three universities. For each factor, via patterns of response, students were statistically grouped into latent classes, subsequently seen to correspond to (groups of) specific student misconceptions. Using Latent Transition Analysis we estimated the (transition) probabilities of students moving, pre/post, between such classes. Transitions in these factors seem uni-directional, towards classes corresponding to fewer misconceptions, indicating gains in understanding at all three universities. However, students in some latent classes are unlikely to learn, and students starting in the bottom classes appear to have virtually no chance of transitioning to the top. These results/methods can aid physics educators by providing detailed assessment of instructional effectiveness.",Ivan Ivanov,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=766,Vanier College,"Helena Dedic, Vanier College and CSLP Concordia University

About 500 students each semester, from different engineering majors, take electricity and magnetism, divided into sections of 30-40 students so there are several different instructors, both full-time and part-time. We report on the analysis of the CSEM data using concentration analysis for the purpose of evaluation of instruction. The results showed that students learning is dependent on instructor and on CSEM concept area. Students have large learning gains in some concept areas but small learning gains in others. Deeper analysis of a concept area showed that some instructors may tend to strengthen some misconceptions that students have.

744,Contributed Poster,Examining the Effectiveness of Clickers on Student Learning by Tracking Student Responses,"Clickers have been used for a number of years to help create active learning environments in the lecture classroom [1,2].  Researchers have shown that clickers stimulate student-student and student-lecturer interaction.  In addition, students value the use of clickers and feel that these devices contribute to their understanding [3].  Unfortunately, there are few research studies focusing on how knowledge is enhanced through their use.
To contribute to this body of research, we compared student responses on exam questions to similar or identical clicker questions presented during lecture.    Analysis of the responses to clicker and exam questions show how individual student knowledge evolves during instruction.  Although there is evidence of improvement during lecture, our results indicate that many students struggled when the questions were posed on exams.  In this poster, we present the findings from this study and discuss how open-ended questions and interviews allow us to better understand how clickers are affecting our instructional environment.

758,Contributed Poster,"How Abstract is Abstract? Signs, Salience, and Meaning in Physics","External representations, including pictures, graphs, text, gestures, and utterances, are key components of all curricular materials in physics. Such representations play a key role in cognitive function, particularly insofar as individuals interpret the meanings of and apply meanings to these representations. We have proposed a model of how individuals can make meaning of and with external representations through layered analogies and applied this model to learning abstract ideas in physics, i.e. EM waves. [1] [2] We extend this model in two ways. (1) We distinguish individuals interpretations of representations, which can be highly variable and fleeting, from the physics communities agreed upon interpretations, which are more stable and coherent.

779,Contributed Poster,How Differentials are Taught in Mathematics and Used in Physics,"Differentials are widely used in mathematics and applied in physics and engineering courses. However, there is little understanding of the concept of differentials among undergraduate students. This paper is part of an ongoing project to understand how differentials are taught in mathematics classrooms and used in physics undergraduate courses taken by a diverse group of engineering majors. To that end, we analyzed the mathematics instruction based on what is taught; specifically, we looked at the most commonly used calculus textbooks for a first-year calculus course. It is our claim that the way differentials are introduced in mathematics textbooks does not support undergraduate student understanding of the use of differentials in physics and engineering.",Angeles Dominguez,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=779,"Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Monterrey","Ricardo Pulido,

Framing, a theoretical framework developed  in sociology and linguistics, provides an analytical toolbox for examining the expectations that guide the actions and attention of individuals while teaching. We use framing to develop fine-grained analyses of two episodes of TAs teaching tutorials.

719,Contributed Poster,Identification of Specific Cognitive Processes Used for In-Depth Problem Solving,"The education and cognitive science literature contains a wide range of ideas about problem solving in math and science and the teaching of scientific problem solving.  Neuroscience studies provide a rich source of information about how the brain works at the cellular level and the location of brain activity while using specific processes. We use the results of research in these fields to frame the 44 specific component processes that were identified while interviewing a wide range of people solving a wide range of in-depth problems during the development of the CAPS (Colorado Assessment of Problem Solving).  Understanding the component processes used in problem solving provides insight for improved teaching.  We will present ways that solvers can compensate for certain weaknesses, show stoppers (processes that are required to solve a problem) and provide a sampling of cognitive processes that are needed in the real world but are not taught in the classroom.

724,Contributed Poster,Identifying Differences in Diagnostic Skills between Physics Students: Developing a Rubric,"Expert problem solvers are characterized by continuous evaluation of their progress towards a solution. One characteristic of expertise is self-diagnosis directed towards elaboration of the solvers conceptual understanding, knowledge organization or strategic approach. Self-diagnosis tasks aim at fostering diagnostic behavior by explicitly requiring students to present diagnosis as part of the activity of reviewing their problem solutions. We have been investigating how introductory physics students perform in such tasks.  
Developing a robust rubric is essential for objective evaluation of students' self-diagnosis skills. We discuss the development of a grading rubric that takes into account introductory physics students' content knowledge as well as analysis, planning and presentation skills. Using this rubric, we have found the inter-rater reliability to be better than 80%. The rubric can easily be adapted to other problems.

762,Contributed Poster,Identifying Student Difficulty in Problem Solving Process via the Framework of the House Model(HM),"Recently, many students have been losing their interest in physics. One of the essential reasons why students look away from physics is the fact that they face difficulty in solving physics problems. Since mechanics is a fundamental subject in physics, many researchers have studied how students learn mechanics and solve problems related to mechanics. However, there is little research on the students' specific difficulties in the process of problem solving. This study investigated students specific difficulties (with degrees of difficulties) and the core sources of these difficulties. Twenty-five university students who majored in physics education participated in this study. We have developed a framework, the House Model, for helping and analyzing students' problem solving. We found that students felt greater difficulty in planning and executing steps than in visualizing, knowing and finding steps. As the problems grew in difficulty, this pattern became more distinct. We will also describe the sources of the students difficulties and discuss the educational implications of these results.",Taejin Byun,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=762,Seoul National University,"Yongwook Cheong, Sangwoo Ha and Gyoungho Lee, Seoul National University",2008
787,Contributed Poster,Identifying and Addressing Partial Differentiation Difficulties in Calculus and Thermodynamics,"We have reported previously that upper-level thermodynamics students demonstrate an inability to correctly equate the mixed second-order partial derivatives of the state function of volume (nonzero quantities in general), arguing instead that these derivatives must identically equal zero.[1]  Here we document the presence of this difficulty among students enrolled in a multivariable calculus course.  Data were gathered via diagnostic questions structurally identical to those administered in the thermodynamics course, yet devoid of physical context.  We additionally present a guided-inquiry tutorial sequence that was specifically developed to address this and related student difficulties with partial derivatives encountered in our research.  The sequence uses a graphical interpretation of partial derivatives in the context of an ideal gas P-V-T surface to bridge the abstract mathematical concepts with concrete physical properties.  Preliminary results indicate that the sequence effectively addresses the above difficulty, and also positively impacts student performance on related topics.

781,Contributed Poster,Implementing Tutorials in Introductory Physics in an International Context: The Effect of Language,"Tutorials in Introductory Physics from the University of Washington have become widely recognized as one of the more successful educational strategies for teaching physics. They were originally developed in English and have been translated to different languages. Instructors in non-English speaking countries wanting to implement Tutorials therefore have a choice between using the materials in the original English versions, and consequently teaching in a language other than the native language of most of their students, or using translations into the local language.  We present two experiences: a large private university in Mexico and a small public university in Germany, both of which use the Tutorials as the main strategy for physics courses. Through analysis of empirical data on student performance, we have been investigating to what extent the effectiveness of such materials is affected by their translation when the instruction is in the local language or by the non-native language capabilities of the participating students when the instruction is in English.",Genaro Zavala,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=781,"Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Monterrey","Christian H.

722,Contributed Poster,Institutionalizing Change: Case Studies & Institutional Analysis of Pedagogical Reform in Intro Phys,"We examine how the University of Colorado has created a sustained use of a research-based curriculum in two courses simultaneously, despite the significant increases in cost and time commitment. The adoption of the research-based University of Washington Tutorials in Introductory Physics [1] curriculum required significant pedagogical shifts in the role of students, faculty and their interactions. We describe both successful and unsuccessful hand-offs of the curriculum to professors from traditional physics research disciplines.[2] Through faculty interviews, we capture a shift in how professors talk about this curriculum, as well as their views about teaching and learning physics before and after they implement the tutorial curriculum. We find that teaching with the Tutorial curriculum can result in shifts in professors' views about teaching and learning physics, although this does not always happen. We describe characteristics of the professor's participation in implementing this curriculum and in the professor's background in order to make sense of when we do and do not see shifts.

This programming environment is able to offer a web-accessible problem solving experience that enables students to work at their own pace and receive feedback. Intuitive graphical symbols, modular structures and the ability to create templates are just a few of the advantages this software has to offer. The architecture of an application can be designed in a way that allows instructors with little knowledge of LabVIEW to easily personalize it. Both the physics solution and the interactive pedagogy can be visually programmed in LabVIEW. Our physics pedagogy approach is that of cognitive apprenticeship, in that the tutorial guides students to develop conceptual understanding and physical insight into phenomena, rather than purely formula-based solutions.  We demonstrate how this model is reflected in the design and programming of the interactive tutorials.",Lucian Undreiu,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=770,UVA Wise,"David Schuster, Western Michigan University

Underlying these revisions is a strong research component that seeks to assess the effectiveness of these instructional innovations. 
This project has involved over half the faculty in the Physics Program and over ten student researchers who received degrees or are currently pursuing degrees in science. These students have been involved in curriculum development, research on student learning, and work as laboratory and classroom facilitators. Because of the large scope of departmental involvement the project has evolved into a community endeavor in which both faculty and students play an active role in program innovations.

821,Contributed Poster,Learning Problem-Solving Using Formative Assessment Rubrics,"In our introductory calculus based physics class, students learn to solve and assess problems using rubrics. The problems are complex, involving multiple concepts and stages (for example, using conservation of momentum and conservation of energy, in different stages). The rubrics have detailed but generic descriptors for different categories: physics concepts, representations, modeling the situation, problem-solving machinery, and reasonableness of answer. At previous meetings, we have shown that students improve upon evaluation abilities and learn to successfully use the rubrics for peer- and self-assessment, if they are also provided with taxonomies that connect the rubric items with a specific problem. In this poster, we first explore the effects of making the assessment more formative: how do students perform if they have to solve a problem, write a taxonomy, self-assess their work, and then revise their solution based on their taxonomy and self-assessment?

768,Contributed Poster,Ontologies of Physics Concepts: A Toy Model,"A prominent approach towards understanding the source of naive misconceptions in science argues that misconceptions arise due to novices' commitment to categorizing physics processes (such as heat, current) as substances and that there is a significant cognitive barrier to re-categorizing these concepts correctly [1]. Methodologically, this approach assumes a one-to-one correspondence between verbal expression and ontology in the mind. Previously, we have used this methodology to show that expert as well as novice reasoning of a concept is not constrained within a single ontological category [2]. Here we present an alternative way to model students' ontologies, without the assumption binding verbal expression directly to ontologies. We model a graduate student's reasoning about heat in terms of the conceptual resources [3] that she uses. We claim that clusters of closely-associated resources activated in the moment reflect her ontology of heat and explore how her epistemological stance influences her ontology of heat over the course of her explanation*.

We find that students use various reasoning modes and knowledge elements in conjunction. Their thinking may usefully be described as an interplay of principle-based and case-based reasoning, drawing on a knowledge mixture of basic principles, procedures, specific cases and recalled result features. Even though we usually present solutions and teach problem-solving as a systematic application of principles, real cognition is more complex. Associative thinking in terms of prior cases seems to be a strong natural tendency of both novices and experts. However novices are not easily able to discriminate the specific from the general, and tend to lack epistemic awareness and metacognitive skills.

I present preliminary data from student interviews and paper and pencil worksheets that suggest some difficulties with interpretation are related to ambiguities in notation that are context dependent.,Brant Hinrichs,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=743,"Drury University, Physics Department",,2008
764,Contributed Poster,Student Response to Instruction: When and How Much?,"In the physics education research community, a common format for evaluation is pre- and post-tests. At The Ohio State University, we take advantage of our large class sizes by collecting more frequent data points. The data cover the first two quarters (mechanics, E&M) of a calculus-based introductory sequence populated primarily by first- and second-year engineering majors. Different subpopulations of students are evaluated every week of the quarter using a variety of conceptual and procedural tasks related to different topics in the curriculum. Unsurprisingly for a traditional introductory course, there is little change on many conceptual questions. However, some student ideas peak and decay during a quarter, a pattern expected from memory research yet unpredicted by pre-/post-testing.  In addition, some correct ideas decrease dramatically when newer topics interfere with prior knowledge.   This research is partially supported by a grant from the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education (#R305H050125).",Eleanor C Sayre,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=764,Ohio State University,"Andrew F Heckler, Ohio State University, heckler.6@osu.edu",2008
763,Contributed Poster,Student Understanding of P-V Diagrams and Conceptions about Integration,"As part of ongoing research into upper-level undergraduate student understanding of thermodynamics at the University of Maine, we report on students' understanding of thermodynamic work, internal energy and the associated mathematics.
 New interview data of physics majors, as well as written data obtained in a calculus III class, support our previous findings and provide for a more in-depth look into factors impacting student difficulties with thermodynamic quantities.
Analysis of written and interview data has revealed student conceptions about integration that might otherwise be interpreted as conceptual difficulties with the physics.  The data suggest that students' application of the state function concept to thermodynamic work may be due in part to incorrect conceptions regarding integration.  The data also suggest that students lack the correct mathematical foundation of the state function concept, which may be a factor in its indiscriminate application.",Evan B.

720,Contributed Poster,Student Understanding of Quantum Measurement and Uncertainty,"Introductory courses in classical physics appear to be promoting in students a perspective we are calling local realism, where, for example, it is assumed that a particles position and momentum have simultaneous reality  both physical quantities can be described with well-defined values at all times.  Such a perspective can be problematic for introductory quantum physics students, who must develop new epistemic and ontological resources in order to properly interpret what it means to have knowledge of quantum observables.  We document this evolution in student thinking in part through pre/post-instruction evaluations using the CLASS survey.[1]  We further characterize variations in student epistemic and ontological commitments by examining responses to coupled essay questions and quantum attitudes statements.  We find that, despite performance level in the course, many students are still exhibiting a realist perspective in some quantum contexts. We also find that this effect can be significantly influenced by instruction, where we observe variations for courses with differing learning goals.

We have found that students typically predict the correct type of board (long and smooth) to complete the challenge, but their responses include evidence of both physics and everyday reasoning.  After working through the materials, the majority of students understand the relationship between distance and force in the inclined plane as well as why the inclined plane is useful to lift heavy objects.

However, since PER data is based on student responses, there are often several difficulties that arise in taking those responses and turning them into quantitative measures.  Using methods and tools from the field of classification (data mining), we look at how the type of question being asked (e.g., multiple choice, free response, ranking task) determines what kind of measurement can appropriately be made and how that in turn effects the mathematics of comparison.  We also examine the extent to which, when using a hierarchical clustering method, the resolution of quantitative ties  responses that are determined to be equidistant to more than one classification category  leads to changes in the final classification.",R.

715,Contributed Poster,The Persistence of the Gender Gap in Introductory Physics,"Our previous research[1] showed that despite the use of interactive engagement techniques, the gap in performance between males and females on a conceptual learning survey persisted from pre- to posttest, at our institution.  Such findings were counter to previously published work[2].  A follow-up study[3] suggested the gender gap may be more a result of differences in previous physics knowledge than gender.  Current research continues to analyze factors that may influence the observed gender gap in our courses.  We find that there are significant differences (p<0.05) between males and females on several measures of background understanding of math and physics, as well as attitudes about physics.  The posttest data from conceptual assessments are modeled using two regression models (multiple regression and logistic regression) to estimate the gender gap in posttest scores after controlling for these prior factors.  The results indicate that the gender gap exists in interactive physics classes at our institution, but is due in large part to differences in previous physics and math knowledge, and attitudes and beliefs.

777,Contributed Poster,The Roles of Evidence in Scientific Argument,"The view of science in the education community is shifting from a rhetoric of conclusions to a social process of knowledge construction, and engagement in scientific argumentation is a hallmark of such knowledge construction.  This emphasis on argument recasts the role of evidence and data in scientific classrooms: rather than being used to demonstrate scientific principles, it is the grounds on which claims are warranted. In this poster, I explore a transcript of scientific discourse, exploring the rules by which participants in the discourse endorse or reject scientific claims.  I appeal for a more nuanced understanding of evidence as one of many criteria by which scientific claims are evaluated, and that evidence, at times, is incommensurable with other (possibly more scientific) criteria for evaluating claims.  This view of argumentation, and the peculiar language games associated with argumentation, is particularly relevant for understanding difficulties that diverse student populations may face.",Leslie Atkins,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=777,California State University - Chico,,2008

We hope that students will use the examples to refine their understanding of the principle and be able to transfer the principle to new situations. However, research in cognitive science has shown that students understanding of a new principle may become bound up with the example(s) used to illustrate it. We report on a study with physics students to see if this specificity effect was present in their reasoning.  The data show that even students who understand and can implement a particular physics principle have a strong tendency to discard that principle when the transfer task appears superficially similar to their training example.

752,Contributed Poster,Understanding and Encouraging Effective Collaboration in Introductory Physics Courses [1],"Anecdotal evidence from the introductory physics classrooms at Chicago State University suggests that our students view collaboration as an important tool in their learning.  Despite this, students often need additional instruction and support for effective collaboration in order to make discussions productive.  In order to aid students in establishing effective collaborations we want to capitalize on the fact that students at CSU readily accept the inquiry approach to instruction.            
In this poster, we present the initial stage of this work.  Specifically, we have begun to video-tape student interactions in the classroom and interview students about the nature of learning.  In addition, we have developed and administered an instrument that gauges the value students place on the use of guided inquiry.   By utilizing a specific criteria and analyzing the occurrence of specific behaviors in the classroom we can determine the effectiveness of collaboration during group work.[2] Responses regarding how students value the use of questions in instruction suggest how peer questioning can be used to promote effective collaboration.

It can provide a computational system, reflect a physical idea, conveniently encode a rule, and so forth.  A physics student thus has many different options for using mathematics in his physics problem solving.  We present a short example from the problem solving work of upper level physics students and use it to illustrate the epistemic framing process:  framing because these students are focusing on a subset of their total math knowledge, epistemic because their choice of subset relates to what they see (at that particular time) as the nature of the math knowledge in play.  We illustrate how looking for students warrants, the often unspoken reasons they think their evidence supports their mathematical claims, can serve as a window to their epistemic framing.

Our instincts and years of training lead us to tell students about science and math as we understand it. Unfortunately research has shown that telling is not always the most effective way to share our understanding.  Approximately 250 interviews have been conducted with simulations developed by the Physics Education Technology (PhET) Project [1]. These interviews have provided a wealth of data about student engagement and learning. Weve conducted interviews using several different levels of guidance and found that the level of guidance influences the amount of student engagement. Minimal but nonzero guidance with many of these simulations creates the optimum engaged exploration and impressive amounts of learning.[2]

This program spans twenty years and has focused on mathematics learning and participation among African American adults and adolescents in school and non-school contexts. While mainstream mathematics education research has conceptualized learning and participation as cognitive and cultural activities, my work pushes these perspectives to consider mathematics learning and participation as racialized forms of experience; that is, as activities structured by the larger relations and discourses of race that exist in the broader society. For many African American learners, African American identity has served as a marker for degradation in mainstream research and policy contexts. Meanwhile, the concept of race has remained undertheorized. One consequence is a widely accepted, yet uncontested, racial hierarchy of mathematical ability that constructs African American learners as mathematically illiterate relative to other learners.

818,Invited Talk,A Variety of Diversity: Facing Higher Education's Educational Challenges,"First among the many important challenges facing American higher education is the need to improve the effectiveness of our educational programs. Public concern has heightened the sense of urgency for colleges and universities to make progress on improving and measuring educational outcomes, which is made more challenging by the varieties of diversity facing us. Students are more diverse than ever, both in terms of their personal characteristics but also in terms of their abilities, preparation, and expectations.

In order to make sense of the increasing varieties of diversity affecting our postsecondary educational efforts this session will draw upon research from a range of local and national efforts in these areas. One example is ongoing research at the University of Michigan that explores the educational implications of implementing a web-based lecture capture system in large lecture courses. Student use of and reactions to such systems is important, as is the potential to influence course performance for students in general, but also for underrepresented and at-risk student subpopulations. In addition to helping bring our current landscape into focus, the session will identify effective practices as well as continuing challenges to improving educational practice for undergraduate students.",Eric Dey,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=818,University of Michigan,,2008

Baseline results for the students showed that there were no gender differences on the achievement test but that white students scored significantly higher than non-white students. However, parent/adult involvement with chemistry homework and projects was a significant negative predictor of 11th grade students' chemistry achievement test score.

This is particularly true in urban districts, where this study examined access to and availability of high school physics. New York City's secondary schools were surveyed to determine where physics was offered and how many students were enrolled. Statistics were performed to compare differences between physics and non-physics schools. Additionally, organizational factors were examined that relate to physics availability, such as the magnet school configuration, the AP Physics and conceptual physics options, and science curricular sequence. Overall, it was determined that physics availability is limited in NYC schools, a serious inequity that disproportionately affects students of color and poor children.

Specifically, I use Gloria Anzald�a's notion of Nepantla--a liminal space that facilitates transformation. In this presentation, I will describe aspects of a model of teacher education I have developed and offer examples of how teacher candidates move through states of what Anzald�a would call ignorance/distancing versus knowledge/connection with others. Finally, I suggest that our work of preparing teachers must help them not only recognize a state of Nepantla (to see and participate in multiple realities) but also come to expect the uneasiness with being in that space, while celebrating its potential to birth new identities and create new (forbidden) knowledges.",Rochelle Guti�rrez,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=819,"University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign",,2008

801,PER Dating Service,Evaluating Safe Science Teaching Practice in the U.S.,"Science safety in is a vital issue in 2008 because: 1) it is tested on many state science content tests, 2) pre-service teachers take the Praxis test which also requires knowledge of safe science practice, 3) teachers are being trained in alternative ways that may omit safe science methods, 4) science content standards in many states emphasize doing science without specific safety guidelines, especially for middle and elementary classrooms and 5) science methods curricula have not always included planning for and conducting experiments safely. National Science Education Standards (NSES) encourage active science learning with best practices promoting inquiry-based and hands-on instruction at all instructional levels. Teachers who teach science are using equipment that may or may not be developmentally appropriate for their students (using open flames in K-2nd grade, for example). Accidents occur and go unreported.

833,Targeted Poster,Acting in Our Own Self-Interest: Blending University and Community,"Research in physics education has demonstrated new tools and models for improving the understanding and engagement of traditional college students. [1]  The research community has bridged the gap to pre-college education, even elementary school. [2]  However little work has been done to engage students in out-of-school settings, particularly for those students from populations under-represented in the sciences.  We present a theoretically-grounded model of university-community partnership [3] that engages students and children in a collective enterprise that has the potential to improve the participation and education of all.  We document the impact of these programs on: university participants (undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs in physics) who learn about education, the community and even some science; children in the community who learn about science, the nature of science and develop the identities and attitudes towards science; and, shifts in institutional practice which may allow these programs to be sustained. We conclude by identifying some of the structural barriers to implementing and sustaining these programs.

This poster is a companion to the one by Hsu.  In this presentation, we report on a collaborative investigation into ways in which the Physics by Inquiry (PbI) curriculum (by McDermott and the PEG at the University of Washington) can be implemented by utilizing undergraduate peer instructors in large enrollment courses serving student populations other than the one in which it was originally intended. Typically, PbI is implemented in small classes of pre-service teachers with multiple instructors. However, many institutions, including community colleges and primarily undergraduate institutions, have various implementation constraints. We present three models for implementation of the PbI curriculum as responses to our local constraints at the University of Minnesota, Southern Connecticut State University and Baltimore City Community College.  We will also report on conceptual learning outcomes in these courses.

It focuses on an assessment of student attitudes toward physics and the learning of physics using the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS). In virtually all standard introductory physics courses, students' responses to CLASS questions regress toward less expert-like attitudes or at best, remain largely stable over the time frame of the course. However, in our adapted PbI courses, we observe large, significant shifts toward more expert-like attitudes based on students' responses.

The Society of Physics Students has begun an experiment using a jeopardy-like game at physics meetings in an attempt to generate conversations about diversity. The physics jeopardy game is part of a ""Future Faces of Physics"" kit that includes a variety of materials that are of interest to those wanting to address under-represented audiences in physics, such as video clips exhibiting common physics words in sign language, tactile representations of the lunar surface for blind students, guidelines regarding lab procedures for the wheel-chair bound, and the book, ""Einstein on Race and Racism"" with a challenge letter directed at SPS chapters from the authors. While attempts to assess the impact of the game are modest, we will report anecdotally some of the qualitative features seen in the discussions when the game is played.

I went with enthusiasm and optimism, confident that my knowledge of student learning of science and my personality would translate to great student achievement. While I feel that I met with some success, in this poster I instead focus on the overwhelming challenges of succeeding in this environment.

This poster is concerned with the design and study of Collaborative Diagnosis of Conceptions (CDC), an instructional strategy aimed at developing pre-service teachers' deep understanding of content and at the same time develop their pedagogic content knowledge about ways to interact in the future with their students' conceptual understanding using a similar instructional strategy. The CDC strategy was tried out and studied in a geometrical optics course with a total of 123 pre-service elementary science teachers from multicultural backgrounds (rural Bedouin communities and multicultural urban communities).

The results of the study show that the pre-service teachers, in particularly the low achieving students, advanced significantly in their understanding of the optical concepts. However, only after we added a meta-cognitive component requiring the pre-service teachers to discuss and explicate, continuously, the pedagogical characteristics of the strategy, they also advanced significantly in their understanding of the pedagogical merit of this strategy.",Osnat Eldar,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=849,"Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel","Bat-Sheva Eylon, Miky Ronen

845,Targeted Poster,From Diagnostic Skills to Success in the Physics Classroom,"""Self-diagnosis tasks"" aim at fostering diagnostic behavior by explicitly requiring students to present diagnosis as part of the activity of reviewing their problem solutions. The recitation classes in an introductory physics class (~200 students) were split into three experimental groups in which different levels of guidance was provided for performing the self-diagnosis activities and a control group. We have been investigating how a) students in each group performed on subsequent near and far transfer questions given as part of the exams; and b) comparing the relation between student's initial scores on their quizzes vs. their performance on the exams, and the relation between student's self-diagnosis scores and their performance on the exams.
We conclude with some hypotheses about the students' ability to self-diagnose that emphasizes the importance of teaching students how to diagnosis their own mistakes.

Female students made up approximately 20% of these classes. We present relationships between pre and post FCI scores, course grades, and student background factors for females and males.  Examples of background factors include major, high school physics, and math preparation. We will compare our results with previous studies from Harvard [1] and the University of Colorado [2].

On average, female students have lower Force Concept Inventory (FCI) pretest scores than males. Teaching with Peer Instruction not only yields significantly greater FCI posttest scores for both males and females but also reduces the FCI posttest gender gap. Teaching with several interactive components (Peer Instruction, Tutorials in Introductory Physics, and Just-in-Time Teaching) eliminates the FCI posttest gender gap, and no gender disparity exists in grades, in spite of females' lower FCI pretest scores.

In an interview study with six university physics faculty, we have identified an important conflict in the way that they view problem solving in the context of an introductory course.  Three important findings will be described in this poster: 1) physics instructors believe that student learning in a physics course primarily occurs when students generalize and refine their physics knowledge by reflectively solving physics problems; 2) physics instructors realize that most students do not possess the skills necessary to engage in reflective problem solving when they enter an introductory physics course; and 3) physics instructors do not expect and do not intervene to make students improve their reflective problem solving skills during the introductory physics course.  Suggestions will be made for how to help instructors resolve the conflict represented on one hand by their (correct) assessment that students do not have the skills necessary to engage in the primary learning activity of the course and on the other hand by their pessimistic estimation of students' ability to improve in these very skills.",Charles Henderson,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=848,Western Michigan University,"Edit Yerushalmi and Elisheva Cohen, Weizmann Institute,

However, the degree of similarity of monks' ideas with those of US students varied with the topic.  For example, ideas that emerged in the topic of magnetism were often consistent with western ideas while ideas about color addition were sometimes strikingly different from ideas that American students use.

846,Targeted Poster,Strategy Writing and Conceptual Gains Among At-Risk Physics Students,"Many novice physics students studying mechanics, particularly those at risk for poor performance, do not attend to the physical principles behind the particular equations they use to solve problems.  This leads to the well-known novice behavior of preoccupation with the surface features of a problem rather than the cueing on deep conceptual structure exhibited by experts.  A small subset (N=50) of students pre-identified to be at risk for failing an introductory calculus-based physics class (N~1100) participated in a concurrent supplemental course designed to promote conceptual awareness and use in solving problems. The supplement requires students to explicitly identify the operative physical principle needed to solve the problem, provide a short justification explaining what features of the problem imply the principle is applicable, create a written procedure for solving the problem using said principle, and finally generate a fully worked solution with written explanations of each step.  We will discuss performance in: a) a problem categorization task involving sorting problems by operative physical principle and b) examinations in the introductory course.",Adam D.

839,Targeted Poster,The Persistence of the Gender Gap in Introductory Physics,"We previously showed [1] that despite teaching with interactive engagement techniques, the gap in performance between males and females on conceptual learning surveys persisted from pre- to posttest, at our institution.  Such findings were counter to previously published work [2].  Subsequent work [3] suggested the gender gap may be attributable to differences in physics background. Our current work analyzes factors that may influence the observed gender gap in our courses.  We find that there are significant differences (p<0.05) between males and females on several measures of math and physics preparation, as well as attitudes about physics. Posttest conceptual assessment data are modeled using both multiple regression and logistic regression to estimate the gender gap in posttest scores after controlling for these prior factors. We find that at our institution the gender gap persists in interactive physics classes, but is largely due to differences in physics and math preparation and attitudes.

Interactive Lecture Demonstrations (ILDs) using real-time data logging were emphasized since they would be teaching in a one-computer classroom. This poster describes the workshop experience.

832,Targeted Poster,Utilizing the Resources of Urban University Students to Develop Effective Instructional Environments,"Physics Education Researchers have provided instructors with (1) tools to assess student learning, (2) details on the state of student knowledge, and (3) instructional materials and learning environments that have proven to be effective in promoting understanding.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of this work has centered on students and instruction at the traditional research university. As instructors begin to implement innovative instructional materials, and as researchers begin to investigate student learning with diverse populations, complex differences emerge.  The use of traditional PER tools in non-traditional environments, such as the urban, comprehensive university, often leads to a very narrow picture of student development.  Often, this limited view highlights deficiencies in learning and fails to reveal the strengths and resources of this population.  In this poster we highlight some of the resources we have found with the population of students at urban institutions in Chicago.  In addition, we describe how these resources have guided the implementation of a specific type of instructional approach.",Mel S.

807,Targeted Poster Session,"Applications of PER in Diverse Settings: Perspectives on Audience, Method and Implementation","Physics education research has traditionally not addressed variation in student population. Are the tools, practices, and findings of PER relevant, applicable and valid across populations? This session includes four PER groups working with underrepresented student populations differing by audience, method and implementation. Brewe, Kramer and OBrien at Florida International University, a Hispanic-Serving Institution, use reform to develop community; Sabella, Coble and Bowen of Chicago State University, a Black-Serving Institution, apply PER methods to identify underrepresented university students' resources; Finkelstein and Mayhew of the University of Colorado investigate impacts and institutional implications of informal education programs; Steinberg of City College of New York implements PER-based approaches as a science teacher at a mixed public high school in Harlem. These researchers are united by the goal of identifying problems within the structures of physics/science education relevant to encouraging student successes. These posters identify a diversity of approaches to improving educational opportunities for underrepresented student groups and limitations, challenges and opportunities for broadening inclusion.",Eric Brewe,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=807,Florida International University,"Laird Kramer, George OBrien

728,Targeted Poster Session,Developing Learning Skills in the Physics Classroom to Attend to Diverse Populations ,"Physics Instructors believe many students enter their classes lacking the learning skills required to perform well in the introductory physics course. Yet traditional university teaching typically does not attempt to develop students' learning skills required to benefit from the physics course. 
An essential skill mentioned frequently is reflection in problem solving while carrying out a paper pencil task or while performing an experiment.  Reflection upon the problem solving process in both types of tasks could include  evaluating one's own solution, self-diagnosing former steps while elaborating the understanding of the physics involved in the problem, as well as the perception that such behavior is constructive.  How do students entering the introductory physics classroom differ in their reflection in problem solving? To what extent does this distribution of skill predict students' ability to learn the material taught in the course? Does this skill improve as the students progress through  traditional university courses which  typically do not attempt to develop students' learning skills? How can we modify instruction to help develop these learning skills in students who need it while also benefiting the students who already possess these learning skills? 

The posters in the session will shed light on diverse aspects of the subject as follows: (1) the connection between learning skills and the achievements of the students in class, (2)  instructors' approaches regarding the development of these skills, (3) students' epistemic stance regarding learning from problem solving both while performing paper pencil tasks and performing experiments, and (4) possible interventions aimed to help students reflect upon the problem solving process in different situations.",E.

797,Targeted Poster Session,"Does PER-Based Instruction Help Underrepresented Groups Succeed, and How Can It Do So Better?","An issue of widespread concern among physicists is the low representation of women and certain ethnic minorities in physics. As PER seeks to improve physics learning for all, we must ask whether PER-based instructional methods can also help ameliorate (or at least not aggravate) the underrepresentation of these groups. This poster session will facilitate a forward-looking discussion of how PER-based instruction can best foster the success of these groups by bringing together insights from work in three areas: (1) evaluating the success of underrepresented students with PER-based methods, (2) identifying barriers to these students' success in ordinary instructional environments, and (3) existing programs (not necessarily PER-based) aimed at improving the retention and learning of these underrepresented groups. After work in these three areas is presented and discussed, all attendees will participate in brainstorming future work that will identify strengths and weaknesses in the current PER-based methods, with the ultimate goal of developing improved instructional methods.",Catherine H.

810,Targeted Poster Session,Implementing PER in Other Cultures,"It is not obvious to what extent PER findings with English-speaking students apply to students from other cultures in other parts of the world and vice versa.  Some PER community members have experience that shed light on this issue, which includes anticipations concerning initial conceptions, typical student responses to PER-based instructional strategies, preparation and understanding of teachers, and lack of resources available to teachers to a degree not generally seen in the US.  Experiences, evidence, lessons learned and recommendations will be offered by the presenters in this targeted poster session.",Dewey Dykstra,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=810,Boise State University,"Andy Johnson, Black Hills State University; Ronald K.

809,Targeted Poster Session,Showing Ourselves Friendly: Addressing Race in Physics Culture,"It is said that if you want to be a friend, you must show yourself friendly.  This means that in order to forge a connection, we must deal with our own actions rather than the actions of those we want to befriend.  This years PERC has been organized around issues of diversity, and this targeted poster session focuses specifically on issues of race.  In order to show ourselves friendly in this context, we must examine our own behaviors and the effects they have on racial minorities.  Each poster in this session offers us an opportunity to examine our own contributions to the racial aspects of physics culture.  We hope that you will accept the invitation this opportunity extends, and share your ideas and experiences with us.",Melissa H.

731,Targeted Poster Session,Student Perspectives on Learning Physics and Their Learning of Force and Motion Concepts,"Considerable research and curriculum development has focused on students learning of force and motion concepts, yet research shows that many students fail to gain Newtonian-based understanding of force and motion concepts.  Researchers have demonstrated the connection between learning in physics and students personal epistemologies.  Yet this research has typically used time intensive qualitative methods or Likert scale surveys which can result in loss of meaning.  Thus this study used Q methodology, a sophisticated technique for determining the various perspectives on a topic by correlating people with similar views.  Four distinct perspectives about learning physics concepts in a first semester physics classroom were revealed with Q.  One of these four perspectives was positively correlated with the posttest scores on the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE) while the remaining perspectives were negatively correlated with the FMCE posttest scores.  Implications of these results will be presented.",Susan Ramlo,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2008/detail.cfm?ID=731,The University of Akron,,2008
