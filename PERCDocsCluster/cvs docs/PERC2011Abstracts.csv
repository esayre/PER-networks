Elaborating verbal explanation of the meaning behind math expression often does not seem to help. Therefore, we decided to focus on visual perception. Based on knowledge from grounded cognition research, perception should be more powerful in conveying meaning. We designed several animated multimedia solutions for some difficult problems according to principles derived from grounded cognition, and compared their ability to improve transfer with two very similar animated solutions that contain equivalent spatial information but lack critical perceptual elements. The perceptually rich (good looking) solutions turn out to significantly improve transfer of physics principles, especially when the target problem involves much abstract logical reasoning, and is very different from the example in terms of surface feature.",Zhongzhou Chen,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4167,University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign,"Gary Gladding

4075,Contributed Poster,"""Implicit Action"": Understanding Discourse Management in Modeling Instruction","We present Implicit Action, a discourse management tool, through a qualitative video analysis of a Florida International University Modeling Instruction Introductory Physics I class. Implicit Action in Modeling Instruction is where instructors deliberately create intellectual space in which students ideally see value and need for the construction of new classroom norms and tools that are productive in developing a learning community. This space is created by the implications expressed through the instructor's deliberate actions. Discourse Management is a technique to moderate student discussion in Modeling Instruction classes at the university level that was initially described by Desbien. Implicit Action is one of 9 Modeling Discourse Management tools that we have identified. By means of qualitative analysis we illustrate the effectiveness of Implicit Action in implementing Modeling Pedagogical Theory.",Jared Durden,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4075,FIU,"Eric Brewe/Co-author

4171,Contributed Poster,"A 12,000-student analysis of normalized gain and alternative metrics using the FCI","The normalized gain, g, is among the most widely- and easily-used metrics in physics education research, particularly as it is applied to the Force Concept Inventory (FCI).  However, its ease and ubiquity mask several pitfalls associated with the metric, particularly when it is used to directly compare a small number of courses.  Specifically, these pitfalls are: the ambiguities between class and student average gain, the tendency not to report error margins, the effect of losses in initially high-scoring populations, and the extent to which details about classes are washed out by reporting a single number.  Here, we extend the work of others by highlighting these pitfalls using data collected from over 12,000 students in several universities.  Ultimately, we propose an alternative metric that assesses the rate of Newtonian thinking in a class, which is more closely aligned with the description of the FCI suggested by the survey authors.",Jason Dowd,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4171,Harvard University,"Kelly Miller, Harvard University

Self-efficacy is both informed by past performance (of the individual and of those considered to be peers), and can impact current performance levels.  This may be especially important for female students in science, who tend to drop out of science classrooms with much better performance records than their male counterparts.  Ethnic minorities are also under-represented in STEM fields.  Self-efficacy beliefs for both female and minority students informs course-taking patterns and career choices.  Work has been underway to develop an instrument to examine self-efficacy beliefs of students on their problem solving abilities in physics, paralleling work in math self-efficacy literature.

We have used an instrument (CLASS) that measures how student epistemologies evolve over the course of their undergraduate degrees. Our previous work has sampled a cross-section of students across the Physics undergraduate programme at Edinburgh in a given academic year, and found that student attitudes and beliefs remain essentially static. Here, we present fully longitudinal data collected over the past three years, where we track the evolution of attitudes and beliefs of one group of students. We find broadly similar results: attitudes and beliefs remain surprisingly consistent over time. This suggests that a cross-sectional or pseudo-longitudinal study (collecting snapshot data in one year) is a valid methodology, rather than necessarily having to wait several years to accumulate fully longitudinal data.",Ross Galloway,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4067,University of Edinburgh,"Kate Slaughter, University of Edinburgh

The questions were extracted from a small group, collaborative peer instruction learning environment. The learning environment was chosen because students freely construct dialogue in the genre of questions in such a setting.  We gained insight into the knowledge construction process by capturing and transcribing questions that arose as students i) tried to understand new ideas and ii) tried to deepen their understanding of already learned ideas. We observed, transcribed, coded and sorted the student-initiated questions for analysis. A preliminary finding is a language pattern suggestive of a questioning hierarchy. We coded questions in 3 key categories; strengthening, deepening, and extending understanding. A finer structure of hierarchy was identified by sorting on specific linguistic forms that students used, such as causal statements, counterargument, and metaphor.",Antoinette Stone,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4109,"University of California, Davis, Ca","David Webb, Univeristy of California Davis, Ca.

However, few studies explore how students relate a given resource such as an equation, to various types of physics problems and contexts and they ascertain the meaning and applicability of that resource. We explore how students view physics equations, derive meaning from those equations, and use those equations in physics problem solving. We adapt Dubinsky and McDonalds description of APOS (action-process-object-schema) theory of learning in mathematics, to construct a theoretical framework that describes how students interpret and use equations in physics in terms of actions, processes, objects, and schemas. This framework provides a lens of how students construct their understanding of physics concepts and their relation to equations.

We designed a survey to assess students' ability to apply integration to physics problems in introductory physics.  Each student was given a set of 10 problems, and each set of problems had two different versions; one consisted of symbolic problems and the other graphical problems. Some students were given symbolic problems before graphical problems and others were given the problems in the opposite sequence. The purpose of this study was to investigate students skills in solving integrals they had learned after completing first semester mechanics compared to their skills after completing E&M in the second semester. We also investigated differences between the two sequences of problems.  The results from this integration survey will be presented and discussed.

However, there is no broadly agreed upon definition of what is meant by problem solving.  Most physicists want students to successfully apply a logical yet flexible approach to solving real-world problems significantly different from any they have seen before.  Still, many introductory instructors are primarily concerned with how successfully and thoughtfully students solve standard textbook-style problems.  We report on our continuing efforts to construct and validate a 13-item survey to help assess students' abilities at solving textbook-style problems in the domains of Newtons Laws, momentum, and energy.

4132,Contributed Poster,"Assessing a laboratory-based, inquiry-based algebra course","We discuss the assessment of a laboratory-based, algebra-based physics course, taught in an inquiry-based environment without a text. The course was designed 10 years ago and never fully assessed. The materials, developed with funding from two NSF grants (1), began as a modification of Workshop Physics (2) and evolved to incorporate materials designed for other populations (engineering students, pre-service teachers), modifying and adapting those materials for students in the algebra-based physics course and integrating them with our own materials. It is taught in an inquiry-based environment, with the students working through the materials, performing experiments, developing models (both qualitative and mathematical) and periodic Socratic dialog discussions with the instructors.  We have now assessed the course as part of a large-scale departmental assessment, using conceptual inventories, written pre- and post-tests and scientific attitude surveys, such as CLASS. We present the results and discuss the need to develop more comprehensive assessment instruments.

Vertical transfer is interesting to study, but difficult to measure.  Did the student solve the problem with the desired schema or through a procedural heuristic?  Perhaps the problem cued the student to use certain resources without knowing why.  In this paper, we consider some of the dilemmas and trade-offs encountered in the process of problem design.  Although problems are often published as finished products, we look inside the box.  We map out the problem design space for some problems in calculus-based physics.

We have investigated students' ill-structured problem solving strategies during a capstone project in an upper-division electronics and instrumentation laboratory course. Prior to this project, the students had learned about electronics circuits and devices in this course through mini-lectures and laboratory activities earlier in the semester. Completing the ill-structured capstone project requires students to use their knowledge of electronics to improve the measurements done on a physics experiment they had worked on in a previous semester. As a group, the students proposed ideas to improve the measurement design and then built circuitry to implement this improved design. We describe the activities that students worked on as they completed the capstone project as well as their interactions with each other during this ill-structured task.

Consequently, they have expectations about how they should be taught.

When students encounter a reformed physics class, there is often a misalignment between students perceptions, and learning goals the instructor designed for the students. We want to propose that alignment can be achieved in a reformed physics class by taking a holistic view of the classroom. In other words, it is not just about teaching physics, but a problem of social engineering as well.

4227,Contributed Poster,Designing formative assessment that guides students towards self-directed learning,"Most rubrics are designed to satisfy the following purposes: setting the learning goals, helping the instructor to determine where the students are, providing a scale for assigning grades. In our physics class we would like to achieve one more purpose: to use rubrics to guide students toward self-directed learning. We designed a homework rubric with only three items. This made the rubric easy for students to understand and easy for the instructor to implement. The three-item-rubric focuses on requiring students to reflect on their own thought processes, check consistency between representations, and evaluate the result. In the process, students slowly become accustomed to the complex process of self-directed learning. Through the process of reflection and self-evaluation, students also gain confidence in their own understanding before they receive the instructors feedback.

4108,Contributed Poster,Evidence of embodied cognition about wave propagation,"That students think of wavepulses as if throwing balls down a long taut spring is well established [1,2]. Typical questions involve students imagining the spring already pulled taut; a different scenario would imagine them pulling the spring tight first. This situation creates a different baseline of physical experience from which to reason. For example, it provides an experience in which tension is a relevant measure in the system. We investigated the effects of students pulling the spring (or not) in interviews after instruction. We also wrote two surveys, each giving a different physical description of a typical problem. From interviews, we find evidence that a different embodiment of the problem affects students' responses. In surveys, with students asked to imagine different situations, we found no such evidence.

A great deal of prior research has been conducted to evaluate its validity and reliability, and implement it to gauge students performance. However, all these efforts relied on students raw data entry with the Classical Test Theory (CTT) for analysis. In the present study we applied the Rasch model to investigate the extent to which the BEMA items can measure a single underlying construct, students understanding of E&M.

The students are divided into 10 discussion/labs (DLs) that meet for 140 minutes twice a week and are taught by five teaching assistants (TAs).  Five DLs are autonomy-supportive in that during the second half of each class the students choose how to apply or clarify what they have learned.  We compare this experimental group to a control group of five traditional active-engagement DLs.  Each TA teaches one autonomy-supportive and one traditional DL.  We hypothesize that increased autonomy-support will help improve attitudes, increase interest, and enhance performance.  We measure these effects with specially designed surveys and grades.  This study could have important implications for introductory physics class design by testing whether the positive effects of increased student autonomy in class outweigh the benefits of the instructor making most of the choices for the students.",Nicholas Hall,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4100,"University of California, Davis","David Webb - University of California, Davis",2011

4139,Contributed Poster,Gender Bias in the Force Concept Inventory?,Could the well-established fact that males tend to score higher than females on the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) be due to gender bias in the questions? The eventual answer to the question hinges on the definition of bias. We assert that a question is biased only if a factor other than ability (in this case gender) affects the likelihood that a student will answer the question correctly.  The statistical technique of differential item functioning allows us to control for ability in our analysis of student performance on each of the thirty FCI questions. This method uses the total score on the FCI as the measure of ability. We conclude that the evidence for gender bias in the FCI questions is marginal at best.,Richard D.

4126,Contributed Poster,Investigating Dynamics of Group Learning Using Huddleboards,"This study examined the different modes of group interaction among undergraduate students and their impact on student learning and transfer of learning. A series of group-based, problem- solving activities were designed and implemented throughout a semester in an introductory level physics course. The students were engaged in problem-solving sessions integrated with related laboratory activities using Huddleboards. The sequence of the laboratory activities and problem- solving sessions were altered throughout the semester. Mainly three modes of group interaction were observed: scaffolding mode, converging mode and leading-following mode. This paper describes the strategies used by the students in those modes and also reports the correlation of those modes with the group and individual performances as well as the subsequent transfer of learning. In addition, the impact of sequencing laboratory and problem-solving activities on group performances will be reported.",Bijaya Aryal,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4126,University of Minnesota-Rochester,,2011
4101,Contributed Poster,Investigating students' difficulties with equations involving circuit elements,"We discuss an investigation exploring students' difficulties with equations relating to circuit elements.  We find that introductory physics students have great difficulty understanding, e.g., how the resistance of an Ohmic resistor can be written in terms of the potential difference across it and the current through it, but it does not change when the potential difference across the resistor is varied. Many students believed that there should be only one equation for a physical quantity that should provide the one and only ""solution"" for that physical quantity. They were confused when presented with two separate equations. Similar confusions arose in problems relating to capacitors and inductors.  We discuss these difficulties in the context of introductory physics students' performance on questions about circuit elements both in the free-response and multiple-choice formats and compare their performance to that of the graduate students.This work was supported by NSF.",Jing Li,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4101,University of Pittsburgh,"Chandralekha Singh, University of Pittsburgh",2011

4131,Contributed Poster,Item Response Theory Analysis of the Mechanics Baseline Test,"Item Response Theory (IRT) algorithms are being developed to better assess student performance in our Integrated Learning Environment for Mechanics (ILEM; [1]) implemented in LON-CAPA.    A student's skill, as determined by IRT, provides more information than the traditional student score because it takes into account universally calibrated problem difficulties.  Importantly, it allows determination of skill on a universal scale independent of which questions the student answers.  Our approaches seek to dynamically update student and class skill level in ILEM throughout the course based on their performance, rather than relying primarily on the gain from pre/post testing.  We present results comparing IRT and pre/post gain analysis of the Mechanics Baseline Inventory Test, including discussion of item parameters for the 26 questions on the MBT exam.

In particular, operators corresponding to observables encode important information about the results of quantum measurements. We interviewed upper-level undergraduate physics majors and graduate students about their understanding of the role of operators in quantum measurements. Previous studies have shown that many students think of measurements on quantum systems as being deterministic and that measurements mathematically correspond to operators acting on the initial quantum state. This study is consistent with and expands on these results. We report on how students make sense of a quantum measurement problem involving sequential measurements and the role that the eigenvalue equation plays in this sense-making. We find that although these students recognized the importance of the eigenvalue equation, a misuse of superposition leads to unproductive analyses.",Elizabeth Gire,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4148,University of Memphis,Corinne Manogue,2011

The assessment tool used was the problem-solving rubric developed by the University of Minnesota PER Group (Docktor 2009) designed to measure problem-solving skills along five different dimensions that characterize differences between expert and novice problem solving.

Form is a useful shorthand label for describing the state of a system, which can enable efficient communication, but can also obscure meaning.  When a student uses a label for a form of energy, we do not know what meaning is packed inside that label.  We present video analysis of teachers studying energy in a summer professional development program.  By watching them grapple with a novel form of energy that is not included on standard lists of forms, we can better understand how they think about form in general.

First, a significant fraction of students chose partially-correct responses, and from pre- to post-test, many students moved from misconception to partially correct responses or from partially-correct to fully correct responses. Second, there were asymmetries in responding to conditional relations. For example, students answered questions of the form ""Given the velocity, what can be inferred about the net force?"" differently than converse questions ""Given the net force, what can be inferred about the velocity?"" Third, there were hierarchies in student responses, suggesting for example that understanding the relation between velocity and acceleration is necessary for understanding the relation between velocity and force.

The choice of particular examples is often left to intuition and instructional experience.  In this study, a more theoretical route to example choice is explored using concepts related to projectile motion and the balance-scale.  The contingency model is a computational model that proposes that certain patterns in the co-occurrence of two events can result in the learning of a causal association between the events. Our results demonstrate that different types of examples affect student answers in ways that are mostly consistent with the predictions made by the contingency model. Additionally, when asked to produce a physical ""rule"" to explain their answers, the students' self-reported rules were consistent with contingency model predictions.

Unfortunately, there are always students who fail or receive poor grades. It would be helpful for advisers to identify predictors for success in the course so they could point at-risk students to supporting resources (e.g. tutoring) and/or preparatory courses. To better understand these predictors, a study was conducted with 273 undergraduate students enrolled in a calculus based physics course at a large Midwestern University. Variables examined were: homework, attendance, lab performance, and score on the first exam. The study further investigated whether a student's major or gender was correlated to his/her academic success. Results show that average exam score (which contributes 59% towards the final grade) is highly correlated with lab score, homework average, and attendance (measured by four random checks).

Is it thermal energy, which is indicated by temperature? Is it chemical energy, which is indicated by chemical composition of a substance? [1] Maybe something else?

Their negotiation of the name of this form of energy boiled down to a discussion of the difference between kinetic and potential energy.

4133,Contributed Poster,Student Conversations while Completing Minimally Working Computational Models,"One learning objective of contemporary physics instruction is to introduce students to iterative predictions of motion and to some of the numerical integration techniques used to model problems that lack closed-form solutions. The Matter & Interactions introductory mechanics labs enact this objective by having student groups add the fundamental interactions and relations into a sequence of incomplete, yet functional computational models. We present an initial analysis of student conversations as they work in groups to construct a physically appropriate computational model of Rutherford Scattering. Interestingly, the students are able to invoke appropriate physics knowledge in this novel context, but they can also invoke knowledge of the analytic procedures emphasized in other aspects of the course, leading to confusions over the iterative structure of the computational models.",Brandon Lunk,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4133,NCSU,"Ruth Chabay, NCSU.",2011
4093,Contributed Poster,Student Difficulty with non-Cartesian Unit Vectors in Upper Level E&M,"An upper level E&M course (i.e. based on Griffiths) involves the extensive integration of vector calculus concepts and notation with abstract physics concepts like field and potential.  We hope that students take what they have learned in their math classes and apply it to help represent and make sense of the physics.  To assess how well students are able to do this integration and application I have developed a simple concept test on position and unit vectors in Spherical coordinates. In this poster I describe this concept test and present results that show students at all levels (pre-E&M course, post-E&M course, 1st year graduate students) and in different disciplines (physics, electrical engineering) struggle with using non-Cartesian unit vectors.  A curriculum is being developed to address these difficulties.  Some preliminary results from this curriculum are shown.",Brant Hinrichs,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4093,Drury University,,2011
4122,Contributed Poster,Student Problem Design: Learner-Driven Creation and Evaluation in Physics Assignments,"Writing assignments can be an effective way of getting students to practice higher-order learning skills in physics.  One example of such an assignment is that of problem design.  One version of the problem design assignment asks the student to evaluate the material from a chapter, after all instruction and other activities are complete.  The student is to decide what concepts and ideas are most central, or critical in the chapter, and construct a problem that he or she feels best encompasses the major themes.  Ideally, the designed problem could be given to another student to see if he or she truly understood the important concepts and problemsolving strategies in the chapter.  Students share these problems via Blackboard or another course web shell.  Here, we introduce the assignment and use two concept surveys (FCI and EMCS) to attempt to measure conceptual gains for students completing the problem design assignment.",Eric Mandell,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4122,Bowling Green State University,,2011
4102,Contributed Poster,Student Understanding of Taylor Series Expansions in Statistical Mechanics,"One goal of physics instruction is to have students learn to make physical meaning of specific mathematical ideas, concepts, and procedures in different physical settings. As part of research investigating student learning in statistical physics, we are developing curriculum materials that guide students through a derivation of the Boltzmann factor, using a Taylor series expansion of entropy. Using results from written surveys, classroom observations, and both individual think-aloud and teaching interviews, we present evidence that, while many students can recognize and interpret series expansions, they often lack fluency with the Taylor series, despite previous exposures in both calculus and physics courses. We present students' successes and failures both using and interpreting Taylor series expansions in a variety of physical contexts.",Trevor I.

In this study, introductory-level physics students were given a set of pure math problems and a set of physics problems that required them to use the exact same mathematical processes.  The students were then asked to pair the analogous problems and explain the pairings.  Presented here are the results of that study, which support previous findings that students have difficulty determining how the two are connected and give some insight into what can be done to help scaffold that connection in the future.",Dyan McBride,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4024,Mercyhurst College,,2011

Few PER studies have distinguished between difficulties students have with physics concepts and those with either mathematics concepts, application of those concepts, or the representations used to connect the math and the physics. We are conducting empirical studies of student responses to mathematics questions dealing with graphical representations of  (single-variable) integration. Reasoning in written responses could roughly be put into three major categories related to particular features of the graphs: area under the curve, position of the function, and shape of the curve. In subsequent individual interviews, we varied representational features to explore the depth and breadth of the contextual nature of student reasoning, with an emphasis on negative integrals. Results suggest an incomplete understanding of the criteria that determine the sign of a definite integral.",Rabindra Bajracharya,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4096,University of Maine,"John R.

4170,Contributed Poster,Students Reconciling Contradictory Commitments in Damped Harmonic Motion Problems,"In intermediate and advanced physics courses, students are expected to use mathematical, graphical, and physical reasoning, as well as their intuitions. These intuitions may contradict each other and can be inconsistent with ideas developed during small group learning activities. On the topic of damped harmonic motion, students have intuitions about the mathematics, the physics, and the way the graph of the motion should look. Students remain committed to some of these intuitions to the point of not using provided instructional resources. They also deal with contradictions when their commitments to one kind of reasoning conflict with their commitments to another (e.g., the analysis of a mathematical derivation conflicts with that of a free-body diagram summarizing physical reasoning). These multiple commitments have an effect on students' classroom discussion and the way that students reconcile contradictory commitments and conclusions.",Adam Kaczynski,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4170,University of Maine,"Michael C.

4088,Contributed Poster,Students' Views of Macroscopic and Microscopic Energy in Physics and Biology,"Energy concepts are fundamental across the sciences, yet these concepts can be fragmented along disciplinary boundaries, rather than integrated into a coherent whole.   To teach physics effectively to biology students, we need to understand students' disciplinary perspectives.  We present interview data from an undergraduate student who displays multiple stances towards the concept of energy.  At times he views energy in macroscopic contexts as a separate entity from energy in microscopic (particularly biological) contexts, while at other times he uses macroscopic physics phenomena as productive analogies for understanding energy in the microscopic biological context, and he reasons about energy transformations between the microscopic and macroscopic scales.  This case study displays preliminary evidence for the context dependence of students' ability to translate energy concepts across scientific disciplines.  This points to challenges that must be taken into account in developing curricula for biology students that integrate physics and biology concepts.",Benjamin W.

4156,Contributed Poster,"TRUSE Conference: Integrating undergraduate physics, chemistry and mathematics education research","In June 2010, the first of two biennial conferences on Transforming Research in Undergraduate STEM Education (TRUSE) brought together researchers in undergraduate physics, mathematics, and chemistry education to transform and integrate research across disciplines. The format included plenary talks, working groups, poster sessions and substantial unstructured time to network with colleagues and build capacity for future investigations.  Research described included projects that exemplify particular disciplinary approaches; work on trans-disciplinary topics such as transfer, representations, and reasoning strategies; and investigations on content topics that cross one or more disciplinary boundaries. After the conference, mini-grants were solicited for seed projects that could lead to longer-term interdisciplinary collaborations. A summary of the conference will be given with descriptions of sample presentations and implications for PER. The organizers will be running the conference again in 2012 with at least one more discipline being included.

Streamline to Mastery is an NSF funded learner-centered professional development program that seeks to capitalize on teachers knowledge and experience to move newer physics teachers toward mastery in their fields. Teacher participants in this teacher-driven program choose their own goals and areas of growth. One of these areas has been the development and implementation of inquiry-oriented curriculum, as well as the adaptation of traditional lessons to a greater inquiry orientation.

During the course of instruction, two of the eight tables in the room were audio and video recorded.  We examine the practices of the GTAs and LAs in interacting with the students through both qualitative and quantitative analyses of these recordings.

4103,Contributed Poster,Teaching Assistants Reasons for the Design of Problem Solutions for Introductory Physics: Findings,"As part of a larger study to understand how instructors make teaching decisions, we investigated how graduate teaching assistants (TAs) perceive features of written problem solutions. TAs are an important population to understand; they often provide significant instruction and they also represent the pool of future physics faculty. Twenty-four first-year graduate TAs enrolled in a training course were provided with different instructor solutions for the same physics problem and asked to discuss their preferences for prominent solution features. Preliminary findings reveal that providing a schematic visualization of the problem, listing knowns/unknowns and explaining reasoning in explicit words were the most valued features. Preferences for different features were sometimes in conflict with each other. For example, while the TAs valued solutions where reasoning was explicitly explained, they also valued concise solution. We'll present the reasons behind these preferences and discuss the implications for the professional developments of physics TAs.",Edit Yerushalmi,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4103,Weizmann Institute of Science,"Shih-Yin Lin, University of Pittsburgh

4164,Contributed Poster,Teaching Physics to Life Science Students  Examining The Role of Biological Context,"In the cognitive apprenticeship model, learning occurs most effectively in an environment of expert practice, in which students can articulate why what they are learning matters to them. Studies of transfer suggest that for students to successfully apply physics to another scientific field, it is important to study applications to that field.  Guided by this theoretical framework, we restructured our introductory physics courses for life science and premedical students around biologically rich contexts  examples in which physics plays a significant role in understanding a biological system  to make explicit the value of physics to the life sciences, and modified the syllabus to reflect the topics most relevant to these students. In this paper we describe our approaches to this course, summarize preliminary results, and identify future research directions addressing (1) the role of biological context in learning for these students and (2) issues in implementing such a course for physics faculty.",Catherine H.

4037,Contributed Poster,Teaching assistants' interactions with their students: Exploring changes in teaching methods through conversational shifts.,"Teaching assistants (TAs) use multiple conversational methods when interacting with their students, yet they often do not choose the most appropriate methods to help students construct their knowledge of physics. TAs can affect learning in ways that professors cannot, as they typically get more one-on-one time in multiple settings, but they are not making the best use of their opportunities to help students. The goal of this study is to analyze emergent patterns in the interactions when conversation between TA and students shifts from more constructive methods to less constructive methods, and vice versa. �We explore the circumstances that trigger these shifts in the conversation and how TAs conversational methods change with these shifts. We will present preliminary data from the studio laboratory sections of the Matter and Interactions introductory mechanics course showing the patterns that emerge for different TAs.",Meghan J.

Overall, the course transformations improved student learning, as measured by our conceptual assessment.  Since these transformations were multi-faceted, we would like to understand the impact of individual course elements. Attendance at tutorials and homework help sessions was optional, and occurred outside the class environment.  In order to identify the impact of these optional out-of-class sessions, given self-selection effects in student attendance, we performed a multiple regression analysis.  Even when background variables are taken into account, tutorial attendance is positively correlated with student conceptual understanding of the material  though not with performance on course exams.

4053,Contributed Poster,The Effect of High-Stake Testing on Students Learning Approaches in Physics,"Turkish high school physics students applying to college must take a university entrance exam. This study investigated the effects of this test on students' approaches to learning physics.  On a survey, tenth grade students first indicated how they study, then discussed how they would advise a hypothetical student, Arzu, to study, where Arzu plans to attend college in another country where no high-stakes entrance exam is used. As Elby (1999) found in a similar study, the students reported very different study approaches for themselves vs. for Arzu. Their learning approaches included mostly surface level learning strategies, such as studying formulas and rote practice problems, while their advice for Arzu contained mostly deeper-level learning strategies, such as studying concepts and relating what is learned in the class to everyday life. The students were explicit in attributing this difference to the university entrance examination.

4137,Contributed Poster,The effect of immigration status on physics identity and physical science career intentions,"Using data collected from a nationally-representative sample of first-year college students, we examine how students' identity development as physics persons and their likelihood to pursue a career in physical science is predicted by differing immigrant experiences. We consider broad factors having a social, economic, or cultural nature as covariates in a propensity score model that assesses differences due to immigrant generation. Our results show that, when controlling for such factors as race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, and gender, students' physics identities and the likelihood of choosing a career in physical science are significantly higher amongst first generation students than second generation (or later) students. We conclude that physical science as a career option can be influenced by the experiences of being an immigrant and through the relationship between origin and host culture.",Geoff Potvin,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4137,"Department of Engineering & Science Education, and Department of Mathematical Sciences","Florin Lung

4135,Contributed Poster,To What Extent Is Seeing Not Believing?,"Demonstrations (demos) are a vital component of most introductory physics courses. Despite the presence of demonstrations in undergraduate physics, research has shown that students learn little, if anything from lecture demos. In addition, some research suggests that demos may even contribute to students misconceptions, depending on how they are delivered. We analyze one delivery method that requires students predictions of lecture demonstration outcomes in introductory mechanics and electricity and magnetism at two large research universities. We compare students predictions before having seen the demonstration to what they report as having observed both right after the demonstration and several weeks later. Students' post-demonstration explanations of the physics behind each demonstration are also analyzed. Triangulation of these data points lead us to better understand how pre-instructional beliefs influence student interpretation and persistent understanding of physics lecture demonstrations. This can mitigate the disconnect that has been shown to exist between what instructors think they are demonstrating and what students actually observe/remember.",Kelly Miller,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4135,Harvard University,,2011
4151,Contributed Poster,Toward an Analytic Framework of Physics Teaching Assistants' Pedagogical Knowledge,"As research-based instructional strategies become more widespread, increasing attention is being paid to the instructional role of Teaching Assistants (TAs), as well as the impact of the teaching experience on the TAs own pedagogical development. In previous work [1], we began documenting TA beliefs and presented two contrasting case studies of TA beliefs about teaching physics. In this paper, we begin to build a framework that extends the work on beliefs to identify categories of epistemological and pedagogical resources that TAs draw upon when talking about and when engaging in teaching practices. By applying this framework to observations and interviews of TAs from an introductory physics course, we demonstrate emergent differences in how these instructors talk about their own teaching, as well as examples of how these differences appear to be reflected in their framing of the instructional activity. We conclude with implications for teacher preparation and professional development at the graduate level.

4173,Contributed Poster,Towards a Better Understanding of Confusion,"Physics instructors typically try to avoid confusing their students. However, the truism underlying this approach, ""confusion is bad,"" has been challenged by educators dating as far back as Socrates, who asked students to question assumptions and wrestle with ideas. This begs the question: Are confused students lost, or does their confusion indicate more critical thinking than less-confused learners? In previous work, we focused on a single reading assignment, a snapshot. Insights from this work allowed us to refine and expand our study to over 40 snapshots that span two semesters of introductory physics, which involved Just-in-Time Teaching and research-based reading materials.  We evaluated performance on assignments while simultaneously asking students to self-assess their confusion over the material, and then probed whether confused students were correct more or less frequently than not-confused students.

4040,Contributed Poster,Understanding the Variable Effect of Course Innovations on Student Learning,"Over the last several decades, research has challenged the efficacy of the traditional lecture-based instructional model of undergraduate physics education. As a result, a large number of reform-oriented instructional innovations have been developed, enacted, and studied in undergraduate physics courses. While previous work has shown that the impact of course innovations on student learning has been overwhelmingly positive, it has also been highly variable. The purpose of this analysis is to investigate this variability. For this analysis 170 published studies on undergraduate physics course innovations were coded with respect to the characteristics of the innovations as well as the methodological characteristics of the study designs. The findings of this analysis have indicated that nearly half of the variability can be accounted for by study design characteristics rather than by characteristics of the innovations used. However, a subsequent analysis has highlighted some of the critical characteristics of more effective innovations.",Heidi Iverson,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4040,Colorado State University,,2011
4086,Contributed Poster,Use of Question Formatting in Relation to Cognitive Assessment,"We discuss the effect of problem format on students responses. We focus on the information gained about the students thinking processes and knowledge structures as related to the content being assessed. We present data indicating that when students are required to show their calculations and/or explain their reasoning, the instructor has evidence of the level of scientific thinking, or the use of elements of cognitive structure, such as phenomenological primitives (p-prims). We also show data indicating that when the format of multiple choice is compared to other formats (for the same problem), such as explain your reasoning, ranking or  multiple choice with explain your reasoning that the number of students answering completely correctly drops dramatically. Our data indicates that the use of multiple choice as the form of assessment 1) does not give instructors information on the thinking processes of the students and 2) masks the fact that a significant number of students do not get to the correct answer by a consistent and coherent reasoning process.

In this study, we examine introductory students ability to learn from analogical problem solving between two problems that are similar in the application of physics principle (Newtons 2nd Law) but one problem involves friction which often triggers the misleading notion. Students from algebra- and calculus- based introductory physics courses were asked in a quiz to take advantage of what they learned from a solved problem provided, which was about tension in a rope, to solve another problem involving friction. To help students process through the analogy deeply and contemplate the applicability of associating the frictional force with its maximum value, students in different recitation classrooms received different scaffolding.

4163,Contributed Poster,Using Cogenerative Mediation to Assess an Aspect of Classroom Culture,"We present results of an action research project showing a class of pre-service elementary teachers (and their instructors) valuing different learning preferences at two different times during one semester of a Physics and Everyday Thinking course. This was observed using a cogenerative mediation process in which participants discussed individual preferences in order to collectively develop classroom goals near the beginning and again near the end of the course. Throughout the semester, instructors made conscious efforts to raise awareness of this aspect of classroom culture.  The data show a shift from passive (lecturing, giving a study guide, offering incentives), to more active preferences (note-taking, organization, opportunistic learning). As a result of the cogenerative process, changes were made to the course in order to facilitate teaching and learning the nature of science, in ways sensitive to everyones preferences. That sensitivity was informed by both academic literature and the specific classroom culture.",Natan Samuels,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4163,"Florida International University, Dept. of Teaching & Learning","Eric Brewe, Florida International University, Department of Teaching & Learning

4056,Contributed Poster,Using Johnson-Laird's cognitive framework of sense-making to characterize engineering students' mental representations in kinematics,"The study investigates the kinds of mental representations constructed by engineering students at Kansas State University when solving problems in the context of kinematics. A cohort of 19 students completed six non-directed tasks posed in different representational forms (mathematical, linguistic and graphical) requiring the generation of linguistic or mathematical models. Individual interviews were conducted immediately after completing the tasks. Based on the students' actions when solving the problems together with their interview responses, two main profiles emerged from the data. Johnson-Laird (1983) cognitive framework was then related to the profiles for inferring about the categories of cognitive structures. The framework proposes three types of internal constructs: propositional representations, mental models and mental images. It is argued that comprehension occurs upon the construction of mental models. However, this study revealed that 11 in 19 participants are classified as using propositional representation while the remaining students construct a mental image.

4111,Contributed Poster,Using Verbalizations To Understand How Students Think About Integration In Introductory Electromagnetism Contexts,Students in introductory physics have difficulties when applying calculus to physics problems.  The application of integration to physical situations is especially challenging yet it is crucial to several of the electromagnetism concepts taught in a typical second semester introductory course.  Understanding how students make sense of and apply integration to different physical situations could help guide future instructional development.  Individual interviews were conducted where students talked about their solution approaches for different electric field and electric potential difference problems involving the use of integrals.  A classification scheme developed to understand how students are talking about these problems will be presented.  Evidence from these interviews suggests that students approach integration in these two contexts differently.  The implications that this observation might have on instructional design will be discussed.,Jeffrey M.

4143,Contributed Poster,Using similarity ratings surveys to assess deep-structure feature emphasis during problem comparison,"Effective problem solvers are often capable of distinguishing deep-structure similarities and differences between problems (Chi et. al., 1981; Jonassen, 2000).  A pilot study conducted in the spring of 2010 provided further evidence that compare and contrast activities implemented in weekly homework assignments over a semester-long, introductory algebra-based physics course facilitated students emphasis on deep-structure details between problems.  This study also revealed a direct correlation between deep-structure emphasis and physical content (e.g., simple harmonic motion, DC circuits). To evaluate the emphasis students placed in deep-structure features, students completed pre- and post- similarity ratings surveys.  A continuation study was completed in the spring of 2011 using a similar in-class treatment, but with different content coverage in the post-treatment surveys.  We will report on the pre- and post-treatment similarity ratings for both studies, and the resultant implications.",Frances Mateycik,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4143,Penn State Altoona,"Kendra E.

Instead of relying solely upon traditional survey-type evaluations,  We have conducted focus group interviews of students at the conclusion of various introductory physics courses (talk about which courses, i.e. experimental sections of the 2-semester University Physics sequence and from an experimental section of physical science).  These mini-focus groups of 1-4 students are conducted by an interviewer who has nothing to do with the teaching and/or grading of the class taken by the student participants.

We have shown that students who used the virtual manipulative (a computer simulation) before performing a physical experiment more frequently provided the correct response to multiple-choice questions about work.  In this paper, we further analyze students responses to a series of questions about work in the context of inclined planes to explore the models students used to answer the questions.  While it is possible that students who performed the physical experiment were getting penalized on the multiple-choice questions for answering in accordance with their observations (i.e. a longer ramp requires more work due to frictional effects), we actually observe students more frequently using an alternate model that a longer ramp requires less work.",Jacquelyn J.

Those of us who use pyramid exams are convinced that students learn more from the test-taking experience than they would with a traditional, individual-only exam. But what do students actually DO in these situations? To address this question, we did some data-mining. Using data on students' answers and scores on each question of the exam and comparing their individual responses to the responses they chose while in the group (where group members were not required to agree), we examined the ways that students change their responses (or don't) from the individual to the group phase, and identified patterns of individual and group behavior.",Ian D.

We found that the instruments were limited in scope and not sufficient to generate an accurate assessment of all aspects of the laboratory implementation. The conceptual inventories assessed both lecture and lab and did not assess problem solving, modeling, aspects of critical thinking or laboratory skills. The locally written pre- and post-tests were limited in coverage. However, they did give information on students' thinking processes, laboratory and problem solving skills.

They should have a strong sense of how theory and experiment relate and how applications play out in the real world.  Above all, we want our majors to be self-confident problem-solvers who identify themselves as professionals, capable of learning new content and skills as necessary, and of working effectively in both independent and team environments.

Strategies include frequent formative assessment in the form of written ungraded quizzes as well as the inclusion of qualitative written problems on graded quizzes and exams.  Examples of assessment items and student responses will be shown.  In particular, we will show evidence that students at this level respond more positively to 'pretests' than one might expect, suggesting more expert-like epistemological expectations than is often the case in the introductory course.

Here, we discuss a study in which two carefully designed research-based multiple-choice questions were transformed into free-response format and implemented on an exam in a calculus-based introductory physics course. Students' performance on the free-response questions was graded twice, first by using a rubric, and secondly by converting the answers back to one of the choices in the original multiple-choice format. There was an excellent match between the different free-response answers and the original choices in the multiple-choice questions.

However, the elicitation, assessment, and subsequent instruction that characterize proximal formative assessment are also seen in discourse among peers. We present a case in which secondary teachers in a professional development course at SPU are discussing energy flow in refrigerators.  In this episode, a peer is invited to share her thinking (elicitation). Her idea that refrigerators move heat from a relatively cold compartment to a hotter environment is inappropriately judged as incorrect (assessment). The ""instruction"" (peer explanation) that follows is based on the second law of thermodynamics, and acts as corrective rather than collaborative. The episode highlights the importance for proximal formative assessment of reserving judgment on learners' ideas until their strengths and weaknesses are well understood.",Benedikt W.

The role of assessment has been critical at three very different scales: (1) Formative assessment focused on the course itself in the design phase; (2) Formative assessment focused on students in the instructional phase; and (3) Summative assessment to determine student performance and the success of course design. We summarize the role and nature of assessments at each of these levels.  At the design scale, investigative measures include observations and surveys of students and student work. In the classroom, assessments to determine and address student difficulties include clicker questions, class activities, and tutorials. At the summative scale, assessments include faculty interviews and course and tutorial-scale posttests.

However, newest innovative curricula aim not only to improve content knowledge, but also include helping students develop practices and skills of authentic scientists. To students, this is often very different from their previous learning experiences in terms of behavioral expectations, attitude, and what learning means. Consequently, students must modify their identity as learners to participate productively in this learning environment. Current assessments are very good at measuring development of conceptual understanding, basic scientific reasoning, and attitudes toward science, but do not address issues specific to these innovative  courses.  We developed a 49-item survey to assess students' 1) expectations of student and teacher roles, 2) self efficacy towards skills supported in the Investigative Science Learning Environment and 3) attitudes towards social learning.

We also use explicit matrix representations of operators and ask students to translate between the Dirac and matrix languages.  The projection of the state onto a basis is represented with a histogram.  When we subsequently introduce wave functions, the wave function attains a natural interpretation as the continuous limit of these discrete histograms or of a projection of a Dirac ket onto position or momentum eigenstates.

The symbolic representation of a partial derivative and related quantities present difficulties for students in both mathematical and physical contexts, most notably what it means to keep one or more variables fixed while taking the derivative with respect to a different variable. Material properties are themselves written as partial derivatives of various state functions (e.g., compressibility is a partial derivative of volume with respect to pressure).  Research in courses at the University of Maine and Oregon State University yields findings related to the many ways that partial derivatives can be represented and interpreted in thermodynamics. Research has informed curricular development that elicits many of the difficulties using different representations (e.g., geometric) and different contexts (e.g., connecting partial derivatives to specific experiments).",John R.

4208,Gallery Session Poster,Supporting Proximal Formative Assessment with Relational Discourse,"The practice of proximal formative assessment depends on students' sharing their ideas with instructors and on teachers' attending to them.  Normal classroom conditions, characterized by mutual evaluation and attention to learning targets, present threats to students' and teachers' sense of their own competence and value.  Students who feel threatened tend to conceal their ideas; teachers who feel threatened have difficulty attending to students' ideas.  This necessary self-protection on the part of learners and teachers depletes the classroom of information that could be valuable for instruction.  In contrast, discourse patterns characterized by positive anticipation and attention to learner ideas increase the potential for proximal formative assessment and promote self-directed learning.  Episodes of classroom video illustrate these effects.",Rachel E. Scherr,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4208,Seattle Pacific University,"Hunter G.

4199,Gallery Session Poster,Time-dependent Interpretation of Correct Responses to Multiple-Choice Questions,"Students' reasoning regarding electric field concepts was analyzed by pre- and post-instruction responses to two related questions on the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism; both multiple-choice responses and written explanations were examined. Although nearly half of all students gave correct pre-instruction responses on one of the questions, their written explanations made it clear that many either based their correct answers on vague or inconsistent ""intuitive"" thinking, or they simply guessed. These explanations, along with inconsistent responses on the related question, showed that most correct pretest answers on this item were not genuinely indicative of conceptual understanding. By contrast, most correct post-instruction responses to the same question were accompanied by acceptable explanations, as well as by matching correct responses on the related item. Thus the same (correct) response on a particular multiple-choice question had dramatically different interpretations regarding students' thinking depending on whether it had been given pre- or post-instruction.",David E.

4204,Gallery Session Poster,What a Mathematical Representation Tells Us About Reasoning About Integrals,"When solving two integrals arising from the separation of variables in a first order linear differential equation, students have multiple correct choices for how to proceed. They might set limits on both integrals, use integration constants on both, or on only one equation. In each case, the physical meaning of the mathematics is equivalent. But, how students choose to represent the mathematics can tell us much about what they are thinking. Typically, limits indicate more physical thinking, constants more mathematical thinking. Furthermore, evidence for the way they interpret the physical situation is found in choices of limits or constants. At the University of Maine, using a resources (knowledge-in-pieces) framework, we organize these results to show the many skills needed in solving seemingly simple integrals.",Michael C.

4217,Gallery Session Poster,Working with Computational Anxiety: Assessing Student Affect in Learning Computation in Introductory Mechanics,"An introductory physics course at Georgia Tech requires students learn numerical computation for describing physical phenomenon that are not amenable to being solved using analytic methods. Students' motivation to learn computation and anxiety about solving computational exercises varies greatly. The attitudes, interests, and values that students exhibit when learning a subject can play a role in their motivation to and anxiety about learning the subject. We present a brief overview of the development of a new tool, the Computation Modeling in Physics Attitudinal Student Survey (COMPASS), aimed at helping to characterize students' attitudes about, interests in, and values concerning computation as well as preliminary measurements derived from this instrument.",Matthew A.

4186,Invited Talk,"Assessment Lessons from K-12 Education Research: Knowledge Representation, Learning, and Motivation","For 30 years, research on the effects of high-stakes testing in K-12 schools has documented the negative effects of teaching to the test.  Most obvious is the reduction or elimination of time spent on science and social studies instruction, especially in high poverty schools.  Less obvious is the harm to student learning in reading and mathematics when instruction is limited to repetitive drill on worksheets that closely resemble test formats.  The lack of generalized, flexible understanding of underlying principles in K-12 tested subjects is similar to Mazur's experience with plug-and-chug versus conceptual test questions.  The PER community is well aware of the importance of more complete representation of learning goals as a remedy to this problem.  Equally important, however, are the assessment ""processes,"" especially feedback and grading, that can either promote or deter students' engagement and willingness to take responsibility for their own learning.  In this talk, I summarize learning and motivation research that has particular bearing on effective classroom assessment practices, in K-12 classrooms certainly, but even in university courses.",Lorrie Shepard,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4186,University of Colorado,,2011
4025,Invited Talk,"Complex interactions between formative assessment, technology, and classroom practices","Interactive engagement (IE) methods provide instructors with evidence of student thinking that can guide instructional decisions across a range of timescales: facilitating an activity, determining the flow of activities, or modifying the curriculum. Thus, from the instructor's perspective, IE activities can function as formative assessments. As a practical matter, the ability to utilize this potential depends on how the activities are implemented. This talk will describe different tools for small group problem solving, including whiteboards, Tablet PCs, digital cameras, and photosharing websites. These tools provide the instructor with varying levels access to student work during and after class, and therefore provide a range of support for formative assessment. Furthermore, they differ in physical size, ease of use, and the roles for students and instructor. These differences lead to complex, often surprising interactions with classroom practices.",Edward Price,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4025,California State University San Marcos,,2011

How do we determine whether students are attaining our objectives? How can we use this information to improve student outcomes? Questions about defining and assessing competence are at the heart of the science education enterprise and they continue to challenge educators across K-16+.  This presentation will provide concrete examples of how best to frame and address these issues using examples drawn from my work on the redesign of AP science courses and exams, my participation in developing the NRC Conceptual Framework for new Science Education Standards, and ongoing research on the validity and utility of instruments such as STEM concept inventories.  A major point of the presentation is that principled assessment design should be an essential and driving part of the process of designing powerful and effective science learning environments.",James W.

4066,Invited Talk,Standards-based grading with voice: Listening for students' understanding,"Standards-based grading is gaining popularity at the high school level, including physics courses. The basic notion is to give your students a list of objectives upfront that they need to master. Students can reassess often and their final grade is determined solely by their last reassessment on each standard. Its the instructors job to help students find ways of showing their mastery to you. I implemented this in a junior-level mechanics course where the small numbers allowed me to introduce a novel twist: all assessments had to include students voice. This meant that students turned in pencasts, screencasts, and in-person assessments. Several days were also set aside for collaborative oral assessments, where students offered up honest advice and scores were mutually determined. In this talk, Ill share my experience trying out this pedagogical experiment and try to convey how it has improved my  own understanding of my students understanding.",Andy Rundquist,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4066,Hamline University,,2011
4033,Invited Talk,Student Engagement in Disciplinary Assessment,"Assessment in classrooms is often viewed as the responsibility of teachers. They typically serve as the ones judge the quality of work and advise students about necessary steps to make progress towards conceptual gains. By and large, then, assessment is something done by teachers to students.  When students are involved in assessment, it is often as recipients and users of feedback from teachers. There's an analog to this in science.  Assessment encompasses the process of peer review, when community members make judgments about the quality of work and provide feedback in reviews, and when funders decide whether to provide support to a research program.  However, in science, assessment also operates on a different level; assessment of ideas is intimately connected to doing science. In this talk, we examine the relationship between assessment and learning in science and in schools. We argue for engaging students in disciplinary assessment activities and for better coordinating the different purposes and roles for assessment.",Janet Coffey,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4033,University of Maryland,"David Hammer, Tufts University",2011

However, computation is virtually ignored in most introductory college courses. 

In this targeted session, we present an overview of efforts to introduce computation undertaken in both high school and large enrollment university mechanics courses. Several key questions are highlighted for discussion. How can computation be introduced into courses that have a wide variety of student skill levels? How can students' abilities to use computer modeling be evaluated? What challenges do students face when developing a computer model? What is the role of epistemology for students who are learning this new tool?",Marcos D Caballero,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4043,"Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Physics","John B.

4114,Poster Gallery Session,Moving Beyond Conceptual Inventories,"Many instructors across the country, particularly those teaching by non-traditional methods or interested in modifying their teaching techniques or curricula, find themselves in need of a more comprehensive assessment instrument. They would like to evaluate their instructional methods through a broader assessment of their students skills, including laboratory, modeling (conceptual and mathematical), problem solving and critical thinking skills, assessed in the context of physics. They would like an instrument that can be used to compare their students performance to that of other students nationwide.

 In this targeted poster session, we will discuss the pros and cons of existing assessment instruments, which include assessments such as conceptual inventories and pre- and post-testing (mostly local), present work on assessments that go beyond conceptual inventories, and the need for broader, more comprehensive assessments, including examples of assessment instruments that might be useful to serve as a prototype.",Beth Thacker,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4114,Texas Tech University,,2011
4106,Poster Gallery Session,Multiple Assessments of Multiple-choice Assessments,"Multiple-choice tests are used frequently in physics education as tools for assessing student learning.  These assessments are often used to evaluate research-based curricula/pedagogies because they can be administered to a large student population, and are easy to grade, compare and analyze quantitatively.  However, even with research-based multiple-choice tests, students' thought process is not revealed very well by the test answers alone. This session will showcase posters with examples of research highlighting advantages and limitations of multiple-choice assessments. These issues include correlation between students' performance on carefully designed multiple-choice tests and the same problems administered in a free-response format and graded on a rubric, gender effects, and other factors.",Chandralekha Singh,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4106,University of Pittsburgh,"Jing Li, University of Pittsburgh",2011
4147,Poster Gallery Session,Proximal Formative Assessment,"Classically, formative assessment has been considered in terms of changes made to lesson plans as a result of diagnostic testing.  Proximal formative assessment is teachers' continual, responsive attention to learners' developing understanding as it is expressed verbally moment to moment:  the process by which teachers carefully attend to specific aspects of individual learners' developing understanding, as instruction is taking place in real time (Erickson, 2007; Heritage, 2010).  This is among the most subtle and challenging of formative assessment practices, yet is the one with perhaps the most potential impact on a teacher's ongoing activities in the classroom.

4160,Round Table Presentation,Assessment of student-driven multi-level homework,"We are investigating interactions with student-driven, multi-level homework as part of our Integrated Learning Environment for Mechanics.  Student-driven means that students choose their assignment from a set of easy (fewest points), medium, and hard (most points) problems subject to accruing a specific number of total points.  Problem levels were determined a priori based on the cognitive load of the required tasks [1] and our opinion of overall challenge.  We are assessing student interactions and performance on these problems in a number of ways: item response theory, time on task, and choice of level. We will present our findings and discuss further studies of the impact that multi-level, student-driven assignments have on students learning.

4175,Round Table Presentation,Designing formative assessment that guides students towards self-directed learning,"Most rubrics are designed to satisfy the following purposes: setting the learning goals, helping the instructor to determine where the students are, providing a scale for assigning grades. In our physics class we would like to achieve one more purpose: to use rubrics to guide students toward self-directed learning. We designed a homework rubric with only three items. This made the rubric easy for students to understand and easy for the instructor to implement. The three-item-rubric focuses on requiring students to reflect on their own thought processes, check consistency between representations, and evaluate the result. In the process, students slowly become accustomed to the complex process of self-directed learning. Through the process of reflection and self-evaluation, students also gain confidence in their own understanding before they receive the instructors feedback. By the end of the semester students were able to demonstrate the ability to learn on their own.",Yuhfen Lin,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4175,Florida International University,"David T.

Having them attempt homework problems prior to class enables them to be better prepared to ask specific questions about concepts and to perform on exams, as well as to develop as self learners. This paper will introduce phased-array homework which is a flexible system of assigning homework. In addition, this paper discusses resources for students that provide a scaffold for completing this type of homework. As the name of the homework system implies, phased-array homework (PAH) allows an instructor to shape and steer student understanding in much the same way that a phased-array antenna allows for the shaping and steering of a transmitted electromagnetic signal to yield its subsequent effective radiation pattern.

4121,Round Table Presentation,Reasoning with Physical Models,"Model-based reasoning in physics requires, among other skills, the use of deductive reasoning.  In two different contexts -- pencil and paper problems requiring qualitative reasoning, and computational activities modeling system dynamics -- we have observed that many science and engineering students in the introductory calculus-based course do not appear to be employing even simple formal deductive logic.   One of our studies focuses on modeling student deductive reasoning as a search through possibility space.  Another study focuses on designing tasks to keep students focused on a model rather than intuitive guessing, by asking them to predict the behavior of an incomplete model.  Understanding how students actually approach model-based deduction can inform the design of instruction in this and future courses (especially relativity and quantum mechanics) that rely heavily on students' ability to reason formally and their confidence in the results of such reasoning.",Ruth Chabay,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4121,North Carolina State University,"Jonathan D.H.

In particular, the roles of superior content knowledge, of pedagogical content knowledge, and of experience in teaching have been identified as important factors.  The present study examines the role of teacher reasoning ability. Reasoning ability was assessed in four different introductory physics courses with varying degrees of inquiry-based instruction.  An analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant differences in gains between inquiry-based formats and traditional, lecture-based courses in favor of the active learning teaching style. The significance of this on the training of pre-service teachers as well as the professional development of in-service teachers is discussed in view of a second study which indicates that teachers scientific reasoning ability correlates extremely well with the measured scientific reasoning ability of the students they have taught.",Bruce R Patton,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2011/detail.cfm?ID=4161,The Ohio State University,"Jennifer L Esswein, Department of Physics, The Ohio State University
