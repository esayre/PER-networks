5827,Contributed Poster Presentation,3rd year university physics students reasoning on physical information encoded in quantum state at a point in time,"Learning quantum mechanics (QM) entails adopting a new reference frame for the physical interpretation of the world. The quantum perspective is intrinsically connected with math, which becomes a sort of referent for physical meaning, requiring the employment of new formal structures and a new interpretation of familiar ones. Different approaches in teaching QM evidenced that students struggle to draw qualitative inferences from quantitative tools. Within a research conducted in the framework of the Model of Educational Reconstruction, a 15-item questionnaire was administered to 40 physics students of three Italian universities. Semi-structured interviews were scheduled on a subset of students. Results concerning the transposition of experimental outcomes in quantum state formalism and its physical interpretation show that students mostly focus on square modulus in order to reason on physical information encoded in the state, thus neglecting phase and reconstructing the state by means of one measurement.",Giacomo Zuccarini,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5827,University of Udine,Marisa Michelini,2014

It aims at building conceptual understanding of relativistic momentum and kinetic energy; it exploits thought experiments and historically relevant ones, illustrates scientific modeling by induction and draws on relativistic invariant quantities. A simulation of light-clock was run, for constructing representations of time dilation effect. As for global learning the path effectiveness was assessed by comparing pre- and post-test. General interpretive written questions were asked during the teaching/learning process to find out intermediate explanatory models, reasoning patterns, problem solving skills in similar contexts. The analysis of interplay between the former and the latter sequence of replies is presented.

From all the attributes included in the scientific literacy, we measured the attitudes toward science and learning of science of high school science teachers in a scientific literacy course in Mexico to analyze how these attitudes are related to the development of their classroom activities. We used the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (C-LASS) with 310 high school teachers. Most of the teachers who participated in this study were university graduates, so we considered the use of this survey was adequate to explore their attitudes. The results show that teachers have better attitudes toward learning physics than those reported in the literature for college students. Real world connection and Personal interest were the highest categories achieved, while Conceptual understanding and Problem solving sophistication were the lowest. We analyzed whether teachers promoted the development of attitudes toward science in their planned activities required for the course.

Namely, students struggle more with graphs in which the variables have no relation or an unknown relationship than with typical graphs where the data shows a relationship.

First, many students incorrectly assume there must be dependence between the axes of any graph whether or not the data suggests a relation and whether or not it was a controlled experiment. Second, students have interesting issues using a legend to infer information about a third variable.

Specifically, we investigated hand orientations, amount of occlusion, and the effects of tablet position (on table or lap) and tilt angle (flat or tilted) on students preferred hand orientations when using a touch-screen tablet device. From 15 interviews with 5th7th grade students, we found five hand orientations, corresponding to a range from high to low occlusion. Tablet tilt angle seemed to considerably impact students preferred hand orientations. Based on these results, we suggest that encouraging students to work on tablets with a moderate tilt angle (30-45 degrees), rather than lying flat on a table, could significantly decrease occlusion and increase the effectiveness of touch-screen tablet devices for student learning.",Emily B.

In order to get the most out of the relatively expensive investment in IWBs, much of the attention has to be given to the pedagogic interactivity of the lessons. In a qualitative study, we investigated how our own lesson design, based on the principles of guided-inquiry and kinesthetic engagement of learners was accepted and implemented by high-school teachers and perceived by students. The feedback was then used to further inform our designs. Our study followed the design-based approach to research and used activity theory as a descriptive framework for analysis.The topics of the designed lessons were Kepler's laws in one case and refraction and total internal reflection in the other.",Bor Gregorcic,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5710,University of Ljubljana,"Eugenia Etkina, Rutgers University

5849,Contributed Poster Presentation,Developing and Assessing Scientific Reasoning in Introductory Physics Lab,"This paper describes the implementation of an introductory physics lab curriculum redesign at an open access, two-year college and reports on preliminary findings on student development of scientific reasoning.  We assessed scientific reasoning (SR) skills of (20) students in a redesigned physics lab.  Using a new assessment tool, Inquiry for Scientific Thinking and Reasoning, we quantified gains in SR sub skills.  Gains were demonstrated in the SR sub skills specifically targeted in the redesigned lab curriculum, including quantitative linear, correlation, control of variables (COV), integrated hypothesis, and hypothetical deductive reasoning.  Little or no gain was demonstrated in SR sub skills not explicitly addressed in the lab curriculum.  Assessed at a finer grain, basic COV sub skill gains were demonstrated.  These findings provide information on two-year college student SR skills and will inform future revisions of lab curriculum so that SR sub skills can be more effectively targeted.",Krista E.

Recently, a version of PET was developed for classes with larger enrollments. Both curricula were developed using research-based design principles, including an understanding of learning as a complex process that builds on prior knowledge, and is facilitated through behavioral norms and interactions with tools and peers. This paper describes the initial development and assessment of a fully online, asynchronous course based on PET. We describe the conversion from a face-to-face to online format and how the research-based design principles translated across instructional modes. We find particular challenges with fostering substantive interactions among students, which we attribute to the courses asynchronous nature rather than its online mode per se.

In a previous study, drawn from a national survey of college students in introductory English courses, five factors commonly proposed to positively impact female students' choice of a physical science career were tested using multivariate matching methods. The only factor found to have a positive effect was the explicit discussion of the underrepresentation of women in physics. In order to explore this further, a case study of the classes of one teacher reported to discuss the underrepresentation of women was conducted. Two classroom underrepresentation discussions were recorded, students and teacher were interviewed, and relevant student work was collected.  Analyzing the case study data using a figured worlds framework, we report on how discussing underrepresentation may create opportunities to increase the physics identities of female students.",Robynne M.

Knowing how to reason through a problem is also an important skill. In this paper, we study the effects of computer-based training on students reasoning on introductory physics problems. Participants solved four sets of conceptual problems, each of them containing three training problems with solutions followed by one near transfer problem and one far transfer problem. We analyzed students verbal answers to elucidate the reasoning resources that they activated to construct the different explanations to the problems. We found that the students changed their reasoning dramatically through the process as they were presented with solutions to training problems and later posed a transfer problem. Our results provide insights into students activation of their resources and the procedure they used to construct their reasoning in response to the training problems.",Xian Wu,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5720,Kansas State University,"Elise Agra, Kansas State University

Depending on whether or not the data was aligned with their prior belief, this could either increase or decrease their accuracy. We also found that students have prior beliefs even in a generic context: they have a predisposition to assume monotonic relationships. This appears to contribute to generally poorer performance for data sets with non-monotonic relationships. Finally, we found no significant correlation of students ability to correctly interpret the graphs and tables with course grades; however, there is some evidence that their ability is correlated with a simple test of statistical numeracy.",Abigail M.

Our findings suggest that students beliefs about the nature of knowledge are, indeed, related to students exhibition of these skills. Here we further explore this relationship through analysis of the coherence of students various epistemological beliefs and the effect of epistemology-focused classroom interventions on learning outcomes.

We will present how we have searched for an answer to this question by using the resources framework to analyze videotaped records of physics experts solving novel problems. By focusing on moments when physics experts reasoned towards a deeper understanding of the problem and dissecting their discourse during these moments, we identify resources that physics experts activate as they make progress through the problem solving process.

Indeed, performance is often poor on tasks that strongly elicit students' intuitive ideas.  Previously, we developed a paired-question methodology to disentangle reasoning approaches from conceptual understanding and used the dual process heuristic-analytic theory of reasoning to account for observed inconsistencies in student reasoning.  It has been argued that metacognition may foster the productive engagement of the analytic process during reasoning.  In this study, we examined the impact on student reasoning patterns of three metacognitive interventions that varied significantly in both focus and scaffolding.  Our findings suggest that, even for students with a robust conceptual understanding, incorrect intuitive reasoning persists and these interventions do not appear to engage the analytic process more productively.",Mila Kryjevskaia,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5816,"Department of Physics, North Dakota State University","MacKenzie R.

However, only of these four properties only two may be controlled independently.  This ambiguity of independent and dependent variables enables the same sort of mathematical flexibility (and confusion) that is present in thermodynamics.

To investigate these technologies, we have used data taken from the Sustainability and Gender in Engineering (SAGE) survey to note what kind of novel technologies students are using and how they impact a students scientific identity. 
In particular, we were able to determine the usage of these novel technologies from students who have taken high school Biology, Chemistry and Physics. From here we then examined how students who have used a particular technology perceived their ability to gain knowledge from multiple fields, design and experiment to answer a scientific question, and interpret experimental results.  Implications for future technology adoption and pedagogical reform will be discussed.",Jonathan Mahadeo,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5807,researcher,Zahra Hazari,2014
5665,Contributed Poster Presentation,Implementation and Adaption of SCALE-UP: A Case Study of Two Contrasting Universities,"Much time, money and effort has been spent developing innovative instructional strategies, yet widespread transformation of college teaching has yet to occur.  SCALE-UP (Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies) radically restructures the classroom environment and accompanying pedagogy to promote interactions.  Although SCALE-UP started in physics, it has spread to a large number of disciplines.  
This project deeply examines two secondary implementations of SCALE-UP-style at institutions that use SCALE-UP in multiple departments.  Key college faculty in these departments were interviewed to answer our research questions: (1) How did SCALE-UP come to be used at the institution?  How did SCALE-UP use spread within an institution? (2) What do faculty perceive as key features of SCALE-UP? To what extent are the essential features of SCALE-UP utilized?  How does this compare to other departments at the same institution? (3) What do college faculty perceive as the constraints, challenges and benefits of SCALE-UP?",Kathleen Foote,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5665,North Carolina State University,"Xaver Neumeyer, Charles Henderson- Western Michigan University

This reform was accomplished by implementing publisher-supplied hands-on lecture tutorials (LTs), which are short (15-30 minute) workbook activities that are done in class in small groups. Each LT is designed so that students uncover and confront common misconceptions about astronomical and physical concepts. The instructor, with the help of undergraduate learning assistants, acts as a facilitator during each LT exercise. Here we discuss the methods and challenges of implementation, and the impact on student learning by comparing exam performance in the LT sections to that in traditionally taught lecture sections.",Eric A.

In this study, we investigate the effect of visual cues and correctness feedback in conceptual physics problems containing a diagram with respect to the comprehension of physics concepts. Students enrolled in an introductory mechanics course were individually interviewed. Using think-aloud protocol, students worked through four sets of problems containing a diagram. Each problem set contained an initial problem, six isomorphic training problems, a near transfer problem, and a far transfer problem. The students provided verbal responses to the problems. Students in the cued condition saw visual cues on the training problems, and students in the feedback condition were told whether their responses were correct or incorrect.  We discuss the influence of both cueing and feedback on students reasoning in the training and transfer problems.",Elise Agra,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5716,Kansas State University,"Mitchell Burkett, Kansas State University

First, there are inconsistent definitions of what interdisciplinarity is. Second, definitions are limited to performance elements. In a break from this prior work, and building on promising preliminary work, we seek to define interdisciplinary affinity, a measure of students self reported interests and beliefs about interdisciplinarity. Based on hypothesized dimensions of interdisciplinarity, we draw on a large-scale national survey to build a useful measure of interdisciplinary affinity. Also, building on prior work, we investigate relationships between interdisciplinarity and physics and general STEM identities.

We have measured student learning of the core concepts in courses using these approaches with common exam questions and a standardized conceptual instrument. Preliminary data suggest a small but positive impact on students scores on topics related to quantum mechanical measurement in the classes taught using the discrete bases in the second approach. Preliminary data also suggest that using the discrete bases approach may shift student focus from computation to more sense making by providing concrete experimental evidence and simplifying the mathematical calculation processes.

We reviewed video of students solving a variety of physics problems in small groups through the lens of epistemic frames.   In this paper, we present a new frame, which we are calling ""Just Math"", that is similar to the worksheet frame, but is defined by brief, low-level, math-focused utterances between students.

We analyze Force Concept Inventory data collected before and after an introductory course for 13,422 students learning physics in high schools, two-year colleges, public universities and elite universities. When looking at individual answers, we argue that current gain metrics are only valid under the assumption that there are no losses. Across all students, we find mean losses of 30%, with little fluctuation from this value in all institutions except in elite universities (15%). This suggests that conceptual losses are important and that conceptual trajectories may be described as two-steps forward, one-step-backward. The instability of initially correct responses also provide more support for the resources model (positing conceptions as flexible and context-dependent) than for the misconception model (positing conceptions as deeply rooted and resistant to change). For conceptual assessments, we propose replacing current one-dimensional gain measures - that average over gains and losses- by a three-dimensional metric that reports students initial knowledge state and accounts both for gains and losses.",Nathaniel Lasry,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5705,John Abbott College,"Jonathan Guillemette

In the context of a think-aloud experimental activity involving optics and electronics, we document examples where students apply all of the key facets of modeling to their apparatus and measurement tools:  construction, prediction, interpretation of data, identification of model limitations, and revision.

As part of an introductory physics Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) offered by Georgia Institute of Technology, students submit video reports on force and motion labs. Peer evaluation of reports provides the primary method for evaluating student laboratory work. This paper describes the methods developed and used to guide students in evaluating each others' video lab reports when the course was offered in Summer 2013 and Fall 2013. Results of how students peer evaluation compares to experts evaluation will be presented.

5649,Contributed Poster Presentation,Performance of graduate students at identifying introductory students difficulties related to kinematics graphs,"The Test of Understanding Graphs in Kinematics (TUG-K) is a multiple choice test developed by Beichner in 1994 to assess students understanding of kinematics graphs. Many of the items on the TUG-K have strong distractor choices which correspond to students common difficulties with kinematics graphs. Instruction is unlikely to be effective if instructors do not know the common difficulties of introductory physics students and explicitly take them into account in their instructional design. We evaluate the performance of first year physics graduate students in identifying common introductory student difficulties related to kinematics graphs. In particular, for each item on the TUG-K, the graduate students were asked to identify which incorrect answer choice they thought would be most commonly selected by introductory physics students if they did not know the correct answer after instruction in relevant concepts. We used our graduate student data and the data from Beichners original paper for introductory physics students (which was collected from over 500 college and high-school students) to assess graduate student knowledge of introductory student difficulties. We find that, although the graduate students, on average, performed better than random guessing at identifying introductory student difficulties on the TUG-K, they did not identify many common difficulties that introductory students have with graphs in kinematics. In addition, we find that the ability of graduate students to identify the difficulties of introductory students is context dependent and that discussions among the graduate students improved their understanding of student difficulties related to kinematics graphs. Moreover, we find that the ability of American graduate students in identifying common student difficulties is comparable with that of foreign graduate students.",Alexandru Maries,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5649,University of Pittsburgh,Chandralekha Singh,2014

Teachers may want to employ KLAs to have students use their own bodies in learning to construct an appropriate level of understanding of physics entities, interactions and representations. However, few studies have investigated what characterizes learning opportunities afforded through KLAs. Using a/v recordings, we investigate characteristics of two different KLAs: A pulling and a circular movement activity. In both activities, students enact Newtonian objects. Here we characterize typical levels of affordances: (1) Students oscillate between playful behavior and focused reflective dialogue. (2) Students ways to enact models afford opportunities for a teacher to ask questions that foster and direct further student engagement. (3) Students make sense of the KLAs by linking their intra- and interpersonal experiences to formal physics knowledge.

[1, 2] In previous work we observed the likelihood of students correctly answering a kinematics question that is easily solved using common sense depended on preceding questions which aimed to prime intuitive reasoning or school-ish answer production. [3] That finding suggests the priming questions elicited different epistemological framings or expectations.  However, further analysis of the written survey responses and some think-aloud data call this explanation into question.  Our analysis identifies significant similarities in the epistemological expectations of correct and incorrect responders.  Hutchison and Elby noted that students who answered the kinematics question incorrectly had misinterpreted it, and argued this misinterpretation was a signal of their epistemological expectations.

While open-ended assessments scored with detailed rubrics provide useful information about student reasoning to researchers, end users need to score students' responses so that they may obtain meaningful feedback on their instruction. One solution that satisfies end users and researchers is a grading rubric that separates scoring student work and uncovering student difficulties.

Results indicate a strong interaction between scaffolding and student course grade. Specifically, students whose final class grade was above the median benefited significantly from the scaffolding, and students with grades below the median performed significantly worse with the scaffolding. We also searched for other knowledge and skill factors that may inform instruction to improve integral construction skills, including spatial reasoning (via the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test) and conceptual understanding of the integral.

5858,Contributed Poster Presentation,Students discussion: Does active learning facilitate responsiveness among peers?,"Responsive teaching has been found to have a positive effect on students' learning. Therefore, the aim to generate responsive environments in the student-instructor interaction is important. However, in what measure, the responsive environment provokes responsiveness among peers? We analyze a group discussion during an active learning electricity and magnetism class in a SCALE-UP-type classroom. Students engage in a highly responsive discussion among each other while trying to analyze the experimental results of a Gaussian gun. We observe that when students are open to explore different solutions to a problem, they try to understand their peers ideas and question them without being evaluative. We observe different student profiles that can facilitate a responsive environment, and others that can difficult it. Despite the differences, all of the students are able to engage in a responsive environment that could improve their learning process.",Carolina Alvarado,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5858,Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Genaro Zavala, Tecnologico de Monterrey",2014

Yet student reading may be ineffective if the students lack prior knowledge or metacognitive skills that they need to understand the textbook.   We asked: to what extent do students make use of prior knowledge and metacognitive skills when reading textbooks, and how does this knowledge vary between students?  We performed think-aloud interviews with both introductory-level and advanced physics students, using a textbook passage about pressure and density.  To the extent that students vary in their use of prior knowledge when reading, we would expect that students will learn differently from reading, and we test this hypothesis by correlating students learning gains with their use of prior knowledge.",Joshua Von Korff,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5839,"Georgia State University, Department of Physics and Astronomy","Merrin Oliver (Georgia State University, College of Education)

In this work we present a classification of the most frequent incorrect answers for each of the items of the TUV. We administered the test to 423 students who were completing the required sequence of introductory physics courses at a large private Mexican university. First we analyzed the overall performance of the students and cluster the items according to level of difficulty. We then developed the classification categorizing the items in four groups by type of difficulty: (1) graphical properties, (2) graphical procedures, (3) geometric calculation procedures, and (4) unit vector notation calculation procedures. These analyses provide a general description of the difficulties that university students have when applying vector concepts and could guide the design of new instructional material intended to increase students understanding.

Surveys were administered in an introductory algebra-based physics course (N = 68 completely matched). Positive correlations are observed between students overall TE scores and FCI pre and post scores (r = 0.4, p < 0.005). Correlations between TE scores and FCI normalized gains, however, are not statistically different from zero. These preliminary results suggest that students with a better understanding of force and motion concepts may more readily transfer understanding outside of the class, but out-of-school engagement may not be contributing to further learning gains. We conclude with a discussion of how responses to individual statements on the TE survey vary between students in the top and bottom quartiles based on FCI performance.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging may offer neurobiological insight into how these critical thinking skills are acquired. Prior work studying the neural correlates of problem-solving has focused within specific cognitive domains, e.g. mathematical calculation, verbal problem-solving, or visuospatial reasoning [1,2]. However, research identifying neural networks engaged during physics problem-solving is limited. We use the BrainMap database [3] to perform a series of neuroimaging meta-analyses across multiple distinct cognitive domains likely involved in physics problem-solving.

While Dirac delta functions are often introduced in order to simplify a problem mathematically, students often struggle to manipulate and interpret them.  To better understand student difficulties with the delta function at the upper-division level, we examined responses to traditional exam questions and conducted think-aloud interviews.  Our analysis was guided by an analytical framework that focuses on how students activate, construct, execute, and reflect on the Dirac delta function in physics.  Here, we focus on student difficulties using the delta function to express charge distributions in the context of junior-level electrostatics.  Challenges include: invoking the delta function spontaneously, constructing two- and three-dimensional delta functions, integrating delta functions in different coordinate systems, and recognizing that the delta function has units.

We apply this framework to the analysis of videos of university physics students instructed to describe their research to middle school children.

5660,Contributed Poster Presentation,Validation of the Japanese translation of the Force Concept Inventory and preliminary data analysis on the effects of class instruction and gender,"The Japanese translation of the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) was evaluated using the classical test theory indices for its quality as a concept inventory. Based on a hypothesis that Japanese students and American students share similar concepts of motion and force, the item difficulty indices of the pretests of American students and Japanese students attending mid-level universities in their respective countries were compared. The indices indicated that the Japanese translation is of high quality and comparable to the original FCI (correlation coefficient between the two groups = 0.87). Because the results indicated that the Japanese translation of the FCI is of high quality, the Japanese data on the pretest and posttest scores were then analyzed to measure the efficacy of class instruction. The data analysis showed that the posttest scores of Japanese students depended primarily on their pretest scores and secondarily on class instruction but not on gender.",Michi Ishimoto,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5660,Kochi University of Technology,,2014
5666,Contributed Poster Presentation,Vector Addition in Different Contexts,"The acquisition metaphor of learning is often used by teachers of physics: Students acquire a particular concept and transfer this concept to new contexts. For example, one might argue that students acquire the mathematical concept of vector addition and apply it in different physical contexts. In this study, 200 freshmen taking an introductory physics course were asked to calculate total force, total displacement and total momentum in simple contexts involving vector addition at right angles. Another similar group of 200 students were asked to calculate net force, net displacement, and net momentum.  The students asked to calculate the net quantity did significantly better than the students asked to calculate the total quantity. The students did significantly worse when adding momenta (as opposed to adding forces or displacements). These results are inconsistent with a basic acquisitiontransfer perspective of learning.

Examples of organizational elements are Concept Maps or flowcharts. But can this category of visual element lend insight to the analysis of the upper-level curriculum? The author is presently developing visual schema to encapsulate the content of the core courses.

5804,Contributed Poster Presentation,What Do Students Want? Small Group Instructional Diagnoses of STEM Faculty,"Small Group Instructional Diagnoses (SGIDs) are informal, mid-semester evaluations of courses, which the instructors request voluntarily. The facilitator of the SGID comes into a class while the instructor leaves and spends about 30 minutes with the students.

The first part of the SGID is done in small groups of students. The facilitator asks students to consider two questions, ""What are the strengths of this course?"" and ""What suggestions do you have to improve the course?"" After students work in groups for 10 minutes to compose lists of strengths and suggestions, the facilitator calls the class back together as a whole, records the most important strengths and suggestions, and has the class vote on them. These results are then shared privately with the instructor of the course.

Student comments from 45 courses taught by 27 STEM instructors have been collected and analyzed and will be presented. These have implications for instruction.",Jennifer Blue,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5804,Miami University,"Gregg Wentzell, Miami University

5696,Contributed Poster Presentation,Tiered iClicker Recitation Introductions and An Open-Ended Experiment,"Interactively engaging students can significantly help them understand key concepts [Hake 1998]. In PHYS 272 at Purdue University, we are experimenting with two methods of interactive engagement: introducing recitations with qualitative, tiered, iClicker questions and an open-ended laboratory where the students set up their own experiment.

A typical iClicker series has 3-5 questions and begins at a level where most students are confident in their answers. The series progresses to a point where most students have difficulty identifying the correct answer. Our goal is to demonstrate that these qualitative introductions coupled with quantitative collaborative work increases the students overall learning gain (measured by the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment). 

Separately, we are piloting an open-ended laboratory. The goal is to uncover the identity of 10 common circuit elements concealed in identical black boxes.

Scholars have noted that good video games are in fact carefully engineered learning machines, and that we in science education and the learning sciences have much to learn from game designers. One course of action is to use games to support or supplement instruction; another is to identify the fundamental principles and dynamics of game-based learning, and then investigate ways to incorporate those into non-game instruction.

5859,Symposium Poster,A Model of Video Game Learning Dynamics to Inform Instructional Design,"To facilitate the use of video game dynamics and learning principles in physics teaching, I offer a theoretical model that integrates ideas from a broad range of literature. The essence of game play is voluntary engagement with a succession of challenges, powered by four dynamical loops: exploratory learning, identity growth, intrinsic motivation through mastery, and adaptive game response. Game play is a co-construction of the game mechanics and player, and much of a game's power to engage and teach arises from five different types of human-computer ""meld"" that the player can experience. The model describes coarse- and fine-grained elements of the game mechanics and their interrelationships, and can be applied at four different levels: the micro-level game as a succession of interesting challenges, the macro-level game as a designed experience, and two meta-level games focused on extending or modifying game aspects and on social interactions surrounding it.",Ian D.

5889,Symposium Poster,"Animated Illustrations, Multicoding and Multimodality - Finding critical factors for an effective information processing","What are important settings for making learners benefit from illustrations and animated visuals?

One aspect is that the learning content as such has to be considered. Here we focus on phenomena that are not visible with naked eyes. Pictures and animations (in combination with text and formulas) are used to illustrate relevant physical characteristics that cannot be seen in reality. Examples and classifications will be shown.

Another important aspect is to assist information processing using multimedia to offer interactive visualizations and to provide possibilities also for combinations with acoustic information. Results from a study with 99 students who worked with a multimedia learning environment will be discussed. Distinction should be made between knowledge that was primarily based on pictorial information or on text based information. The best results provided animations with spoken explanatory text where pictorial imagination is important for understanding. This was significant for all students, but especially fruitful for the not so capable students. Concerning abstract, text based information students with higher abilities profited from written text, while students with lower abilities (median split) gained better results with spoken text. 

These results relate to material explaining how infrared motion detectors and infrared thermometers work, and how Planck's law and infrared radiation can be made more familiar.

The students' notebook and screencast solutions were examined for structural differences in their problem solving procedures and for correctness. These findings were combined with the examination of students' self-reports of behaviors and experiences while creating their solutions. Findings show that, within this classroom environment, students created more complete solutions to traditional physics problems and were more likely to get the correct answer when doing them on screencasts versus notebooks. Student surveys show that they felt more socially connected, increased authorship, and less frustration when creating solutions in their screencasts. Our findings suggest that the improvements in student work and increased social interactions were associated with the iPad-based screencasts acting as boundary objects, giving students the opportunities to creatively incorporate personally meaningful practices into their physics assignments.",Ben Van Dusen,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5886,University of Colorado Boulder,"Valerie Otero, University of Colorado Boulder",2014

We will present the ""expertise activity"" that we implement at the beginning of every new physics class. We ask students to identify a field of expertise outside of their academic life. Computer gaming is frequently identified by students. We ask them to describe a learning cycle that they can show the rest of the class to describe how to become an expert in gaming.

5887,Symposium Poster,Creating digital lab reports - effects on student's skill development,"Building up competence in planning, conducting, assessing and evaluating experiments and communicating their outcome are core competencies in most national curriculas. Grading a lab report gives only limited amount of information about how far this competencies have been developed in an individual. Tablet-PCs with their integrated cameras, internal and external measurement devices, and integrated video editing suites give the opportunity to create video lab reports that provide additional informations about student's experimental and presentation skills - while, possibly, leaving out other informations.

In a Design Based Research (DBR) Project targeted both at middle school and university students, we seek optimized processes to prepare for experimental labwork, building and testing factual knowledge, conduct and document experiments and store and grade electronic lab reports. Research methods include electronic pre/post testing with comparison groups, parttaking observation and guided interviews. Preliminary results show enhanced groupwork and a tendency to more theory-guided experimenting. Factual knowledge, on the other hand, needs still to enhanced e.g. by rigid pre-testing prior to the lab session.",Andr� Bresges,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5887,University of Cologne,,2014

The research is not only limited to those that function in practice, but integrate learning processes analysis. Empirical data analysis is carried out on three main research problems: 1) individual common sense perspective with which different phenomena are viewed and idea organization, in order to activate modeling perspective in phenomena interpretation, 2) the exploration of spontaneous reasoning and its evolution in relation to a series of problematic stimuli in specific situations, in order to formulate activity proposals, 3) recognizing the modalities for overcoming conceptual knots in the learning environment in order to reproduce these conditions. Three main aspects are studied: 1) object-models role in favoring the student's first interpretative steps, 2) ICT role in overcoming conceptual knots, 3) developing theoretical thought in an educational path concerning quantum mechanics.",Marisa Michelini,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5879,"University of Udine, Italy",,2014

To explore this effect in more detail, we conducted two double-blind, random-assignment experiments on students enrolled in introductory, algebra-based college physics.  In the first, students were randomly assigned to read one of two short essays (one focused on the underrepresentation of women in physics, the other reporting on AMO physics research led by a woman) followed by a uniform set of reflection questions.  In the second, another cohort of students was primed on their beliefs about gender differences in physics before undergoing the same treatment (one of two essays and reflection questions).

However, this research is not specific to physics and the question of when and how female students become engaged with learning physics in ways that may lead to their persistence remains largely unexplored. Drawing on data from more than a thousand undergraduate women in physics who completed a survey as part of the application process for the Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics, we identify the important role that high school physics plays in attracting female students to physics careers. Drawing on longitudinal interview data from nine female students, we further explore the ways in which high school physics experiences can have a lasting impact, especially as these experiences become more temporally distant.

5863,Symposium Poster,Game-ifying Scientific Concepts of Radioactivity,"Inquiry into Radioactivity simulators scaffold learning by placing students inside virtual worlds open to exploration and experimentation, with no overt agenda. Game design considerations have influenced the IiR simulators in several ways. They compress time and space, and their appearance achieves a cinematic visual style that welcomes non-science oriented students. Their game-like behaviors encourage curiosity-driven exploration: surprising phenomena (such as ionization or radiation emission) are first seen unexpectedly. Students must figure out what they have just seen, and groups often dive unasked into investigations to make sense of what they have discovered. Like computer games, the simulators display behaviors based on a vision of how the world might be rather than on the real behaviors observed in laboratories. They also deliberately exclude visual elements that might lead to alternate interpretations. Artistic license is used to help students visualize and connect phenomena on wildly different size and time scales.",Andy Johnson,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5863,Black Hills State University,Forest Johnson,2014

The use of pictorial task exercises was tested in a quasi-experimental study. 177 students (9th graders) participated in the study. The influence of working with different representations on knowledge acquisition and on knowledge transfer was examined. Knowledge acquisition, knowledge transfer, cognitive activities, and motivation were measured in the three groups that worked with: (a) written task exercises, (b) pictorial exercises and (c) mixed exercises.

Based on the properties of static textbooks the dynamic processes of magnetism were excluded in the present models. This fact is a problem in the understanding of magnetic phenomena and the compatibility of existing models with current scientific research in physics. Such a dynamic model of magnetism could be provided with the help of a multimedia learning environment (iBook) and usage of scientific methods for the visualization of magnetism (MOKE, MFM) on school level. To identify essential properties of such model, the knowledge of physics teachers about magnetism and interesting applications of magnetism for school a questionnaire has been developed and a teacher survey has been conducted.

5872,Symposium Poster,Peer Evaluation of Scientific Communication in a Blended Introductory Physics Course,"The Georgia Tech blended introductory calculus-based mechanics course emphasizes scientific communication as one of its learning goals, and to that end, we gave our students a series of five peer-evaluation assignments intended to develop their abilities to present and evaluate scientific arguments. Within these assignments, we also assessed students' evaluation abilities by comparing their evaluations to a set of expert evaluations. This poster summarizes our development efforts and describes the changes we observed in student evaluation behavior.",Scott S.

5877,Symposium Poster,Project laboratory for beginning physics majors: Think like a physicist from the start,"I will present 12 years of experience of leading ""Project laboratory"" course for first and second year physics majors. The main goal of the course is to develop students' science competences and skills in situations that are close to working conditions of physicists. This goal is achieved by giving the students an opportunity to work in small groups on open ended practical problems. The work takes 9 hours of class time (and more hours outside of class) and is spread over three weeks. Students design/build their own equipment, plan their own investigations and interpret and explain collected data. I will discuss the logistical and technical aspects of the course (equipment, examples of project tasks, etc.) present the examples of projects that students completed and share students' perceptions of learning in the course as expressed in their course evaluations.",Gorazd Planinsic,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5877,"University of Ljubljana, Slovenia",,2014
5880,Symposium Poster,Research-based Reform: Faculty as Change Agents in Multiple Departments,"The FIU Science Collaborative is a four-year project to reform undergraduate science education at Florida International University, driving institutional change through community building and faculty development across multiple departments. Each year, a cohort of faculty scholars undertakes transformation of their courses to incorporate and assess active learning. Scholars engage with reform in a variety of ways, from adoption of published research-based materials to creation of their own. We discuss examples and the bridges between faculty developers, faculty, and science education researchers that foster successful change.",Adrienne Traxler,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5880,Florida International University,,2014
5862,Symposium Poster,Reverse Game Play as an Introduction to Scientific Reasoning,"Helping students, especially non-science majors, develop an understanding of three aspects of science -- that scientific reasoning is not something that only certain people are capable of doing, that scientific theories are not ""grown-up"" hypotheses, and that all scientific findings are tentative -- is a difficult endeavor. Students have few, if any, experiences where they explicitly engage in formulating and testing hypotheses and building a model (theory) of a system. We have used reverse game play to put students into a situation where they have to carry out this program. The students are given the board, playing pieces, and several histories of two people playing an abstract strategy game. Their task, working in small groups, is to infer a model of the game, i.e., the starting positions, legal moves, how to win, etc. Preliminary investigations suggest that students have a tendency to generate vague and/or incomplete hypotheses through weak analysis.",David P.

5869,Symposium Poster,Student Engagement with Online Resources in a Blended Introductory Physics Course,"In the Georgia Tech blended introductory calculus-based mechanics course, pre-recorded lecture videos are used to introduce students to new materials outside of the classroom. Students also participate in online homework and forum discussions. This poster describes how students engage with different online elements in the course and how such understanding of student behaviors can provide insight into student learning.",Shih-Yin Lin,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5869,Georgia Institute of Technology,,2014
5890,Symposium Poster,"Student use of an interactive simulation in a large-lecture setting:  Analysis of students' simulation interactions, discussions, and perceptions","Interactive simulations are popular pedagogical tools with wide use in lecture demonstrations and recitation activities. Here, we investigate what can happen when students use interactive simulations as part of small-group activities in a large-lecture setting. In one general chemistry class, the eighty students (organized into self-selected small groups) were given 10 minutes to explore the PhET simulation Molecule Polarity without instructions on how to interact with the simulation. During this exploration time, we collected simulation interaction data (student mouse clicks), audio recordings, and clicker question responses from all student groups. We found that students explored the simulation fully without instructions, engaged in predominately on-topic conversations during exploration, and found the simulation easy to use and helpful for their learning. Further discourse and interaction analysis of a subset of on-topic student discussions uncovered rich examples of mechanistic reasoning supported by the simulation.",Emily B.

5882,Symposium Poster,Studio at CSM: Intro Physics and Beyond,"Studio and SCALE-UP (developed at RPI and NCSU respectively) have a long history in PER and at the Colorado School of Mines. CSM has been using Studio methods continuously since 1997, when the physics department implemented pilot sections of introductory calculus-based mechanics. Since then, Studio at CSM has expanded steadily. As of 2014, all of Physics I & II and Biology I are taught via Studio, along with pilot sections of Probability & Statistics. There are discussions in place to spread Studio to several other courses in the near term, including upper-division physics. In this talk, we'll briefly review the overall structure of Studio and some relevant performance data. The remainder will focus on the actual spread of Studio at CSM, highlighting a number of problems and how they were overcome, and reporting on the personal experiences of many of the instructors involved.",Patrick Kohl,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5882,Colorado School of Mines,,2014
5883,Symposium Poster,Studying the Spread of Research-based Instructional Strategies: Rich Case Study of SCALE-UP,"Much time, money, and effort has been spent developing innovative teaching pedagogies. But, the majority of college instruction in physics fields is inconsistent with research-based recommendations. This project investigates the dissemination and implementation of research-based instruction by using a web survey to understand the spread of SCALE-UP (Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies). Responses from 659 people indicate that SCALE-UP is used at over 250 institutions worldwide and has also spread to disciplines beyond physics. Information about SCALE-UP has traveled through both formal and informal channels. Secondary sites frequently modify the original SCALE-UP model, which may impact the success of the implementation. According to the Diffusion of Innovations theory, the developer may need to change the message to continue increasing the number of sites beyond early adopters.",Kathleen Foote,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5883,North Carolina State University,,2014
5866,Symposium Poster,The Impacts of Instructor and Student Gender on Student Performance in Introductory Modeling Instruction Courses,"This study considers the impact of instructor on the gender gap in students' scores on the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) in Modeling Instruction (MI) courses at Florida International University (FIU). Earlier work has shown that MI had increased FCI scores overall when compared to traditional lecture courses; however, the gap between male and female students' scores in the MI courses increased over the course of the semester. Student data was collected from 600 students at FIU, over 19 semesters, with 11 different instructors. General Linear Regression was used to determine the significance of the student gender and instructor factors in predicting a student's FCI score post-instruction and the fraction of variance explained by these factors. Effect sizes were then calculated from the difference in female students' scores from male students' scores and compared between instructors.",Daryl McPadden,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5866,Florida International University,Eric Brewe,2014
5867,Symposium Poster,The Long Term Impacts of Modeling Physics: The Performance of Men and Women in Follow-on Upper Level Physics Courses,"Active-learning approaches to teaching introductory physics have been found to improve student performance and learning gains in those introductory subjects.  This study goes further by investigating student performance in upper level physics courses after having previously taken Modeling Instruction introductory physics courses at Florida International University. Student performance data were analyzed for academic years 2010-2013 in upper level courses including Modern Physics, Mechanics, Electromagnetism, and Quantum Mechanics. We compare how students who took traditional or Modeling Instruction introductory courses perform in these subsequent courses.  We also look for differential effects between men and women who had these two types of introductory experiences.  The implications of this work for our understanding of the impacts of active-learning experiences will be discussed.",Idaykis Rodriguez,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5867,Florida International University,"Eric Brewe, Laird H.

5860,Symposium Poster,The intersection of learning design and game design: a robust strategy for creating an effective educational games,"To investigate the pedagogic potential of educational games, Georgetown University (GU) is implementing a rigorous instructional design process in which learning objectives are mapped to game actions/analytics and to research questions. The challenge for educational game design is to tap into games' pedagogical potential. Hoffman and Nadelson (2009) write, ""Our evidence suggested that games are unlikely to fulfill instructional expectations unless a direct relationship exists between the game and the learning context."" This game design process is being implemented at GU through a faculty gaming cohort and has been shown in a pilot project to produce a robust game design effective at achieving stated learning outcomes. We are gathering triangulated data sources to address: correlations between game play and learning outcomes, perceived helpfulness, and enjoyment and/or engagement when playing the game. This poster will detail the design process, its link to game theory, and preliminary findings.",Dedra Demaree,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5860,Oregon State University,"William Garr, Stacey Church",2014
5876,Symposium Poster,The process of an iterative design of a teaching learning sequence on electromagnetic induction,"This contribution proposes a iterative methodology for designing teaching-learning sequences. We will describe the didactical tools used in the design of the sequence which involve contributions from Physics Education research, STSE aspects and epistemological analysis of the contents of the school curriculum. In the presentation will be specified the methodology for the case of electromagnetic induction. This topic, in the usual teaching, is usually quickly analyzed, spending most of the time to solve problems in a more or less rote manner. However, Physics Education research has shown that the fundamental concepts of the electromagnetic induction theory are barely understood by students.",Kristina Zuza,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5876,"University of the Basque Country, Spain",,2014
5871,Symposium Poster,There is Learning in MOOCs - What Causes It?,"We have shown that there is learning in our MOOC both using pre/post testing and week to week ability analysis using Item Response Theory. The normalized gain is ~ 0.31, higher than traditional courses, but lower than most interactive courses. Students with lower initial skill, less educational attainment, or weak preparation in physics and math learn as much as other students. We observe correlations with time spent on different resources and also observe different learning habits of students showing relative improvement vs. those with relative decline over the course.",David Pritchard,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5871,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Kim Colvin, John Champaign, Qian Zhou, John Doucette, and Alwina Liu

5884,Symposium Poster,Transitioning Introductory Physics at UNC Chapel Hill,"At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill we have been teaching one reformed section of calculus-based introductory physics using the SCALE-UP (Student Centered Active Learning Environment for Upside-down Pedagogies) methodology since fall 2010. While the pilot study proved successful, we were unable to take the next step of ""scaling up"" to use this approach for all students. Beginning fall 2013 we adopted a Lecture/Studio methodology -- a hybrid of traditional and interactive engagement -- for all students. In this approach, students have one hour of lecture and two hours of studio twice per week. In this fashion we were able to offer large lecture sections for efficiency, but retain smaller, more intimate studios for hands-on, minds-on problem-solving and laboratory activities. How we got to where we are today, and the lessons learned along the way, will be discussed.",Alice Churukian,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5884,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,,2014
5873,Symposium Poster,Using the Tools of Online Analytics and Big Data in the On-�Campus Classroom,"Online environments produce large corpuses of Big Data which researchers can use to analyze user interaction. In MOOCs, students' use of videos, written text (forums, assignments, etc.), social interactions, quizzes, and exams are all instantly recorded and can be used to provide real-time feedback to instructors. On-�campus instructors using MOOC materials in their courses can also use these analytics tools to inform instruction in their own classrooms. At Georgia Tech, we have taken an in-�depth look at how students engage video lectures in a flipped/blended introductory physics course.

5875,Symposium Poster,Using�MOOCs�for�Professional�Training�of�In-�service�Teachers,"We report on two projects. First, the 8.MReV xMOOC is a course in mechanics, covering the same material as the MIT freshman physics course. Over its past iterations, over 25% of the students have been teachers.  A special discussion section allows teachers to discuss pedagogies for teaching each chapters material, and CEU credits are given. Second, we report on a recent short pilot of a hybrid cMOOC/xMOOC, called Maker Physics. It introduced participants to specific points of pedagogy, developed their comfort level with the EdX.org platform and encouraged the creation of physics content. Two working groups showed community style interactions during the creation of over 50 educational resources, although the pilot did not develop a course�-wide community. The course revealed a lack of shared premises and vocabulary between different areas of the educational community and began work on a shared discourse that could be the foundation of future collaborative models. Second, we found several places where both the technology and the pedagogy of the course needed smoother on-�ramps for students.",Dave Cormier,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5875,UPEI,Piotr�Mitros�(edX)�and�David�E.�Pritchard�(MIT),2014

However, students often struggle to develop these skills in higher dimensional settings.  Weve developed clear plastic surfaces with a dry-erase finish which let students discover key relationships between mathematical concepts in the multivariable setting.  Participants in this workshop will have an opportunity to play, draw, and make measurements on the surface manipulatives.  In addition to sharing how we use the materials to help students understand the geometry behind ideas like gradient, partial and directional derivatives, level curves, and various forms of integrals, we will spend significant time exploring and discussing how these surface manipulatives could be utilized in the physics classroom.",Aaron Wangberg,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2013/detail.cfm?ID=5682,Winona State University,"Brian Fisher, Pepperdine University
