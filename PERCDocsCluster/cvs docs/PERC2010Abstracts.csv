Nonetheless, participants in physics courses that involve energy are constantly saying what kinds of thing they think energy might be, both verbally and nonverbally.  The premise of an embodied-cognition theoretical perspective is that we understand the kinds of things that may exist in the world (ontology) in terms of sensory-motor experiences such as object permanence and movement.   We offer an example of an embodied learning activity about energy: that is, an activity in which we deliberately arrange for human bodies to symbolize entities in physical phenomena involving energy transfers and transformations.  Our observations suggest that this Energy Theater uniquely promotes engagement with deep conceptual questions about energy.",Rachel Scherr,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3510,Seattle Pacific University,"Sarah B.

Although this approach is efficient for getting answers, it is far from optimal for learning how conceptual knowledge is applied in the problem solving process. The goal of this study is to refine and evaluate an approach that encourages students to begin by writing a strategic analysis of a problem based on principles and procedures, and then to follow with a documented problem solution that exhibits, side-by-side, how concepts and equations go together in a solution.

We investigated whether formal spatial skills training can improve achievement in an undergraduate calculus-based mechanics course. Participants (28 female, 49 male) were randomly assigned to either a training group that completed six two-hour spatial training sessions, or a control group that did not. The training group consistently outperformed the control group on the courses exams\quizzes with an effect size of d = 0.38 for the examination composite score. However, the groups did not differ on a Force Concept Inventory (FCI) post-test. Nevertheless, common measures of spatial skills predicted students normalized FCI gains independent of FCI pre-test scores.

Yet, are all wrong answers equivalent? We conducted Latent Markov Chain Modeling (LMCM) analyses of all choices (right and wrong) on a subset of four FCI questions. LMCM assesses whether there are groups of students sharing similar patterns of responses. We infer that students sharing similar patterns also share similar reasoning. Our results show seven reasoning-groups. LMCM also computes probabilities of transition from one reasoning-group to another following instruction.

PhET simulations allow this process to happen dynamically so that students can continuously probe and explore the underlying science. For students to use simulations productively, understanding the science in the simulation must be challenging enough to maintain students interest, but not so challenging that students are overwhelmed. A key aspect of achieving a good balance is the complexity of the simulation for students. We have formulated an initial model to quantify complexity based on the number, range, and effects of controls and representations within a simulation. We account for students prior knowledge by adjusting the measured complexity depending on how students interpret the representations and conceptual connections within the simulation.

The curriculum emphasizes the distribution dependence on N, the number of binary trials, making extensive use of computational software with graphical displays, allowing N to span more than six orders of magnitude.  These activities provide excellent motivation for examining the increasing density of states toward the limit where integration of a continuous density function is required.  Thus, we have an ideal opportunity for students to engage the summation to integration transition of integral calculus.  The tutorial and a revised version were implemented during the past two years. Findings include improvement in recognition that the distributions become increasingly narrowed about the mean with increasing N.  However, significant confusion remains between microstates and macrostates and their roles in determining probability.

3526,Contributed Poster,Effects of a Prior Virtual Experience on Students Interpretations of Real Data,"Our previous work has shown that experimentation with virtual manipulatives supports students conceptual learning about simple machines differently than experimentation with physical manipulatives [1].  This difference could be due to the messiness of physical data from factors such as dissipative effects and measurement uncertainty. In this study, we ask whether the sequence of experimentation with physical and virtual manipulatives affects how students interpret the data from the physical experiment. Students enrolled in a conceptual-based physics laboratory performed both physical and virtual experiments to learn about pulleys and inclined planes.  Approximately half of the students performed the physical experiments before the virtual experiments, and the other half completed the virtual experiments first.  We find that using virtual manipulatives before physical manipulatives promotes an interpretation of the physical data that is more productive for conceptual learning.

3509,Contributed Poster,Enhancing problem-solving abilities by repeated training with scaffolded synthesis problems,"Based on learning by analogical encoding, we designed and implemented conceptually scaffolded synthesis problems to induce students to rely on fundamental concepts for problem-solving, an approach frequently employed by experts. These synthesis problems combine multiple topics that are broadly separated in the teaching timeline, militating against novice-like formula-based solutions. Moreover, each synthesis problem is sequenced with two preceding concept questions that share with it the same deep structure. After answering the concept questions and before solving the synthesis problem, students are explicitly reminded to seek the underlying connections. These concept questions, together with the explicit reminder, are used as guided scaffolding. 

A series of studies have been conducted. Specifically, this paper comparatively investigates the sustained effects of repeated training using scaffolded synthesis, un-scaffolded synthesis and textbook-like problems.

The data set consists of in-situ audio recordings of students working in groups during the weekly problem-solving session of their introductory algebra-based physics course.

Most students in a survey level physics course initially had only vague ideas about the structure of atoms and the roles of protons, neutrons, and electrons.  None invoked electrostatic attraction to explain why electrons stay near nuclei.  Developing new, productive ideas about atoms was nontrivial.

We created inquiry based activities that employ a new simulator (Atom Builder) that allows students to manipulate one atom at a time and observe its behavior.  Student knowledge of atomic structure and ionization improved dramatically but certain basic ideas remain elusive for many students.

A subset of 72 survey respondents were interviewed to better characterize how faculty interact with research-based instructional strategies (RBIS), use RBIS, and perceive their institutional contexts.  Drawing from 16 interviews with self-reported users of Peer Instruction [2], we describe what faculty mean when they identify themselves as users of Peer Instruction.  Meanings range from professors adopting the general philosophy of the instructional strategy (or what they believe to be the general philosophy) while inventing how it concretely applies in their classrooms to professors who use the instructional strategy as is, without significant modification.  We describe common modifications that are made to Peer Instruction and the associated prevalence of these modifications.

Our data indicates a statistically significant increase in the proportion of expert-like responses only at major transitions: those between school and university and the upper undergraduate-postgraduate transition. Both of these increases may be due to strong selection effects.

In this paper, I discuss two examples from one teacher, showing shifts in her practice from one moment to the next, within the same activity.  These shifts are characterized by different ways in which she attended to her students ideas.  Common accounts that attempt to explain teachers practice as the result of a unified set of beliefs, knowledge, and goals (e.g., teacher-type) cannot account for these two examples.  While these broad generalizations may be useful for studying broader patterns in large populations, they assume a consistency in teacher cognition that is not born out by the data.

A potential explanation for this persistent gap is that stereotype threat, the fear of confirming a stereotype about one-self, is inhibiting females performance.  Prior research has demonstrated that stereotype threat can be alleviated through the use of self-affirmation, a process of affirming ones overall self-worth and integrity [Cohen, et. al., Science 313, 1307].  We report the results of a randomized experiment testing the impact of a self-affirmation exercise on the gender gap in Physics 1.

We first look at student survey results for lower-level introductory students, finding a small, but significant correlation between performance on a mental rotations test and course achievement. In contrast, we find no such relationship for students enrolled in the honors introductory course. To understand the role that mental rotations plays in physics problem-solving, we examine how students use this tool on highly spatial physics problems in student interviews and find that mental rotation is neither necessary nor sufficient.

3575,Contributed Poster,How do the students perceive the reasons for their success in a modern physics course?,"In this study, our goal was to determine how students in modern physics course perceived their success and the reasons for the success. We view this through attribution theory. In this theory, Perception or inference of cause is called attribution and focuses on perceived causes of behavior (F�rsterling, 2001; Kelley & Michela, 1980; Weiner, 1974). In classroom settings, examination of students attributions about their success and failure helps to both identify students metacognition and to predict their future success in specific tasks. From a set of 27 interviews at the University of Maryland and the Middle East Technical University, we discuss the attributions of 6 students (3 from each venue) in terms of locus of control and stability. We selected the students to show the range of variation.  It was observed that how students make sense of success shapes the characteristics of their attributions.

For example, it has been shown that experts in art and chess spend more time than novices looking at relevant information.  Thus, it may be helpful to give novices more direct access to the way experts allocate their visual attention, for example using attentional cueing techniques. However, not much is known about how experts allocate their attention on physics problems. More specifically, we look at physics problems where the critical information needed to answer the problem is contained in a diagram. This study uses eye movements to investigate how the allocation of visual attention differs between experts and novices on these types of physics problems. We find that in problems that deal with energy, experts spend more time looking at thematically relevant areas of the figure than novices do.",Adrian Carmichael,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3524,"Department of Physics, Kansas State University","Adam Larson, Department of Psychology, Kansas State University

An ongoing research project[2] analyzes video data of groups of students who completed restructured computational activities with VPython[3] in a lab setting. These activities were designed to guide student attention on using fundamental principles to repair functional, but incomplete programs. Borrowing a framework from reading comprehension[4], tasks were developed to ask students to read the program code in these minimally working programs (MWPs) and create predictions of the 3D visualization produced by the program.

How do physicists and physics students make sense of these abstract equations? We suggest a theoretical approach to this question that marries ideas and methods of functional grammar and perceptual symbol systems. In short, we propose that mathematics, as used in physics, shares many identifiable elements with those of the grammar of human languages.  Moreover, these elements seem to play a similar cognitive/symbolic purpose to their equivalent linguistic structures. Consequently, although many mathematical expressions may validly describe a given physics situation, few are contextually appropriate. We present a study revealing how physics students interpret mathematical structure. For example, different forms of the same equation influence students models of the physical reality that the equation describes.

3507,Contributed Poster,Interpretation in Quantum Physics as Hidden Curriculum,"Prior research has demonstrated how the realist perspectives of classical physics students can translate into specific beliefs about quantum phenomena when taking an introductory modern physics course.  Student beliefs regarding the interpretation of quantum mechanics often vary by context, and are most often in alignment with instructional goals in topic areas where instructors are explicit in promoting a particular perspective.  Moreover, students are more likely to maintain realist perspectives on quantum mechanics when instructors are less explicit in addressing interpretive themes, thereby making such issues part of a hidden curriculum.  We discuss various approaches to addressing student perspectives and interpretive themes in a modern physics course, and explore the associated impacts on student thinking.",Charles Baily,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3507,"University of Colorado, Boulder","Noah D.

In the sequence, students begin with simple results from probability and develop a means for counting the states in a single Einstein solid.  The students then consider the thermal interaction of two solids, and observe that the classical equilibrium state corresponds to the most-probable distribution of energy between the two solids.  As part of the development of the tutorial sequence, we have developed several assessment questions to probe student understanding of various aspects of this system.

One area in which we have done this is with integration in the contexts of thermodynamic (P-V) work, which is process-dependent, and changes in internal energy, a (process-independent) state function. Physics majors answered paired questions, one in a physics context and the other an analogous integration question stripped of physical context, to investigate whether some of the difficulties identified as physics conceptual difficulties could have origins in the mathematics. We found similar difficulties in the work and one-dimensional integral questions. With state functions, student performance strongly favored the physics version. We also asked the math questions to calculus students, with similar results. Our findings have implications for mathematical roots of some physics conceptual difficulties and for student understanding of, and the overlooked sophistication of, canonical representations.",John R.

3530,Contributed Poster,Is explanation enough to assess student understanding?,"There is a strong emphasis in physics education research on the use of multiple representations to help students solve physics problems. Students who learned kinematics from the Physics Union Mathematics curriculum* answered a qualitative test question which required them to use multiple representations to explain their answer. Depending on the representation used for grading, different students showed understanding. When we looked at pairs of representations (motion diagram and graph), we found that students were often consistent but not necessarily correct. Based on the patterns in the data we argue that to fully assess student understanding we need to provide students with problems that require them to use at least three different representations to explain their answer.

During a recent study, DyKnow software was utilized to facilitate increased student interaction with the professor, to share group work, and to push notes to the students using laptops during class.  The authors then utilized data from student surveys, a focus group session, and student performance data in order to compare the impact of utilizing laptops on student performance measures, and on student perceptions of the course.

Normalized gains (g) have been useful in distinguishing active engagement and traditional instruction. Recently, concerns were raised about the normalized gain because it implicitly neglects retention (or equivalently ""losses""). That is to say, the Hake gain assumes no right answers become wrong after instruction. We analyze individual standardized gains (G) and losses (L) from data collected at Harvard University during the first five years that Peer Instruction was developed. Over the first five years, we find that gains increased and losses decreased. Furthermore, we find that the difference between g and G-L is negligible for students with higher normalized gains but sizable for students with lower normalized gains. The usefulness of looking into metrics of loss over the course of a semester warrants further research, particularly with different student populations.",Kelly Miller,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3615,McGill University,"Nathaniel Lasry, John Abbott College

We hope that students take what they have learned in their math classes and apply it to help represent and make sense of the physics.  To assess how well students are able to do this integration and application I have developed several simple concept tests on position and unit vectors in non-Cartesian coordinate systems as they are used in upper level E&M.  In this poster I describe these concept tests and present results that show students at different levels (pre-E&M course, post-E&M course, 1st year graduate students) and in different disciplines (physics, electrical engineering) have difficulty using non-Cartesian unit vectors appropriately.",Brant Hinrichs,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3504,"Drury University, Physics Department",,2010
3557,Contributed Poster,Student Understanding of the Correlation between Hands-on Activities and Computer Visualizations of NMR/MRI,"This study utilizes the implementation of research-based learning materials designed to teach students about the physics of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a concepts-based introductory-level physics course.  A progression of activities using hands-on experiments and computer visualizations leads students through the basics of magnetism and resonance, and finally toward a model of MRI.  Here we seek to describe how students understand the basics of resonance and then proceed to make correlations between the hands-on activities and visualizations.  Results show that students had fundamental difficulties with the concepts surrounding resonance, and that it appears to have led to a rudimentary understanding of the visualization and how the two tasks were correlated.  Based on student responses, we postulate what further scaffolding will be necessary for helping the students make more robust connections and a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomena associated with MRI.",Dyan McBride,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3557,Mercyhurst College,"Sytil Murphy and Dean Zollman

3649,Contributed Poster,Student responses to newly-implemented teaching methods in the advanced physics laboratory,"How do students in an advanced physics laboratory course respond when instructors incorporate different teaching methods? Physics education researchers have explored extensively how students respond (in the form of exhibited learning, attitudinal, and performance outcomes) to different instructional practices in introductory classrooms and laboratories. Studies of student responses to instruction in advanced laboratories, however, have primarily concentrated on the teaching of single physics experiments rather than broader pedagogical practices. In this poster, we describe three teaching methods faculty tried out for the first time in one advanced laboratory course, independent of specific physics experiments: oral assessments; multi-format written reports; and course wikis. We present results on student responses to the implementation of these methods. We engaged in qualitative analysis of multiple data sources, including student surveys, observations of laboratory activities, and student and faculty interviews. Investigating student responses to such instructional experimentation has implications for faculty aspiring to try new methods in advanced physics laboratory courses.",Julie Schell,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3649,Harvard University,"Jason Dowd, Harvard University

We administered a test to 409 students completing introductory physics courses at a private Mexican university. In the first part, based on the work of Van Deventer [1], we analyze the understanding of components of a vector. We used multiple choice questions asking for students reasoning to elaborate on the misconceptions and difficulties of graphical representation of the x- and y-component of a vector. In the rest of this work, we analyze the understanding of the dot and cross products. We designed opened-ended questions to investigate the difficulties on the calculation and the misconceptions in the interpretation of these two products.

3533,Contributed Poster,Students and Instructors Impressions of Ill-structured Capstone Projects in an Advanced Electronics Lab,"During the spring 2010 six students enrolled in an electronics advanced lab worked in pairs on ill-structured capstone projects. They designed electronic circuitry to automate experiments that were completed in a previous advanced physics lab. Some ill-structured features of these capstone projects included open-ended goals, limited guidance from the instructor and the possibility of multiple solution paths. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with both the students and the instructor of the class, before and after the students worked on these ill-structured capstone projects to gauge the participants expectations of the projects before they began and their views about these projects after they were completed. We report on the pre- and post-project impressions of the students and instructors regarding this ill-structured learning experience and the insights it provides us for future implementations of such projects.

3494,Contributed Poster,Students responses to different representations of a vector addition question,"Students use multiple methods to add vectors graphically [1], some of them leading to correct solutions, some of them not. We discuss students responses to four different representations of a single graphical vector addition question, designed to elicit different solution methods. These four questions have vectors arranged in either a head-to-tail or a tail-to-tail orientation and either with and without a grid. These questions were administered to several hundred students at two different universities. We present the prevalence of different methods in students responses on the four different types of questions. Furthermore, we describe the types of language they used as well as inconsistencies between students explanations and drawings.

Leaders provide the expertise needed to ensure that reforms promote student learning. The overarching goal of Leadership in Freshman Physics, a Math and Science Partnership (MSP), is to support a cadre of teachers-leaders who serve as advocates for excellence by developing their physics content and research-based pedagogical knowledge. In order to support teachers in developing effective leadership skills, we must first understand their views and prior experiences of leadership. We present results from the initial phase of our study in which we examined teacher self-reported leadership experiences and responses to a Teacher Leadership Inventory. Results highlight areas of inconsistency between teachers activities and what they view as leadership. Insights from our studies can be used to design differentiated professional development experiences to promote teacher leadership.

3540,Contributed Poster,Survey development for assessing learning identity in an ISLE classroom,"Innovative STEM curricula such as the ISLE curriculum (Etkina et al., 2007) are centered on active engagement in social learning processes as a means to achieve curricular goals. Classroom practices are highly interactive to facilitate students' development of authentic scientist abilities. To the students, these classroom practices often seem very different from their previous learning experiences in terms of behavioral expectations, attitude, and what it means to learn. Consequently, students must modify their identity as learners in addition to physics conceptual understanding in order to participate productively in this learning environment. Using a survey we developed, we want to assess their 1) expectations of student and teacher roles, 2) self efficacy towards skills supported in ISLE and 3) attitudes towards social learning as well as how these change as a result of their experience in this curriculum. We will discuss the development, validation and preliminary findings of the survey.",Sissi L. Li,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3540,Oregon State University,"Jennifer A.

Here we provide a case study of a third grade class that follows a responsive curriculum where the lesson is constructed around childrens ideas, and we show that a learning environment focused on the children's inquiries rather than on their arrival at those conceptual objectives can support the activation of those productive resources. That is, their teacher guided them to express themselves clearly, to draw on their own tangible experience, and to make sense. She did not drive them toward particular ideas about energy, but guided them in discovering the beginnings of the concept in what the children invented for themselves.

3520,Contributed Poster,The hidden curriculum in laboratory data analysis  development of a diagnostic test and initial results,"During the course of a Physics degree, our students spend a long time in the laboratory.  As well as learning how to do practical physics, we also expect them to pick up skills in processing, analysing and interpreting data.  These skills frequently fall into the hidden curriculum: they may not be explicitly taught (instead being absorbed as a side-effect of other activities) and are often not specifically assessed.  So do our students really attain a solid grasp of them?

We have developed and validated a 23-item MCQ diagnostic test on data handling skills in the physical sciences, incorporating such concepts as precision and accuracy, quantitative error analysis, graphical representations and lines of best fit.  The test instrument has been evaluated using a trial cohort of over 1200 students in 10 institutions across the UK and Ireland and has been found to perform satisfactorily on widely-used measures of reliability.

Our initial findings show that overall student attainment in these areas is surprisingly consistent across all institutions, disciplines and educational levels.  In particular, there seems to be no clear development of student ability after the initial year of instruction, with widespread stagnation of student skill levels in the later years of the degree.",Ross Galloway,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3520,University of Edinburgh,"Simon Bates, University of Edinburgh

The centerpiece of our environment is a collection of multi-level research-based problem sets organized by topic and cognitive complexity that are designed to help students learn physics problem solving. These sets are associated with learning modules that contain very short expositions of the content supplemented by integrated open-access videos, worked examples, simulations, and tutorials (some from ANDES).  Our pedagogical emphasis is Modeling Applied to Problem Solving pedagogy [1], but these materials are editable and rearrangeable to accommodate any pedagogy.  To assess students performance accurately with respect to a system-wide standard, we plan to implement Item Response Theory to assess students accurately. Together with other PER assessments and purposeful solicitation of student feedback, this will allow us to measure and improve the efficacy of various research-based materials, while getting insights into teaching and learning physics.

3513,Contributed Poster,"Usage of the Term Force, Reasoning Ability, and FCI Performance II","Do students with the greatest FCI gains and reasoning abilities change how they delineate force from colloquial equivalents any differently than other students?  230 students enrolled in first semester algebra based physics completed FCI pre- and post-tests, Lawsons Test of Scientific Reasoning Ability (TSR) and Mechanics Language Usage instrument (MLU) pre- and post-tests.  The MLU measured changes in usages of the term force via multiple choice and free response items.  Results of the quantitative data were consistent with prior research but also revealed that changes in performance on the MLU bear little correlation with FCI performance (gains, pre- or post-test) or TSR performance.  Presented in this poster are the exploratory findings of the subset of students within this study who demonstrated high FCI gains (>0.60) and elevated TSR scores (> 8/12) yet did not significantly change their usage of force as measured by the MLU.",Steven Maier,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3513,NWOSU,,2010
3493,Contributed Poster,Using analogy for learning Introductory Physics,Identifying the physics principles involved in solving problems is a critical step in problem solving. A major goal in physics education is to help students discern the deep similarities between problems based upon the physics principles so that they can transfer what they learned by solving one problem to solve another problem based upon the same principle. We conducted an investigation in which algebra and calculus-based introductory physics students were asked explicitly in the quiz to browse over and learn from a solved problem and then solve another problem that has different surface features but the same underlying physics principles. Different interventions were implemented for different groups to help students process through the physics principles involved deeply. Students performance on the quizzes after the intervention was analyzed and compared. We will present the findings.

This poster describes how 20 predictor variables correlate with faculty knowledge about and use of research-based instructional strategies (RBIS).  Profiles were developed for each of four faculty levels of knowledge about and use of RBIS.  Logistic regression analysis was used to identify five significant predictor variables.  High levels of knowledge and use of RBIS were associated with the following characteristics: attendee of the physics and astronomy new faculty workshop, attendee of at least one talk or workshop related to teaching in the last two years, satisfaction with meeting instructional goals, regular reader of one or more journals related to teaching, and being female. High research productivity and large class sizes were not found to be barriers to use of at least some RBIS.",Charles Henderson,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3542,Western Michigan University,"Melissa H.

We administered a test to 512 students completing introductory physics courses at a private Mexican university. In the first part, we analyze student� responses in three isomorphic problems: displacements, forces, and no physical context. Students were asked to draw two vectors and the vector sum. We analyzed students procedures detecting the difficulties when drawing the vector addition and proved that the context matters not only compared to the context-free case but also, between the contexts. In the second part, we analyze students� responses with three different arrangements of the sum of two vectors: tail-to-tail, head-to-tail and separated vectors.

3633,Contributed Poster,Which instrument to critically select (among so many),"A plethora of measurement instruments in science and education are used to measure even the same construct in the cognitive or affective domains of learners. The dilemma occurs when the investigator is faced with limited resources, or is sensible to learners' fatigue, cognitive load or attrition. This leads the investigator to choose one instrument or another to measure the construct of interest. This paper presents the reasons for choosing a specific instrument among many competing ones. Based on another paper submitted to PERC 2010, the following reasons of selection are compared: (a) number of items in each instrument, (b) number of dimensions (or factors) each instrument is composed of, (c) targeted population, (d) internal consistency (e) reliability, and (f) popularity of use. The paper provides an examples of comparing four different instruments that aim at measuring learners epistemological beliefs, and shows how one instrument is critically selected.",Ahmed Ibrahim,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3633,McGill University,,2010
3617,Contributed Poster,Who becomes a physics major? The role of students' beliefs about physics and learning physics,"Efforts to address the hidden curriculum within introductory physics courses aim  in part  to move students towards more expert-like beliefs about physics and learning physics. In this poster, we examine the correlation between students beliefs upon entering college and their likelihood to continue on to become a physics major. Since 2004, we have collected CLASS survey and self-reported level-of-interest responses from students in the first-term, introductory calculus-based physics course (N>2500). Here, we conduct a retrospective analysis of students incoming CLASS scores and level of interest, comparing those students who go on to become physics majors with those who do not. We find the incoming CLASS scores and reported interest of these future physics majors to be significantly higher than the class average, indicating that these students enter their first college course already having quite expert-like beliefs. The comparative differences are much smaller for grades, SAT score, and university predicted-GPA.",Katherine Perkins,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3617,University of Colorado,"Mindy Gratny, University of Colorado",2010
3541,Contributed Poster,Why is it difficult to lead conceptual change by using a count-intuitive demonstration?: An example from the brachistochrone problem,"A considerable number of researchers argue that cognitive conflict is a necessary condition of the type of learning that is described as conceptual change. In light of this idea, many of teaching strategies use a count-intuitive demonstration as a means of facilitating a change in students conceptions. However, other researchers argue that cognitive conflict strategies do not consistently lead to conceptual change. Even when students ideas are confronted with contradictory information through instruction, frequently such contradictory information does not result in meaningful conceptual change for a learner. In order to understand this controversy in more detail, we set about exploring how students response to a count-intuitive demonstration. Participants in this study were 96 secondary school students (9th grade) from Seoul, S. Korea. We investigated students preconceptions on the brachistochrone problem by administrating a written test. After the exam, we presented a demonstration that might contradict the current ideas of students who had answered the written test problem incorrectly. We then investigated students responses to the count-intuitive demonstration by using a Cognitive Conflict Level Test (CCLT). Results show that there were diverse responses to the demonstration, especially, superficial theory change was the major response. We discuss how those responses can make the difficulties in the process of conceptual change.",Gyoungho Lee,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3541,Seoul National University,"Taejin Byun,

3681,Invited Talk,Development of functional understanding in physics: Promoting ability to reason,"A functional understanding of a concept in physics connotes the ability to interpret and apply it appropriately. The need to help students learn how to do the requisite reasoning is often ignored in introductory physics, a neglect that often continues in upper division courses. The emphasis in most recent research at the university level has been on the qualitative understanding of concepts, models of student thinking, and problem solving ability. These are all important, but there is also a need to conduct research to guide the development of instructional materials that promote the development of basic scientific reasoning skills (e.g., interpretation of proportions, construction of proper analogies, control of variables, use of limiting arguments, deductive and inductive logic). Examples will illustrate how the study of physics can cultivate ability in scientific reasoning.

3569,Invited Talk,Introducing students to the culture of physics: explicating elements of the hidden curriculum,"When we teach physics to prospective scientists and engineers we are teaching more than the facts of physics  more than the methods and concepts of physics.  We are introducing them to a complex culture  a mode of thinking and the cultural code of behavior of a community of practicing scientists.  This culture has components that are often part of our hidden curriculum: epistemology  how we decide that we know something; ontology  how we parse the observable world into categories, objects, and concepts; and discourse  how we hold a conversation in order to generate new knowledge and understanding.  In order to understand these often-tacit components of our teaching, we need an understanding of how students minds work, how they perceive the activities of science, and how we perceive those activities.  To teach our hidden curriculum we must pay attention to students intuition and perception of physics, not just to their reasoning.",Edward F.

But if we stop briefly while grading an exam, preparing a lab, or running a review session and ask ourselves what students will remember 20 years form now, the question and its answer might change completely what we do every day. Our PER group has tried to answer this question and as a result is changing our approach to teaching introductory physics. We still want students to understand electromagnetic induction and thin lenses; but a larger goal is to empower them with the understanding of reasoning processes that help them make independent decisions and solve complex problems in their future lives.

3682,Invited Talk,"Toward meaning and scientific thinking in the traditional freshman laboratory: Opening the ""idea space""","The physics freshman laboratory curriculum would appear to be a natural place for students to participate in activities related to critical thinking. However, several elements of the more traditional curriculum, such as an instruction driven recipe-like approach in order to reproduce well-known results, conspire together to send a message that is at odds with broad scientific thinking. It is postulated that this type of formulation of laboratory activities causes a closing of the student ""idea space"". For meaningful reflection and critique to be a natural part of the learning activities it is necessary to open the idea space by choosing suitable ways of framing the activities in terms of the parameters that control the idea space. In the talk we look at three such parameters that appear to control the idea space: metaphors, audience and language usage.",Saalih Allie,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3682,"University of Cape Town, South Africa",,2010
3679,Invited Talk,Uncovering the hidden decisions that shape curriculum,"Developing explanatory models is a central practice to scientific inquiry. When students create and test explanatory models for scientific phenomenon, they develop content knowledge, knowledge of the nature of science, and creative thinking skills. Unfortunately, such instruction rarely occurs in K-12 science. This is, in part, because teachers do not have the opportunity to develop sophisticated understandings of the process of modeling, but also because teaching in this way requires teachers to make real-time instructional decisions that are responsive to students? ideas. This is challenging for new teachers, especially because this decision process is often invisible. In this talk, I will highlight the importance of providing opportunities for sophisticated science thinking for our youngest learners and consider how uncovering the decisions that shape physics courses for teachers may benefit their future students.",Danielle Harlow,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3679,"University of California, Santa Barbara",,2010
3628,Round Table Discussion,Epistemology in the hidden curriculum: Why should anyone care?,"The evidence is unequivocal: physics courses influence students epistemological beliefs whether we intend this or not.  Unfortunately the influence is often negative in that students seem to move further away from the epistemic perspective of a physicist. We suggest that the physics curriculum, materials, learning activities, learning environment and assessments all send epistemic messages to our students. These are messages about the nature of physics and physics learning, and how physicists have come to know what they know. Such tacit messages form part of the hidden curriculum (Lin, 1982).  Science instructors often lament that science is too often presented as a rhetoric of conclusions (Schwab, 1962)  but why should we care? Why should instructors concern themselves about anything beyond students understanding of physics content and ability to solve problems?

Data will be collected in several post-secondary institutions. Interviews will be conducted by research assistants under the supervision of professors on the team.

When students work alone, they are deprived of one of the necessary components for development, namely social interactions in an intellectually challenging situation.  In these evidence rich settings of students constructing and mutually negotiating for meaning of physical theory for a phenomenon, we have a window on the development of physical theory in their minds.

In particular, we present the material as narrated animations under student control.  Offloading the presentation of basic content to these multimedia presentations has, in turn, allowed the lectures to focus on active learning and concept refinement.

We advocate for a perspective of respect towards TAs when conducting TA research and instruction. Such a perspective sees TAs as partners in the endeavor of educating students and seeks productive seeds in their beliefs. A resource framework supports a respectful perspective by focusing the attention of researchers and instructors of TAs on what resources TA already have available to them. It also discourages a view of novice TAs that primarily focuses on their deficiencies as reform instructors.

The physics majors introduction to Quantum Mechanics is the Quantum Measurements and Spin Paradigm (Spins).  I am heavily influenced by the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) curriculum that mirrors the goals of these upper-division courses in having students engage in authentic practices of physics. Having spent two years implementing ISLE in the lower-division courses, when I taught the Spins course I modified some activities to align with ISLE methodology.

We use social network analysis as one way to establish differences the participation of students in lecture sections and students in Modeling Instruction, a curriculum that uses interactive engagement. One primary difference in the way students participate in the two instructional practices is that students in Modeling Instruction classes form learning communities and students in lecture classes remain isolated. Students in Modeling Instruction sections report 10x greater numbers of ties between students than those in lecture sections, forming richer and more deeply connected networks.

Moses, provides access to understanding of algebra for middle school students and their teachers by guiding them to participate actively and communally in the construction of regimented symbolic systems.  We have extended this work by applying it to the professional development of science teachers (K-12) in energy.  As we apply the Algebra Project method, the focus of instruction shifts from the learning of specific concepts within the broad theme of energy to the gradual regimentation of the interplay between learners' observation, thinking, graphic representation, and communication.  This approach is suitable for teaching energy, which by its transcendence can seem to defy a linear instructional sequence.  The learning of specific energy content thus becomes more learner-directed and unpredictable, though at no apparent cost to its extent.

These interviews helped identify the common difficulties students encountered when solving physics problems posed in multiple representations as well as the hints that help students overcome those difficulties.  We found that most representational difficulties arise due to the lack of students ability to associate physics knowledge with corresponding mathematical knowledge.  Based on those findings, we developed, tested and refined a set of problem-solving exercises to help students learn to solve problems in graphical and equational representations.  We present our findings on students common difficulties with graphical and equational representations, the problem-solving exercises and their impact on students problem solving abilities.

3654,Targeted Poster,Helping students learn effective problem solving strategies by reflection with peers,"We describe a study in which introductory physics students engage in reflection with peers about problem solving. The recitations for an introductory physics course with 200 students were broken into the ""Peer Reflection"" (PR) group and the traditional group. Each week in recitation, students in the PR group reflected in small teams on selected problems from the homework and discussed why solutions of some students employed better problem solving strategies than others. The graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants (TAs) in the PR group recitations provided guidance and coaching to help students learn effective problem solving heuristics.  In the recitations for the traditional group, students had the opportunity to ask the graduate TA questions about the homework before they took a weekly quiz. The traditional group recitation quiz questions were similar to the homework questions selected for ``peer reflection"" in the PR group recitations.

As one measure of the impact of this intervention, we investigated how likely students were to draw diagrams to help with problem solving.
On the final exam with only multiple-choice questions, the PR group drew diagrams on more problems than the traditional group, even when there was no external reward for doing so. Since there was no partial credit for drawing the diagrams on the scratch books, students did not draw diagrams simply to get credit for the effort shown and must value the use of diagrams for solving problems if they drew them.

We also find that, regardless of whether the students belonged to the traditional or PR groups, those who drew more diagrams for the multiple-choice questions outperformed those who did not draw them.",Andrew Mason,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3654,University of Pittsburgh,"Chandralekha Singh

3657,Targeted Poster,Hidden benefits of engaging students in experimental design and invention of physics concepts,"Innovation and efficiency  the dilemma between these two aspects of learning is at the heart of our perception of what good teaching or learning are. We wish to streamline, speed up, shorten, and simplify both student learning and classroom assessment. If some curriculum ""takes too long to get to X,"" we are unlikely to adopt it. Despite the research on the benefits of engaging students in innovation, there is very little room left for student innovation (including experimental design) in the current educational system, which is primarily based on efficiency.

In this poster we challenge conventional wisdom that prefers efficiency. We show evidence that design and innovation that take a lot of time not only engage students in constant sense-making and prepare them to learn on their own later but, most importantly, help them develop one of the crucial skills that they will need in the future: intellectual perseverance.",E.

3674,Targeted Poster,How Students Structure Argument through the Interplay of Claims Made about Phenomena and Instruction,"Understanding how specific learning environments influence student participation in science classrooms is fundamentally important to physics education research and its efforts at educational reform. Over the past few decades, science education researchers have shown an increased interest in the role that scientific argumentation plays in school science, both as an aspect of authentic scientific practice and as an instructional approach to learning. We report on an ongoing investigation to understand how curricular structures common to physics education shape student participation in scientific inquiry, using student argumentation as a window into classroom participation. In this paper, we provide a brief analysis of students' collaborative arguments during an inquiry lesson on the nature of light in order to illustrate how students' arguments about the physical phenomena interact with the specific claims students make about the lesson, and discuss the impact this has on students' opportunities to participate and learn.

3638,Targeted Poster,Inventing-with-Contrasting-Cases: An instructional method that improves students' uptake of big ideas,"Inventing-with-Contrasting-Cases (ICC) is an instructional method that helps students perceive critical deep structures underlying problems.  This poster delineates three essential ingredients of ICC.  First, the instruction must focus on a deep structure or ""big idea"" that runs through many areas of physics.  In the examples of ICC we provide, ratio is the big idea.  An understanding of proportional reasoning is necessary for learning many physical concepts such as density, speed, and acceleration.  A second element of ICC is that students ""invent"" or generate a single representation that captures the big idea.  This representation could take the form of a formula, theory, or graph.  Third, optimal contrasting cases support invention.  Contrasting cases are examples of phenomena that are designed to highlight critical deep features through contrast.  These three design points are illustrated with instructional and empirical examples in the domain of proportional reasoning.",Catherine C.

3637,Targeted Poster,Invention of Physical Quantities as an Underpinning for Proportional Reasoning,"Mathematical reasoning skills are fundamental tools for understanding physics, and proportional reasoning is perhaps the most familiar skill.  Physicists reason this way in the context of nearly every physical quantity. It is rudimentary, yet we know our students often leave our courses without having mastered this important skill. In an ongoing collaboration between Rutgers University, Western Washington University and New Mexico State University we have developed curricular materials and methods for using invention as a preparation for instruction, building the foundation for proportional reasoning in the context of physics. This poster describes ""invention sequences"" that are based on inventing-with-contrasting-cases piloted at Stanford University School of Education*. We present the materials and how their existence has affected the emphasis of the teachers and students that use them.

They provide memorable classroom experiences and allow students to embody their conceptual physics knowledge. We will present kinesthetic activities that are used in junior level physics courses and lead a discussion about their implementation and affordances for student learning.

Modeling Instruction developed to explicitly uncover the underlying physical models hidden in a standard physics curriculum. Associated with this curricular reform is a pedagogical reform that enacts the epistemological belief system that Modeling is the central process in science.  As with all belief systems, Modeling embeds features in the instructional practice that are 'hidden'.  In this poster, we consider the implications of exposing elements from the hidden curriculum by focusing through Modeling Instruction, and also what has been hidden by implementing a curriculum and pedagogy with a modeling epistemological foundation.",Eric Brewe,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3658,Florida International University,"Laird H.

3673,Targeted Poster,"Opportunities for Learning: Hybrid Spaces, Vygotsky, and the Endorsed Narrative","This study seeks to answer the question, ""How does learning happen?"" The context was a Physics and Everyday Thinking course, a highly interactive physics curriculum in which students collect and analyze data as a means by which to establish scientifically accepted ideas. Two focus students were video taped throughout a unit on magnetism as they transitioned through 7 different representations of their model of magnetism. Evidence also shows that their discourse and model-building practices developed greatly throughout the unit. The findings of this study are framed in terms of Sfard and Laive's (2005) notion of the objectification of discourse as a definition of learning.  I will demonstrate that the learning of physics that was observed in this study resulted from the students objectifying their discourse away from the self and its communication with other people and toward the self in relation to the human-independent world of magnetic phenomena. Evidence is used to demonstrate how elements of the curriculum, classroom norms, and the discourse itself were instrumental in the learning that took place for these students.",Valerie Otero,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3673,University of Colorado at Boulder,,2010
3646,Targeted Poster,Physics Learning as the Objectification of Discourse,"In research on disciplinary knowledge, language is often treated as a communication medium rather than as a legitimate part of cognition. Both language and concepts are involved in the learning process, yet they are almost impossible to analytically distinguish from one another. I tackle this problem head-on using the notion of objectification of discourse to define the development of conceptual understanding. Objectification of discourse is the process that begins as an interpersonal affair and as a result, turns into a matter of one's relation with the human-independent world. This Vygotskian perspective integrates elements of a behaviorist perspective and can shed light on how learners come to understand, and participate in, the Discourse of physics. Using a video snippet from a Physics and Everyday Thinking class, I will illustrate early phases of this learning process and demonstrate the interpersonal focus of students' discourse and highlight how this leads to scientific, mechanistic reasoning.",Valerie K.

As an activity in a first semester, upper division electricity and magnetism course, students work in groups during class to develop an integral expression for the magnetic field in all space due to a ring of charge rotating about its axis. This is a direct but complex application of the Biot-Savart Law, requiring students to break the problem into pieces and employ a number of physics concepts. The problem also presents an opportunity for students to draw on analogous earlier work, including finding the electrostatic potential and field due to a ring of charge.

Over the past two years we have utilized a number of techniques to understand how to facilitate activities that promote productive discussion within the large lecture classroom.

3659,Targeted Poster,Street-fighting mathematics: Teaching mathematical courage,"Mathematics, the queen of the sciences, rules its domains with a strict, deductive hand---at least, that is what our students get taught explicitly.  Mathematics courses, for example, come packed with definitions, lemmas, and theorems.  At best, students learn to follow proofs made by others.  Seeing mathematics as a field where any mistake is fatal, students cannot imagine using mathematics to express or discover patterns in the world.  The explicit focus on rigor teaches rigor mortis. 

After years lamenting this problem, I created ""Street-fighting mathematics"", an applied-mathematics course at MIT whose explicit lesson is courage.  It teaches six reasoning modes useful across science and engineering: dimensions, extreme cases, lumping, pictorial reasoning, successive approximation, and reasoning by analogy.  I will illustrate each reasoning mode with examples---and, as a pacifist, encourage you to use these tools, and others that you find, to produce bold mathematical street fighters.",Sanjoy Mahajan,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3659,MIT and Olin College,,2010

It involves inductees (students) becoming increasingly involved in a specialized discourse that has fixed rules, but whose rules are seldom made explicit within the physics community that uses them.  I will then discuss one method of making these ""discourse rules"" of physics explicit for students by using formative assessment rubrics.

These transformed classes are moderate in size (~20-60 students), and largely follow traditional local norms of syllabus and content coverage. However, our faculty have recently articulated broader learning goals (e.g developing math-physics connections) expected for physics majors in these courses. The design and use of concept tests is aligned with these goals, and has altered the dynamic of our classes. Coupled with other course transformations, we find measurable improvement in student performance on targeted conceptual post-instruments. Here, we discuss classroom logistics of upper-division clickers, design of clicker questions, aspects of student engagement facilitated by concept-tests, and measures of and challenges to sustainability of this activity.

The ""cells"" of this talk and action are events on the order of one second long.  The meaning of such events is made evident in interactional sequences on the order of minutes.  Our particular analytic interest is in the ways in which our sensorimotor systems shape, generate, display, and limit the kinds of things we think about, and in how material artifacts shape the substantive and interactional aspects of students' activity.  In this view, students that just sit still and talk to each other aren't doing much.  We analyze a sequence of medium richness, in which the construction of a whiteboard structures students' thinking about energy.  In this sequence of a few minutes, the embodiment of cognition is apparent in what the participants say, but social constraints limit their use of their bodies.",Rachel Scherr,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2010/detail.cfm?ID=3648,University of Maryland,"Hunter Close

3656,Targeted Poster,Using analogy to help students learn Introductory Physics,Identifying the physics principles involved in solving problems is a critical step in problem solving. A major goal in physics education is to help students discern the deep similarities between problems based upon the physics principles so that they can transfer what they learned by solving one problem to solve another problem based upon the same principle. We conducted an investigation in which more than 800 algebra and calculus-based introductory physics students were asked explicitly in the quizzes to browse over and learn from a solved problem and then solve another problem that has different surface features but the same underlying physics principles. Different interventions were implemented for different groups to help students process through the physics principles involved deeply.

3640,Targeted Poster,What do students think about when they think about proportions?,"Physicists reason about proportions in a variety of contexts without conscious effort.  Students, on the other hand, tend to reason about ratio operations based solely on memorized algorithms.  They struggle to match the appropriate algorithm to the situation encountered.  If asked to justify or explain an operation, they not only are unable to do so, but often do not even understand what is being asked.  Further, students seldom reason consistently from context to context the way a physicist does. In light of these findings, describing the classroom work of students as ""proportional reasoning"" may be a misnomer.  One strategy that can be used across contexts to justify mathematical operations and check them is ""package reasoning,"" described by Arons, McDermott, and others.  At Western Washington University, we are investigating how students engage with package reasoning, including what productive footholds might be available to them, and what features present particular difficulty.

3647,Targeted Poster,Who says what and when: How rules of discourse impact learning interactions,"When multiple people engage in conversational interaction, either casually or with an well-defined goal, that interaction is governed by a set of tacit rules that give rise to certain regularities in the conversation. There is a rich tradition of research that examines the moment-to-moment dynamics of naturally occurring talk-in-interaction - such as everyday conversation, tutoring, interviewing, and large group classroom discourse - to identify these rules of discourse. Knowing these rules for different interactions facilitates comparison across forms of talk and identification of continuities between them. In this work I use techniques from Conversation Analysis to understand the rules of discourse that govern the interaction of two students as they generate an explanation for magnetic attraction. Doing so allows me to examine which other conversational forms the interaction resembles, and thus speculate about which patterns of participation may either support or inhibit their learning in this interaction.",Rosemary S.

How can we help?,"Despite a significant emphasis on ratio strategies in precollege mathematics, many students have difficulty reasoning about ratio quantities in college physics. Research shows that students who struggle with simple questions that involve proportional reasoning tend to be less successful in introductory physics classes1. This should hardly be surprising: the introductory course makes extensive use of proportional relationships between physical quantities in increasingly abstract contexts, and we teach assuming that students understand the algebraic representations and the proportionalities they imply.

This session brings together current work on student thinking and learning about proportions. Well explore the mismatch between our expectations and how well students actually reason about proportions, some productive and unproductive ways students reason about ratio quantities in physics, an instructional method that promotes proportional reasoning, and its implementation in college physics courses.
