There are invaluable studies in literature based on both of these paradigms, and all provide us with important information about how students conceptualize nature. However, both paradigms have advantages as well as limitations compared to one another. In this study, a need for a cross paradigm to diagnose student conceptions will be discussed, and an example of a cross paradigm method to diagnose conceptions will be proposed.",Derya Kaltakci,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2712,"Physics Education Group, Department of Physics Box:351560","Ali Eryilmaz

Light and Optics Case,"Several studies in physics and science education research have revealed that students have difficulty in understanding some introductory light and optics concepts. Nowadays, more emphasis is given to using appropriate methodologies to eliminate these difficulties, and to understanding the nature of acquisition of scientific conceptions fully. However, in addition to identification of these difficulties in students minds, the possible sources of these difficulties should be determined and eliminated. Students experiences, textbooks, language used, teachers can be listed among several possible sources of students unscientific conceptions in physics. In the present study examples of these possible sources will be provided with related unscientific conception from light and optics.",Derya Kaltakci,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2710,"Physics Education Group, Department of Physics Box 351560","Ali Eryilmaz

Since these instructors spend the most time directly interacting with introductory physics students, their beliefs regarding the nature of instruction may play a critical role in the success of reformed teaching methods. In this study, we examine our instructors beliefs through post-semester interviews in which they describe their self-perceived role in the classroom and comment on two different videos of TAs interacting with students. Comparisons are then made between TAs and LAs, and across teaching environments. As part of this study, we also seek to understand where changes in pedagogical conceptions and attitudes originate, in order to improve our overall method of preparing physics instructors.",Benjamin T.

One such study focuses on how students apply knowledge of light and basic geometric optics to the context of wavefront aberrometry.  In one aspect of this study we compared the application of previous knowledge of students who had studied light and basic geometric optics in a physics course with those who had not and thus could only apply knowledge obtained in an informal way.  We sought to examine what differences exist in the way they construct an understanding of wavefront aberrometry.  The data showed that students with no formal instruction tended to rely on experiential knowledge as one would expect.  However, the students with formal instruction relied on textbook knowledge and tended to discount or ignore their everyday experiences.  We will discuss what this difference in knowledge types might imply about the knowledge construction process

All students, enrolled in the second semester of an introductory course, took the CLASS survey. We used survey results to identify expert-like and non-expert like students to participate in the study. We selected 4 highest scoring and 4 lowest scoring students.

2550,Contributed Poster,Can We Assess Efficiency and Innovation in Transfer?*,"Schwartz, Bransford and Sears [1] propose a two-dimensional model that describes transfer in terms of efficiency and innovation.  Efficiency is the ability to apply prior knowledge to new situations quickly and accurately.  Innovation is the ability to question assumptions, let go of prior knowledge and generate new ideas.  Schwartz et. al. argue that most educational assessments focus on efficiency at the expense of innovation.  We suggest that this perspective does not adequately reflect the challenges that our students face while problem solving.  For instance, while faculty may find end-of-chapter physics problems to be routine and overly focused on efficiency, our students, who lack prior knowledge and experience may find these problems to be novel and innovative.  We propose an operational meaning of efficiency and innovation and development of criteria to measure these constructs in ways that reflect both students challenges as well as faculty expectations.

We have administered questions before and after traditional instruction and guided-inquiry activities that probe understanding of multiplicities, probabilities, and their distributions over N, covering more than 6 orders of magnitude in N.  Preliminary results indicate some positive learning outcomes, along with some persistent problems; e.g., confusion over the dependence of macrostate probability on multiplicity, and whether the probability of a single (N/2) macrostate emerges at large N to dominate the distribution, or not.  Results are discussed in the context of the term overwhelming probability, commonly used to describe the connections with equilibrium thermodynamic (very large N) systems.

Building on our conceptually-based clicker methodology, we conducted pilot studies to seek possible ways of promoting student problem solving skills through guided conceptual scaffolding. We created several question sequences, each consisting of two relevant conceptual questions plus one quantitative problem. Both questions and the problem synthesized concepts widely separated in the textbook. Synthesizing concepts is particularly difficult for students, and generally is not required for solving end-of-chapter problems. Participating students were divided into three groups: the first answered the conceptual questions before being asked to solve the problem.  The second received cueing on underlying concepts before attempting the problem.  The third was simply asked to solve the problem.

Experts are unlikely to make the same mistakes when asked to solve a problem a second time especially if they had access to the correct solution after their initial unsuccessful attempt. Here, we discuss a case study which explores if advanced physics students use the opportunity to learn from their mistakes.  The performance on the final exam shows a wide distribution of students' performance on problems administered a second time, which suggests that many advanced students may not automatically exploit their mistakes as an opportunity for learning, and repairing, extending, and organizing their knowledge structure.

We investigated the possibility that there were also other differences between these formats.

2741,Contributed Poster,Examining Change Strategies in University STEM Education,"Calls for change in STEM education have been made for over a decade. Yet change is hard to initiate, and difficult to sustain. In order to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that facilitate change in instruction in higher education, we surveyed existing literature that describes reform in STEM education. Through examining the strategies that researchers adopted, two dimensions of change strategies emerged: 1) change strategies either seek to impact individuals or the environments and structures; 2) the intended change outcome is either prescribed or emergent. With the aid of extra coding categories, we were able to better study the differences and similarities of the approaches adopted by researchers in three different fields: STEM education, higher education, and faculty development. In this talk we will present some of the results and discuss some implications for how to effectively promote change in STEM education.",Andrea Beach,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2741,Western Michingan University,"Yuhfen Lin, Charles Henderson, Noah D Finkelstein",2009
2590,Contributed Poster,Exploring Student Consistency in Vector Addition Method Choices,"The mathematical operation of two-dimensional vector addition arises in multiple physics contexts.  The vectors are presented with different features (axes, grids, etc.) depending on the values and physical contexts. As part of a larger survey developed by Van Deventer in 2007, we asked four two-dimensional vector addition questions, with different contextual features, in both a math and a physics context.  Consistent with the previous results of Meltzer and Nguyen (2003) we find that changing the graphical presentation of vectors may affect the methods students use to add vectors. We also conducted interviews consisting of two sets of five different two-dimensional vector addition questions with a distracter task between sets.  We expected that during the interviews students would change methods of vector addition based on the presentation of the vectors.  However, students used the method they used on the first representation, right or wrong, for all following representations.

2556,Contributed Poster,Facilitating Students' Transfer of Problem Solving Across Representations*,"Studies indicate that the use of multiple representations in teaching helps students become better problem solvers.  Students who learn in representation-rich environments are able to construct representations to help them solve problems.  We report on a study to investigate students difficulties with multiple representations and strategies to help students overcome those difficulties.  We conducted teaching/learning interviews with 20 students in a first semester calculus-based physics course.  Each student was interviewed four times during the semester, each time after they had completed an exam in class.  During these interviews students were first asked to solve a problem they had seen on the exam, followed by problems that differed in context and type of representation from the exam problem.  Students were provided verbal scaffolding to solve the new problems.  We present the interview protocols, common difficulties that students encountered and scaffolding that we provided students to help them overcome those difficulties.

In particular, faculty agree that E&M should be taught on an axiomatic basis (Maxwells equations) and they agree on the essential concepts in the course (fields and potentials). In contrast, we find a range of opinions about how to teach first-semester, junior-level quantum mechanics (QM). We surveyed over 15 faculty about their approaches to teaching QM, and reviewed several popular textbooks. Although there is broad agreement on the list and order of topics (Schrodinger equation to matrix methods and spin), we find substantial disagreement in several pedagogical aspects, including (1) the importance of presenting QM on an axiomatic basis (i.e. the postulates);  (2) the treatment of measurement in QM (in particular, the collapse of the wave function); and (3) the physical interpretation of the wave function (matter wave vs. information wave vs. something else).",Michael Dubson,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2684,"Physics Dept, University of Colorado at Boulder","Steve Goldhaber (goldy@colorado.edu),

2674,Contributed Poster,I Think I Can: Investigating the Impact of Physics Problem Solving on Student Self-efficacy*,"Proximal goal setting has been strongly linked to self-efficacy and often occurs in successful problem solving. A qualitative study, using both observations and interviews, investigated the problem-solving processes and the self-efficacy of two students enrolled in an introductory physics course that implemented Modeling Instruction at Florida International University. We found that the problem solving process could be divided into two main themes: the goal setting process and the self-efficacy feedback loop. Further, the goal setting process could not be isolated from its impact on the self-efficacy of the students. This relationship between the goal setting strategies within the problem-solving process and self-efficacy may be linked to the retention of students in physics. We present results of the study and its possible link to student retention.

Yet even for those with undergraduate course work in physics, they may not possess Newtonian conceptual understanding of force and motion, especially if they experienced traditional physics courses.  Thus, effective professional development is necessary to correct conceptual understanding in our science teachers to prevent perpetuating these misunderstandings.  This presentation investigates the effects of a one week workshop for in-service teachers on the teachers conceptual understanding of force and motion using the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation as the pretest and posttest.

In this work a preliminary implementation of modeling instruction in an introductory physics course of Mechanics in a Mexican university is analyzed. The Lawsons Test of Formal Reasoning and the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) were applied in the beginning of the semester, while the FCI was administered again at the end of the period in order to assess the concept learning of students. The students in modeling courses gained the double of concept learning than students in traditional courses. A stepwise correlational study was established between scientific reasoning, initial concepts and concept learning. The concept learning gain just exhibited correlation with the scientific reasoning, R = .454 (p < .001) for modeling instruction and R = .319 (p < .001) for traditional instruction, which proves to be one of the reasons for the observed difference in the concept learning gain.",Hugo Alarcon,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2699,Tecnologico de Monterrey,Jorge de la Garza,2009

Our data include CSEM results, DFW rates, course grades, and background information such as ACT scores.  As has been found in other environments, gender gaps exist but are reduced as we implement research-based course reforms, with the most persistent gaps residing in the CSEM normalized gains.

Developing a sense of community among students is one of the three pillars of an overall reform effort to increase participation in physics, and the sciences more broadly, at FIU. Our implementation of a research and learning community, embedded within a course reform, has led to increased recruitment and retention of physics majors. Finn and Rock [1997] link the academic and social integration of students to increased rates of retention. To identify these social interactions, we have initiated an investigation that utilizes network diagrams to identify primary community participants. Community interactions are then characterized through the networks density and connectivity, shedding light on learning communities and participation. Preliminary results, further research questions, and future directions utilizing social network analysis will be presented.

2739,Contributed Poster,Investigation of Students Alternative Conceptions of Vector Direction with Mexican Students,"In this work we investigate the more common alternative conceptions and difficulties of university Mexican students with the concept of direction of a vector before instruction. 
We present students difficulties with the vector direction concept due to the use of two conventions in the Mexican system. The common direction conception in the American system conflicts with a convention of this property as it is composed of two separate properties: direction as the line of action and sense as which way it points. Both conventions are regularly used in the Mexican educational system. 
Additionally, based on the work of Nguyen and Meltzer [1], we designed questions in which students are asked for direction of a vector without indicating any particular convention, and questions indicating the line of action convention. We compare responses of students in the two types of problems, we analyze alternative conceptions of direction in the first type (investigating in depth the ones detected in [1]), and alternative conceptions of direction and sense in the second type of problems.

By the time graduate students complete their degree they are expected to have shifted from recipients of knowledge to creators of knowledge. To distinguish these two different scenarios, we will introduce the idea of locus of authority. If students are to view knowledge as constructed by themselves rather than an object received from an authority figure, they need to start viewing themselves as an authority. Thus the locus needs to shift from external sources to within themselves. We will discuss the theoretical implications of this idea for the activities of learning, teaching, and research. Here, we will apply the locus of authority idea to examine how graduate students face the difficult task of being both student and teacher at the same time.",Yuhfen Lin,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2737,Western Michingan University,David T.

The BEMA has been given pre/post in freshman E&M (Physics II) courses, and the BEMA and CUE have been given as a pre/post-test in several upper-division E&M courses.   Some of the data extends over 10 semesters. We used PER-based techniques to transform the introductory and upper-division courses starting in Fall 2004 and 2007, respectively [2,3]. Our longitudinal data allows us to measure ""fade"" on BEMA performance between freshman and junior year.  We investigate the effects of curricula on students by comparing juniors who were enrolled in traditional vs transformed physics as freshmen, as well as those who were enrolled in transformed or traditional upper-division E&M I, using both BEMA and CUE measures.  We find that while freshman reforms significantly impact BEMA scores, junior-level reforms affect CUE but not BEMA outcomes.

Is it best to measure science teacher knowledge within individuals' science specialty, or can this be measured domain-generally for the sciences? In this research, we investigated this question by developing a physics-specific measure of science teacher knowledge. We then conducted an experiment in which we randomly administered a domain-general measure or the parallel physics-specific measure to a population of pre-service science teachers. We also interviewed and observed the teaching practices of two subsets of participants in order to contribute to our understanding of what is being measured.

We give an example of resource creation by analyzing four student groups separating variables in a group quiz setting.  The task was to solve an air resistance problem with uncommon initial conditions.   The fluency of each group is described by three observables:  use of overt mathematical language (such as divide, subtract, or equals), use of covert mathematical language (such as moving, bringing, or pulling over), and use of accompanying gestures (such as circling, grabbing, or sliding). For each group, the type of language and gesture used corresponds to how easily they carry out separation of variables.  We create resource graphs [1,2] for each group to organize our observations and use these graphs to describe a potential reification  process [3] for the procedural resources grouping and separate variables.

By participating in these homework forums, students have access to more knowledgeable peers and experts who voluntarily provide help and encouragement.  These forums provide a new context for studying help-seeking behavior, tutoring strategies, and can serve as a catalog of common student difficulties.  In this poster, we focus on the two largest english-speaking physics forums:  www.physicsforums.com and www.cramster.com.  For PhysicsForums, we collected a month's worth of tutoring exchanges for introductory physics homework.  We analyzed the participation structure of the exchanges by tabulating conversational turns, giving insight into the social interactions that occur. We also qualitatively analyzed the exchanges based on the quality of the instruction and the sophistication of the pedagogical approaches employed by the tutors.  In addition, we conducted a much briefer analysis of Cramster.

Seventeen children in a mixed-age second and third grade classroom participated in the study. In the first session the children explored MBL materials in a semi-structured manner. The second session followed the structure of ILDs (a structured prediction/observation/report approach). Each session lasted one hour. Qualitatively, the children demonstrated understanding slope (both direction and speed), and the graph as a narrative of motion. Qualitatively, children revealed that they were extending their understanding of the motion graph representation beyond the target instruction. This research summarizes an encouraging first step that PER has applications when working with much younger students, not only in teaching motion concepts but also in promoting the use of abstract tools.",Jason Kahn,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2658,Tufts University,"Ronald K.

In this study, we compare differences in student learning and sim investigation when the sim either shows or hides representations of abstract or invisible phenomena such as a magnetic field or electron flow in a wire.  Specifically, we conducted individual interviews with introductory-level university physics students, some of whom were using Faraday's Electromagnetic Lab as designed and others who used a version of the same sim but without the invisible representations.

Data were taken over a period of 17 weeks using differing representations of magnetic field.  Following instruction, a significant proportion of answers (approximately 30% given a magnetic pole representation of field and 20% given field line ) coincided with an overall sign error.  Potential sources of sign error (e.g. ""left-hand-rule,"" physical discomfort, non-commutativity of cross products) were investigated via additional test questions and student interviews.  Evidence from these additional experiments suggests that the sign errors are not systematic within students, but vary randomly.

We established a list of 11 such goals, such as  choose and apply the appropriate problem-solving technique and sketch the physical parameters of a problem. These goals, in conjunction with student observations and interviews, served as a guide for the working group to create the CUE assessment.  The result is a 17-question open-ended post-test (with an optional 7-question pre-test) diagnostic, with an accompanying grading rubric.  We present the preliminary validation of the instrument and rubric, plus results from 4 semesters at the University of Colorado, and 4 additional universities.",Stephanie V.

2584,Contributed Poster,Technology as a Lens for Examining Instructors Pedagogical Content Knowledge,"The relationship between instructors content knowledge and the chosen pedagogical approach (Pedagogical Content Knowledge - PCK) and its impact on student learning have been a focus of many studies. Usually they employ interviews, observations and surveys. We propose to analyze the instructors choice of educational technologies and corresponding pedagogical-technological decisions to investigate her PCK. For example, the instructors use of clickers can allow the researchers to gain significant information about her PCK even without observing the classes, just by inspecting such teaching materials as lecture notes. The analysis of the types of questions included in lectures, sequencing of the material covered, etc. should also reveal information about the instructor's Subject Matter Content Knowledge (SMCK). We propose the framework for doing such an analysis as applied to clicker technologies implemented by science and mathematics instructors. One of the biggest advantages of such an analysis compared to an interview is its objectivity.",Marina Milner-Bolotin,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2584,Ryerson University,"Tetyana Antimirova

2545,Contributed Poster,The Effect of Classroom Diversity on Conceptual Learning in Physics,"Introductory physics is taken annually by hundreds of undergraduates at Ryerson University. The diversity of our students (a large Canadian urban university) reflects the diversity of Toronto. Their educational backgrounds also vary substantially. Since students learning outcomes in the introductory science courses have a significant impact on their success in the science programs, we decided to investigate how student demographic and educational diversity affects their success in introductory physics. As expected, we found that the completion of a senior high school physics course positively impacts students success in the course. The unexpected result was that gender remained a predictor of the students success even when the completion of high school physics was accounted for. Interestingly, other demographic characteristics, (mother tongue, immigration, parental education) seem not to matter. The results suggest that the impact of completing high school physics may extend far beyond the first year, significantly hindering girls success in SMET disciplines.

2697,Contributed Poster,The Effect of Representations on Student Understanding of Motion,"Students intuitive ideas and tacit understandings about forces and motion are usually at odds with normative physics knowledge. In this project, we have developed a video game to increase students understanding of Newtonian mechanics by giving them an opportunity to explore and articulate their tacit understandings, while retaining the strong motivational components of current commercial game design. The game play involves students manipulating the motion of an object to navigate mazes or hit projectile targets. Different forms of representations of motion (such as vector arrows and motion maps) are utilized in the game. This study examines how visual and position-based aspects of the representations help or hinder students in gaining understanding of the concepts and articulating them in a context outside of the game. Specifically, we are looking at how students are able to coordinate multiple representations and use them to make sense of the physics concepts involved.",Cynthia D'Angelo,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2697,Arizona State University,"Doug Clark, Vanderbilt University",2009
2733,Contributed Poster,The Examination of Beginning Secondary Physics Teachers PCK through Two Different Research Lenses,"This study examines the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of beginning physics teachers through two different research lenses  cognitive and teacher education research. The cognitive research lens examines PCK through the nature of expertise. Beginning physics teachers are considered novices, and therefore exhibit certain characteristics in terms of knowledge structure and pedagogies specific to teaching physics. The teacher education research lens examines PCK as one element within the necessary knowledge for teaching. All teachers move through a continuum of professional development, where beliefs about teaching interact with different types of knowledge (content, pedagogical, context, and pedagogical content knowledge) and classroom practice. Each of these areas develops with time spent in the profession of teaching. Data collected from four beginning secondary physics teachers over their first two years of teaching are used to illustrate similarities and differences between these two research lenses, within the characterization and development of PCK for teaching physics.",Jennifer J.

In one section of an introductory physics laboratory course, every student had a Tablet PC that served as a digital-ink based lab notebook. With digital labbooks, students could seamlessly create hand-drawn graphics and equations, and write lab reports on the same computer used for data acquisition, simulation, and analysis. In another laboratory section, students used traditional printed lab guides, kept paper notebooks, and then wrote lab reports on regular laptops.

2679,Contributed Poster,The Relative Effectiveness of an Interactive Teaching Approach Using PDAs as Interaction Tool*,"Using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest comparison group research design, the relative effectiveness of an interactive teaching approach using personal digital assistants (PDAs) as interaction tool (experimental group) was compared with a similar teaching approach which used flashcards as the interaction tool (comparison group). Two introductory algebra-based physics classes were purposely selected as participants of the study. The descriptive analysis of the mean gain scores in the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) showed that there is a significant difference on the mean gain scores between the experimental and comparison groups. Furthermore, the calculated Cohens index of effect size (d=0.6988) indicates that the average gain scores in the experimental group exceeds 76% of the gain scores of the comparison group. Our data suggest that the interactive teaching approach using PDAs as classroom interaction device is more effective in promoting conceptual understanding compared to an interactive teaching approach using flashcards.

In this paper we demonstrate how practitioner (action) research and design-based research integrate to enable the scholarship of teaching as modelled by Boyer (1990) and Trigwell, Martin, Benjamin and Prosser (2000). A teaching development initiative, the workshop tutorials, will be used to exemplify both research methodologies.  An overlying interpretive theoretical perspective will be used to reflect on the evolution of the workshop tutorials. The perspective allows us to propose five key features that explain why design-based research offers a methodological framework for the broad description and conduct of scholarly inquiry into teaching and learning in physics and other disciplines.

In this study, we use an instrument employing standard multiple-choice conceptual questions (e.g., from CSEM) to collect data from students at regular intervals.  The questions are modified by asking students to distribute 100 confidence points among the options in order to indicate which options they think are more likely to be correct.  Tracking the class-averaged confidence ratings for each option produces a set of time-series.  Intervention ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) analysis can then be used to test for, and measure, structural changes in each series.  In particular, it is possible to discern which interventions (lectures, labs, etc.) were able to produce significant and sustained changes in class performance.

As such, we have administered epistemological surveys and conducted clinical interviews with students in introductory physics and basic circuits courses. A comparison of clinical interviews of two students, Matt and Emily, illustrates a trend: the tendency to hook up mathematical formalism to the physical intuition facilitates conceptual understanding and problem-solving.  Although Matt and Emily both possess the needed basic math skills and physical ideas, Matt solves problems more fluidly and successfully for two reasons: (1) he has formed cognitive units, called symbolic forms [1], in which an algebraic template is tied to a conceptual interpretation, and (2) his epistemological beliefs about math, unlike Emily's, support his using these symbolic forms as a central part of his problem solving.

Students successfully lit the bulb with a single wire in a variety of ways, but students from both classes showed and expressed the view that the bulb must be in direct contact with a battery in order for it to light. I offer an interpretation of this in terms of a resources perspective (diSessa, 1993; Hammer et al., 2005), where spontaneously generated explanations and actions are contextually sensitive.

2833,Invited Talk,Bridging Cognitive and Neural Aspects of Classroom Learning,"A major achievement of the first twenty years of neuroimaging is to reveal the brain networks that underlie fundamental aspects of attention, memory and expertise. We examine some principles underlying the activation of these networks. These networks represent key constraints for the design of teaching. Individual differences in these networks reflect a combination of genes and experiences. While acquiring expertise is easier for some than others the importance of effort in its acquisition is a basic principle.

Networks are strengthened through exercise, but maintaining interest that produces sustained attention is key to making exercises successful. The state of the brain prior to learning may also represent an important constraint on successful learning and some interventions designed to investigate the role of attention state in learning are discussed. Teaching remains a creative act between instructor and student, but an understanding of brain mechanisms might improve opportunity for success for both participants.",Michael Posner,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2833,Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology,,2009
2834,Invited Talk,Causality in Pieces: The Construction of Causal Schemes,"I will present two case studies of different early high school classes constructing (with no direct instruction from teachers) ways of explaining temperature equilibration. Students were asked to explain, when a cold glass of milk is left on the kitchen table, how and why does it come to room temperature? The first case study shows an unusually clear example where students build an essentially correct causal explanatory scheme (Newton's law of heating) pretty much simply by combining a number of reasonably well-documented intuitive ideas. The second case study shows a similar construction, but of an incorrect causal scheme. Because the elements used in the first case have been reasonably well-studied, we can determine both what had to change in the pieces and how the pieces were combined. This leads to a list of plausibly general ""mechanisms of learning.""",Andrea diSessa,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2834,University of California at Berkeley,,2009
2835,Invited Talk,Moving Between Discourses: From Learning-as-acquisition to Learning-as-participation,"These days, the times of incessant changes, everything seems to be fluid, including our ways of looking at the world and of talking about it. Although easily noticeable also in 'hard' sciences, nowhere is this conceptual fluidity more conspicuous than in research on human learning. In this talk, after a very brief historical review, I will concentrate on two basic metaphors for learning in which current educational research seems to be grounded: the metaphors of learning-as-acquisition and of learning-as-participation. It will be claimed that these metaphors generate discourses which are incommensurable rather than incompatible - discourses which, although seemingly contradictory, can live side by side without any risk to the consistency of the research enterprise. Researches should be choosing their leading metaphor according to their needs. Using empirical examples as illustration, I will discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of each of the two options.",Anna Sfard,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2835,Michigan State University,,2009
2836,Invited Talk,The Biology of Physics: What the Brain Reveals about Our Understanding of the Physical World,"Fundamental concepts in physics such as Newtonian mechanics are surprisingly difficult to learn and discover.  Physicists, philosophers, and educators have painstakingly detailed the use of concepts such as force yet the underlying mechanisms involved in the use of these concepts has been elusive.  Over the past decade we have been using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), brain damaged populations, and other neuroimaging techniques to uncover the neural substrates of conceptual change.  Using tasks derived from physics, chemistry, and biology we have found that conceptual change often involves the inhibition of prior knowledge and/or the recategorization of knowledge. The specific brain sites that we have discovered as being involved in conceptual change are the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate as well the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These regions are part of a network of brain sites that are involved in changes in knowledge use that are modulated both by experience and situational factors.  In this presentation I outline our findings and the implications for educational interventions.",Kevin Niall Dunbar,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2836,University of Toronto,,2009
2731,Round Table Discussion,Cognition of an Expert Tackling an Unfamiliar Conceptual Physics Problem,"We have investigated and analyzed in detail the cognition of an expert tackling a qualitative conceptual physics problem of an unfamiliar type.  The basic but non-trivial task was to find qualitatively the acceleration direction of a pendulum bob at various stages of its motion, originally studied by Reif and Allen.  Methodology included introspection, retrospection and self-reported metacognition. Different reasoning was used for different points on the motion path, revealing multiple facets of cognition, including its context- and background-dependence. An account will be given of the zigzag thinking paths and interplay of various reasoning modes and knowledge elements invoked. We interpret the cognitive processes using theoretical ideas such as: case-based, principle-based and experiential-intuitive reasoning; general strategies; schemata; association and transfer; cueing and interference; metacognition and epistemic frames. The rich microcosm of cognition brought out in this case study contrasts with the tidy systematic problem solutions we usually present to students.

The teaching practices and new curricular materials (homeworks, interactive lectures with clickers, and after-class help sessions and tutorials) were guided by the results of observations, interviews, and analysis of student written work to identify common student difficulties with the content, and were informed by explicit learning goals established in collaboration with faculty. In parallel, we are developing a conceptual test, the CUE (Colorado Upper-division Electrostatics instrument), to assess some of the impacts and ongoing evolution of the new curriculum. We present key elements of our research base for these course transformations, including instances where interactive engagement techniques, and our assessment tools and observations, help elucidate student difficulties at this level.

Since then it has transformed into a living organism, that nurtures new members (now more than 40 in-service teachers), cares for the needs of everyone, provides timely advice for every-day problems, communicates passion to teaching, and provides natural professional development for all of its members. The discussion will focus on the elements of a professional learning community that are absolutely necessary to maintain it, specific features of a physics teachers learning community, and the role of faculty responsible for teacher preparation in helping sustain such a community.",Eugenia Etkina,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2761,Rutgers University,,2009
2774,Targeted Poster,Categorization of Problems to Assess and Improve Student Proficiency as Teacher and Learner,"The ability to categorize problems is a measure of expertise in a domain. In order to help students learn effectively, instructors and teaching assistants (TAs) should have pedagogical content knowledge. They must be aware of the prior knowledge of students, consider the difficulty of the problems from students' perspective and design instruction that builds on what students already know. In this targeted poster, we discuss the response of graduate students enrolled in a TA training course to categorization tasks in which they were asked to group problems first from their own perspective, and later from the perspective of introductory physics students.  A majority of the graduate students performed an expert-like categorization of physics problems. However, when asked to categorize from the perspective of introductory students', most students expressed dismay, claiming that either the task was either impossible or pointless. We will discuss how categorization can be a useful tool for scaffolding and improving pedagogical content knowledge of instructors.",Chandralekha Singh,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2774,University of Pittsburgh,,2009

In this poster we situate PhET sims in a socio-cultural-historical context, focusing on the Wave Interference sim as an example. Sims are cultural tools designed to embody certain norms and practices of the physics community, particularly learning through exploration. This poster focuses on the interaction between three scales of cultural tools: representations (graphs, pictures, etc.), learning tools (sims), and learning environments. Sims can strongly influence the nature of student engagement in the classroom, but they are not magic pills. Classroom environments can drive certain types of activity, but we are not fated to recapitulate traditional educational practices.

Many researchers have examined student learning gains associated with activities utilizing technology. Less attention has been given to the role of tools in shaping classroom practices and student interactions. By emphasizing the mediating role tools play, activity theory is ideally suited for examining the impact of tools on classroom culture. This poster uses activity theory to explore two examples where Tablet PCs were used in introductory physics classes. In one example, every student used a Tablet PC to collaborate in small groups during a laboratory course. In a second example, groups of students in an active learning-based course used one Tablet PCs for group work, which the instructor projected during whole class discussions. Use of the Tablet PCs is identified with changes in the nature of student collaboration and in the classroom practices required to support desired class norms.",Edward Price,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2767,"California State University, San Marcos","Charles De Leone and Clarisa Bercovich-Guelman

2758,Targeted Poster,Learning about Student Learning in Intermediate Mechanics: Using Research to Improve Instruction,"Ongoing research in physics education has demonstrated that physics majors often do not develop a working knowledge of basic concepts in mechanics, even after standard instruction in upper-level mechanics courses.[1]  A central goal of this work has been to explore the ways in which students make--or do not make--appropriate connections between physics concepts and the more sophisticated mathematics (e.g., differential equations, vector calculus) that they are expected to use.  Many of the difficulties that students typically encounter suggest deeply-seated alternate conceptions, while others suggest the presence of loosely or spontaneously connected intuitions.  Analysis of results from pretests (ungraded quizzes), written exams, and informal classroom observations will be presented to illustrate specific examples of these difficulties.  Also to be presented are examples of particular instructional strategies (implemented in Intermediate Mechanics Tutorials2) that appear to be effective in addressing these difficulties.

2772,Targeted Poster,Modeling Applied to Problem Solving,"Modeling[1] Applied to Problem Solving (MAPS) is a pedagogy that helps students transfer instruction to problem solving in an expert-like manner.  Declarative and Procedural syllabus content is organized and learned (not discovered) as a hierarchy of General Models.  Students solve problems using an explicit Problem Modeling Rubric that begins with System, Interactions and Model (S.I.M.).  System and Interactions are emphasized as the key to a strategic description of the system and the identification of the appropriate General Model to apply to the problem.  We have employed the pedagogy in a three-week review course for students who received a D in mechanics.  The course was assessed by a final exam retest as well as pre and post C-LASS surveys, yielding a 1.2 standard deviation improvement in the students' ability to solve final exam problems and a statistically significant positive shift in 7 of the 9 categories in the C-LASS.

Classroom-based measures alone are insufficient to understand complex phenomena such as participation, retention, and persistence shown by our students.  The underlying Vygotskian perspective on learning in Modeling Instruction motivated a shift in unit of analysis, moving beyond standard measurements of physics classes toward understanding the patterns of interactions and participation in learning communities. Changing the unit of analysis from the class to the learning community allows us to consider the roles of social and cultural influences on participation, persistence and retention. In this poster we re-frame the CHEPREO reform efforts through an ecological framework [Aubusson] and describe how this framing supports students especially given the cultural makeup of FIU's student body.",Eric Brewe,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2762,Florida International University,"Laird Kramer,Vashti Sawtelle, Idaykis Rodriguez, George O'Brien

From the standpoint of the subject matter knowledge of the upper-level students, there was a striking persistence of common learning difficulties previously observed in students enrolled in the introductory course, accompanied, however, by some notable contrasts between the groups. More broadly, I will comment on comparisons and contrasts regarding general pedagogical issues among different student sub-populations, for example: differences in the receptivity of lower- and upper-level students to diagrammatic representations; varying receptivity to tutorial-style instructional approach within the upper-level population; and contrasting approaches to learning among physics and engineering sub-populations in the upper-level course with regard to use of symbolic notation, mathematical equations, and readiness to employ verbal explanations.",David E.

Each is considered from two different cultural historical activity theoretic perspectives, which provide the opportunity make sense of both the theory and the educational environments by triangulating among both the theories and the environments. An activity theoretic lens frames the classroom and afterschool program as activity systems where we delineate variation in roles, rules, and distribution of labor surrounding the use of similar tools (physics concepts). A Communities of Practice and Apprenticeship lens frames these environments as allowing or constraining various forms of participation by members both within the classroom community and within the institutional setting.

Thus, student learning and conceptual change is enhanced by instruction that creates opportunities for students to interact socially with others while engaged in appropriate learning activities. Models of instruction that promote social-interactions include Peer Instruction and community of learners (Brown&Campione,1994). This poster presents results from a case study of an introductory physics course using Peer Instruction. Audio recordings were made of small group conversations where students explained and justified their choices to peers. Discourse analyses of recordings show that students expend greater effort over time, build more rigorous arguments and regulate their discourse using both individual and collective processes of monitoring (eg. in time, peers use as well as demand more precise definitions and justifications before accepting arguments). Our results show changes in individual student's attitudes toward their personal and collective responsibility to classmates.",Elizabeth S.

Based upon cognitive apprenticeship model, we asked students to self-diagnose their mistakes and learn from reflecting on their problem solution.  Varying levels of scaffolding support were provided to students in different groups to diagnose their errors on two context-rich problems that students originally solved in recitation quizzes. The level of scaffolding necessary for successful self-diagnosis and performance on the transfer task was strongly dependent on the difficulty in invoking and applying physics principles to solve the problems and how far the transfer was. Moreover, a high level of sustained scaffolding may be necessary to teach students problem-solving skills.

Our data consists of diagnosis work by 180 Arab-Israeli high school physics students, and 30 American students taking introductory algebra based physics. The findings indicate that while the instructor expected students to focus on the weaknesses of their solutions, many reflected also on their personal involvement in the solution process, their opinion as to the adequacy of the problem statement, etc. Students used the sample solution as a template and identified as deficiency any external deviation of their solution from it.",Rafi' Safadi,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2777,"The Academic Arab College for Education in Israel, Haifa; Department of Science Teaching, Weizmann Institute of Science","Edit Yerushalmi, Department of Science Teaching, Weizmann Institute of Science.",2009

While the D group received 38% fewer total points than the A group, the differences were more dramatic with respect to getting an entire problem correct: for both analytic solutions and plans of attack the A group relative to the D group gave ~ 3.6 times more good answers, and failed to identify all of the physical principles about 3.8 times less often.  We found that students' written plans of attack closely correlated with their analytic solutions in both groups.

Their facility with energy and kinematics was comparable to D-level Freshmen. They were less able than D-level Freshmen to construct simultaneous equations describing a dynamics problem, but more able to recognize a two-stage problem and develop subgoals. Their mean score on the MBT was essentially unchanged from the post-test taken as Freshmen, though there were significant shifts in responses to ten of 26 questions.

We started with a Delphi Study based on interviews with experts, developed orthogonal responses to ""what should we teach non-physics majors besides the current syllabus topics?"" AAPT attendees, atomic researchers, and PERC08 attendees were asked for their selections. All instructors rated ""sense-making of the answer"" very highly and expert problem solving highly. PERers favored epistemology over problem solving, and atomic researchers ""physics comes from a few principles"". Students at three colleges had preferences anti-aligned with their teachers, preferring more modern topics, and the relationship of physics to everyday life and to society (the only choice with instructor agreement), but not problem solving or sense-making. Conclusion #1: we must show students how old physics is relevant to their world.

""Situation definition"" in the context of solving a physics problem refers both to realization of concepts and principles in physics that should be invoked to understand a situation, as well as to ""action patterns"" such as what the student is expected to do when approaching a problem.<br /><br />Assessment rubrics made available for students can serve to some extent to bridge the gap between students' and instructors' situation definition. Namely, assessment rubrics can serve to convey desired practices as well as to support students' in self diagnosing their work. For example, general, process-oriented problem-solving rubrics may convey desired problem solving approaches.<br /><br />This targeted poster session presents<br />a) examples of assessment and self diagnostic rubrics;<br />b) Dilemmas associated with their design such as how much credit to give to communicating the reasoning vs. Correct physics; and<br />c) research regarding their role in supporting the process of negotiating meaning from the point of view of the student and the instructor:  Do students perceive in the rubrics the message instructors hope to convey? What is their impact on learning?",Edit Yerushalmi,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2578,Weizmann Institute of Science,,2009
2625,Workshop,Methods and Experimental Designs in Cognitive Studies,"Whereas PER focuses on how students learn and perform physics tasks (especially those we are interested in teaching them), cognitive psychology research (CPR) focuses more broadly on how the mind works when engaged in cognitive tasks.  This talk will review some of the approaches to experimental design and methodology in CPR and PER, ranging from garden variety behavioral studies, to studies using eye-tracking devices functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The strengths and weaknesses of each method will be addressed in terms of what can, and cannot be learned about human learning, cognitive performance, and ultimately teaching. The session will conclude with views of what PER and CPR can learn from each other.",Jose P. Mestre,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2625,University of Illinois,Michael Posner,2009
2753,Workshop,Qualitative Research Methods,"This workshop for those who want to learn more about carrying out a qualitative research study. We will briefly review the Generic Inductive Analysis method and then participants will analyze two or three different types of qualitative data. Participants will code data, make claims, and support these claims with evidence from the data. We will also discuss benefits and limitations of qualitative research. Finally, we will review two different software packages for transcribing and analyzing data and we will review the article on qualitative research in the new volume Getting Started in PER. Participants will leave ready to launch into their own qualitative research study.",Valerie K. Otero,http://www.per-central.org/perc/2009/detail.cfm?ID=2753,University of Colorado at Boulder,,2009
