For PERC Document clustering run:

Algorithm: K-Means

There are 1842 documents in this file.
Uses the same logic of "FinalPres" clustering.
I would recommend running that file and then do the "PERCClustering".

First, we can start working by putting all documents into one file.
Note that the original documents are a little bit messy, so It needs to be reorganized, also the
years are missing, so add them too while they still in xlsx format.
Convert all excel documents to csv documents manually (txt), and make them open with notepad by default.
With all of that ready, we can start running the code in the following order:

Abstract_Concadenation2 (Writes all abstracts into one text file)
Abs_Formating (Extracts the abstracts and titles into 2 different text files)
FinalCode2 (Reads both text files produced previously and does the clustering.)
testing (Graphs the clusters in a year vs #documents plot, prints all points and the total number of docs per cluster)
