The National Science Teachers Association guidelines for preparing science teachers emphasize competent science safety knowledge. Best Practice dictates increasing the amount of student-centered hands-on science instruction which also increases the possibility of accident, especially in the classrooms of uninformed or untrained teachers. Phase I of this study sampled the science practice and classroom safety knowledge of a cross-section of K-12 science teachers in South Dakota to ascertain if teachers are aware of and trained in safe science practice. Are the teachers who have been trained in science safety practicing those procedures when they teach science? This study's data show that this may not be the case. Subsequent to this study, an analysis of the results from the safety survey will inform the design of a safety training certificate program for pre- and in-service teachers in South Dakota with the intent that teachers, once informed will practice science more safely.

This paper reports on the results of an experiment to test the use of a Peer Instruction (PI) in a high school environment. The study reports findings based on a population of 213 high school students attending algebra-based physics courses, both Honors and A level, taught by 5 different instructors. The results show a correlation between use of Peer Instruction and improved student conceptual understanding, as demonstrated by gains on a pre/post assessment instrument (FCI). However, there also appears to be a number of other factors that strongly influence the resulting gains. In addition to instructor differences, the data seem to indicate that students who are more physics-inclined and can answer questions correctly prior to instruction and prior to any Peer Instruction discussion subsequently achieve higher gains as measured by the FCI. While this is to be expected, the use of normalized gains is intended to mitigate this result, but it appears to be prevalent nonetheless. This raises questions as to what degree the FCI gains can be attributed to the use of Peer Instruction, to teacher differences, to student ability level or to simply increased familiarity with the question types presented on the FCI.

The existing collection of physics problems (both traditional and research-based) is becoming larger and more diverse.  In order to be efficiently used in classroom settings a classification of these problems is needed.  In the past few years we created a categorization of physics problems that establishes a connection between the physics problems, the type of declarative and procedural knowledge they involve and the cognitive processes they develop in students. This taxonomy is intended to be a valuable instructional resource for physics instructors which will enable them to select the problems used in their curricular materials based on the specifics of their students populations and the learning objectives they want to achieve for their class. This taxonomy will also provide a framework for creating physics-related assessments with a cognitive component. We will report on the design and validity and reliability studies that have been carried out during the development of this classification tool.

The poster will present two frameworks from Palinscar and Brown[1] that strikingly encompass decades of research on worked examples. First, their framework of beneficial learning behaviors from the reading comprehension literature will be aligned with the observed learning behaviors from the worked example literature. Second, their four propositions guiding the design of their training scheme will be used to categorize attempts to modify the design and implementation of worked examples.

This interdisciplinary project assessed the extent to which students in general education courses across two departments understood the assumptions of small-particle models and the ways in which these models relate to measurable properties. Many general education courses are surveys of a wide body of material, but spend relatively little time on fundamental issues such as the particulate nature of matter. Students are increasingly exposed to small particle models through animations on websites and visualizations in science textbooks, however relatively little time is spent on the interpretation and use of these models. The implicit assumption is that students have little difficulty with an idea as basic as the particulate nature of matter and are able to use small-particle models to explain the behavior of the observable, macroscopic world. As part of this project, we embedded conceptually-oriented questions on written assessments in general education courses in physics and chemistry. Questions were drawn from the published literature in chemical and physics education and developed by the research team. The results of this project provide a baseline measurement of the extent to which a diverse population of students in introductory physical science courses was able to develop and use particulate models to reason about macroscopic observables.

It has been reported that students lack conceptual understanding of vectors and consequently have difficulties performing basic operations needed in the physics curriculum. We report results of a study of conceptual understanding of vectors among college students in their first physics course in a large private university in Mexico. Students in this institution have conceptual difficulties similar to those of American students, such as identifying magnitude and direction of a vector and performing vector addition. Furthermore, Mexican students have difficulties with the multiplication of a vector by a scalar and more advanced addition/subtraction operations using that product operation even after instruction in which vectors were part of the course curriculum. This report includes a discussion of implications for instruction, preliminary results of the development of a worksheet as instructional strategy and the diagnostic test used in the study.

For several years the University of Colorado has been using undergraduate Learning Assistants (LAs) in their introductory science and math courses.  While the LAs have teaching duties very similar to graduate Teaching Assistants (TAs), first year LAs are also required to take an education course focused on teaching methods. The purpose of this course is to first help LAs improve their teaching in the university classrooms and to encourage some of the LAs to consider careers as K-12 science teachers.  Throughout the semester LAs are asked to reflect on their learning about teaching and on the applications of these concepts to their current teaching experience.  This poster will present an analysis of this learning experience from the perspective of the LAs.  The poster will also present how LAs evolve as teachers and as learners throughout this experience.

The physics program at Chicago State University (CSU) has adopted an instructional environment that embraces inquiry-based instruction, research on student learning, and instructional revision. Based upon successes in our introductory physics courses, we have expanded our program to include the introductory astronomy and modern physics courses at CSU and the introductory physics sequence at Olive Harvey College, a nearby urban community college. In this poster we describe our implementation, preliminary research on the effectiveness of our materials, and the successes and challenges we face as our project expands to different instructional environments.

Many active learning based physics courses use whiteboards as a space for groups to respond to prompts based on short lab activities, problem solving, or inquiry-oriented activities. Whiteboards are volatile; once erased, the material is lost. Tablet PCs and software such as Ubiquitous Presenter can be used as digital whiteboards in active learning classes. This enables automatic capture and archiving of student work for online review by students, instructors, and researchers. We studied the use of digital whiteboards in an active-learning introductory physics course at California State University, San Marcos. In this poster we examine the archival features of digital whiteboards, and characterize the use of these features by students and researchers.

The University of Maine Master of Science in Teaching program includes a pair of graduate courses entitled Integrated Approaches in Physics Education.  The courses integrate understanding of different elements of physics education research (PER), including research into student learning, content knowledge (CK) from the perspective of how it is learned, and reform-based curricula together with published evidence of their effectiveness.  Course elements include equal parts studying physics through proven curricula and discussion of research results from PER literature.  As part of our course development, we are researching course participants understanding of content, pedagogy, and education research.  We are also exploring assessment methods to analyze graduate student pedagogical content knowledge (PCK).  Early findings indicate that the courses improve both CK and PCK.  However, the improvement in these two arenas seems to be dependent on the background physics content knowledge of the student.

We report results from an interview study of prospective pre-service teachers serving as undergraduate Learning Assistants (LAs) in Florida International Universitys Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC) Project. The goal of the study is to investigate both characteristics of students drawn to the PhysTEC program and how they changed as a result of their first early field experience. Their early field experience included assisting in reformed physics classrooms and laboratories. Seven students were interviewed prior to and after their field experiences, using a protocol based on the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (C-LASS) instrument. Students completed the C-LASS and then were asked to explain their responses in interview sessions. Students were also asked about their background and experiences in physics courses. Results of the interview study and measured impact on course reform will be presented.

We apply the approaches of PER to a relatively under-studied population -- potential future physicists, or physics and astrophysics majors.  We have investigated student understanding of upper-division Electricity & Magnetism I using a variety of approaches, including: student interviews, analysis of homework and exams, and performance on the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment (BEMA) and a new content-specific post-course assessment test.  We find persistent difficulties with conceptual understanding, which can hamper student success in choosing and implementing correct problem solving strategies. We compare student understanding after participation in two courses  a traditional course, and one reformed using principles of active engagement and learning theory. All course materials and evaluation tools are available for use by other instructors and researchers.

Previous work on student understanding of graphical interpretation of slope, derivative, and area under curves in various physics contexts has shown substantial difficulties, most notably in kinematics. Concurrently, several reports point toward students lack of algebraic acumen as a likely cause for their low achievement in a physics classroom. In order to see if some of the documented issues arise from being asked mathematical questions about single- and multivariable calculus concepts in a physics course, we administered a brief survey on these basic concepts to students near the end of multivariable calculus. Some of the questions are based on our earlier work in thermal physics that are essentially stripped of their physics content. Initial findings show that even after three semesters of university-level calculus, students struggle with basic concepts of integration and differentiation. Individual survey items and summative scores will be presented.

Clickers have been increasingly used in modern physics classes to facilitate students conceptual learning. At the Ohio State University, we developed, validated and implemented a series of single-concept clicker sequences for the entire calculus-based introductory physics course. Uniquely, each clicker sequence targets the same fundamental concept but contains questions with diverse surface features. To assess the effect of clicker sequences on students conceptual understanding, we conducted a comparative study between two parallel classes (a clicker class and a non-clicker class) in the spring 2008 quarter. These two classes address the same topics on waves and optics and share identical materials, including labs, recitations, homework, quizzes and tests. Results for students increased conceptual learning gains in the clicker class as compared to the non-clicker class are promising.

Previous research (Lindell, 2001) [NEED REFERENCE AT BOTTOM, OR REMOVE CITATION] showed that college students' lunar phases concept domain consisted of eight dimensions: Period of Moon's orbit, Period of Moon Phases, Direction of Moon's orbit around the Earth, Motion of the Moon in the sky, Phase and Sun-Earth-Moon relationship, Phases-Location in the Sky-Time of Observation relationship, Cause of Phases and Effect of Location on Earth on observed phase. Each dimension uncovered has a number of facets, each representing the scientific correct answer, as well as the different alternative models possible. In a follow-up study, interview data was collected from 25 pre-service elementary education majors. This additional study uncovered previously undiscovered difficulties students had with lunar phases. The discovery of these new difficulties resulted in the need to revise the original concept domain. The new revised concept domain will be presented.

We present results demonstrating similar distributions of student scores, and statistically indistinguishable gains on two popular research-based assessment tools: the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment (BEMA) and the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism(CSEM). To deepen our understanding of student learning in our course environment and of these assessment tools as measures of student learning, we identify systematic trends and differences in results from these two instruments. We investigate correlations of both pre- and post- conceptual scores with other measures including traditional exam scores and course grades, student background (earlier grades), gender, a pretest of scientific reasoning, and tests of attitudes and beliefs about science and learning science. Overall, for practical purposes, we find the BEMA and CSEM are roughly equivalently useful instruments for measuring student learning in our course.

We discuss the effect of administering conceptual and quantitative isomorphic problem pairs (CQIPP) back to back vs. asking students to solve only one of the problems in the CQIPP in introductory physics courses. Students who answered both questions in an CQIPP often performed better on the conceptual questions than those who answered the corresponding conceptual questions only. Although students often took advantage of the quantitative counterpart to answer a conceptual question of an IPP correctly, when only given the conceptual question, students seldom tried to convert it into a quantitative question, solve it and then reason about the solution conceptually. Even in individual interviews when students who were only given conceptual questions had difficulty and the interviewer explicitly encouraged them to convert the conceptual question into the corresponding quantitative problem by choosing appropriate variables, a majority of students were reluctant and preferred to guess the answer to the conceptual question based upon their gut feeling.

This poster describes a curricular process and its comparison with the communicative conception of physics education.

The curricular process of physics is a sequence of variant forms of curriculum mutually interconnected by six transformations, starting with the non-curricular member of the sequence  the scientific system of physics: 

CT1 = scientific system to conceptual curriculum,
CT2 = conceptual curriculum to intended curriculum,
CT3 = intended curriculum to project curriculum,
CT4 = project curriculum to operational curriculum,
CT5 = operational curriculum to implemented curriculum,
CT6 = implemented curriculum to attained curriculum.

The subject of physics education in the communicative conception is the educational communication of physics, which is defined as a continuous process of transfer of the scientific physical knowledge and methods into the minds of learners.

As part of an ongoing study to develop methods to do quantitative assessment of student writing and therefore measure the effectiveness of writing to learn, a framework was developed to analyze student textbook summary writing in physics.  The framework was based on Waywood, which defines three cognitive levels seen in mathematics journaling: recounting (telling what happened), summarizing (putting it into your own words), and dialoging (sense-making).  This framework was refined, expanded, and tested in the context of analyzing student textbook summary writing in introductory physics.  The students participating in this study were enrolled in the 2007 spring semester of the Foundation Physics Course at the University of Cape Town, a component of the special access program which contains mostly second language English speakers.

This study probes the states of knowledge concerning three physics concepts, Newtons Third Law, Newtons Second Law, and the Motion/Force Relationship, as measured by several groups (factors) of FCI items. These knowledge states are not postulated, but rather extracted FCI pre/post instruction records from three universities. For each factor, via patterns of response, students were statistically grouped into latent classes, subsequently seen to correspond to (groups of) specific student misconceptions. Using Latent Transition Analysis we estimated the (transition) probabilities of students moving, pre/post, between such classes. Transitions in these factors seem uni-directional, towards classes corresponding to fewer misconceptions, indicating gains in understanding at all three universities. However, students in some latent classes are unlikely to learn, and students starting in the bottom classes appear to have virtually no chance of transitioning to the top. These results/methods can aid physics educators by providing detailed assessment of instructional effectiveness.

Over the past eight years at McDaniel College, students predictions to various Interactive Lecture Demonstrations (ILDs) have improved markedly. One explanation is that students have become increasingly sophisticated in their understanding of kinematics and dynamics. Another possible explanation is that the class as a whole is only slightly more sophisticated, and during the discussion phase of an ILD the correct prediction is very successfully transmitted within groups and between groups. To help begin to address this idea, I created a preliminary, computer-based simulation of classroom discussion.

The Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM) is regularly administered to students at the beginning of the semester as a pretest and at the end of the semester as a post-test in a large private university in Mexico. About 500 students each semester, from different engineering majors, take electricity and magnetism, divided into sections of 30-40 students so there are several different instructors, both full-time and part-time. We report on the analysis of the CSEM data using concentration analysis for the purpose of evaluation of instruction. The results showed that students learning is dependent on instructor and on CSEM concept area. Students have large learning gains in some concept areas but small learning gains in others. Deeper analysis of a concept area showed that some instructors may tend to strengthen some misconceptions that students have. The analysis can be used to give feedback to instructors for the purpose of improving instruction.

Clickers have been used for a number of years to help create active learning environments in the lecture classroom [1,2].  Researchers have shown that clickers stimulate student-student and student-lecturer interaction.  In addition, students value the use of clickers and feel that these devices contribute to their understanding [3].  Unfortunately, there are few research studies focusing on how knowledge is enhanced through their use.
To contribute to this body of research, we compared student responses on exam questions to similar or identical clicker questions presented during lecture.    Analysis of the responses to clicker and exam questions show how individual student knowledge evolves during instruction.  Although there is evidence of improvement during lecture, our results indicate that many students struggled when the questions were posed on exams.  In this poster, we present the findings from this study and discuss how open-ended questions and interviews allow us to better understand how clickers are affecting our instructional environment.

Students use a variety of problem-solving strategies involving geometric reasoning as they solve upper-division E&M problems in Oregon State Universitys Paradigms in physics courses. Seven classroom cameras were used to capture six groups of three students each as they solved a variety of electrostatic and magnetostatic problems. We look at two examples of student problem solving to illustrate the types of things students find challenging and the types of strategies they employ. In one example, students struggled with how to use integration as chopping and adding to find the electric potential in all space due to a static ring of charge. A second example shows interesting issues students address while finding the current for a spinning ring of charge Q, radius R, and period T. An analysis of classroom video shows some of the wrestling, sense making, geometric reasoning, and problem-solving strategies these groups used to eventually make fruitful progress.

Although decades of research have identified effective instructional practices for improving Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education, these practices are not widely implemented.  Scholars in three fields are interested in promoting these practices and have engaged in research on pedagogical change.  Disciplinary-based STEM Education Researchers (SER) focus on changing curricula and pedagogical materials.  Faculty Development Researchers (FDR) focus on changing faculty.  Higher Education Researchers (HER) focus on policies and structures.  There is little interaction between the fields and efforts in all areas have met with only modest success. We have systematically analyzed journal articles since 1995 related to instructional change to describe and critique the change efforts of these three fields.  Results suggest that approaches to change differ by fields in important ways that have implications for their success.  We hope this literature review and related efforts will result in improved interdisciplinary work towards the facilitation of lasting change.

Two complementary, nationally recognized programs in PER are designed to capitalize on students' identities in efforts of recruiting and preparing more and better elementary, middle, high school, and college physics teachers and their students. The CU Boulder Learning Assistant (LA) Project is designed to help students expand their identities from physics majors to physics teachers. The Physics and Everyday Thinking Project is designed to help non-majors expand their identities from elementary teachers to elementary physics teachers. Both programs have demonstrated success in facilitating change among students. These data will be presented and discussed. Inferences will be made about which elements of each program seem to be effecting change. Emphasis is placed on how we help future teachers recognize and capitalize on their own students conceptual, cultural, linguistic, and social resources.

External representations, including pictures, graphs, text, gestures, and utterances, are key components of all curricular materials in physics. Such representations play a key role in cognitive function, particularly insofar as individuals interpret the meanings of and apply meanings to these representations. We have proposed a model of how individuals can make meaning of and with external representations through layered analogies and applied this model to learning abstract ideas in physics, i.e. EM waves. [1] [2] We extend this model in two ways. (1) We distinguish individuals interpretations of representations, which can be highly variable and fleeting, from the physics communities agreed upon interpretations, which are more stable and coherent. (2) Two characteristics of representation use emerge: abstraction based on the community consensus of concepts and salience based on readily accessible pieces of knowledge for an individual.

Differentials are widely used in mathematics and applied in physics and engineering courses. However, there is little understanding of the concept of differentials among undergraduate students. This paper is part of an ongoing project to understand how differentials are taught in mathematics classrooms and used in physics undergraduate courses taken by a diverse group of engineering majors. To that end, we analyzed the mathematics instruction based on what is taught; specifically, we looked at the most commonly used calculus textbooks for a first-year calculus course. It is our claim that the way differentials are introduced in mathematics textbooks does not support undergraduate student understanding of the use of differentials in physics and engineering.

Pre and post test data were collected using this survey in addition to FCI pre and post data and Lawsons Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning.  In this poster, the status of this current research will be presented along with a discussion of implications and limitations.

Before we can develop effective, research-based professional development programs for graduate student physics TAs, we must first identify their current classroom practices and why they engage in these practices. Framing, a theoretical framework developed  in sociology and linguistics, provides an analytical toolbox for examining the expectations that guide the actions and attention of individuals while teaching. We use framing to develop fine-grained analyses of two episodes of TAs teaching tutorials. Despite the differences in their behaviors, the two TAs are in a sense both doing the same thing; they organize their interactions with students around searching for indicators that the students understand the targeted ideas.

The education and cognitive science literature contains a wide range of ideas about problem solving in math and science and the teaching of scientific problem solving.  Neuroscience studies provide a rich source of information about how the brain works at the cellular level and the location of brain activity while using specific processes. We use the results of research in these fields to frame the 44 specific component processes that were identified while interviewing a wide range of people solving a wide range of in-depth problems during the development of the CAPS (Colorado Assessment of Problem Solving).  Understanding the component processes used in problem solving provides insight for improved teaching.  We will present ways that solvers can compensate for certain weaknesses, show stoppers (processes that are required to solve a problem) and provide a sampling of cognitive processes that are needed in the real world but are not taught in the classroom.

Expert problem solvers are characterized by continuous evaluation of their progress towards a solution. One characteristic of expertise is self-diagnosis directed towards elaboration of the solvers conceptual understanding, knowledge organization or strategic approach. Self-diagnosis tasks aim at fostering diagnostic behavior by explicitly requiring students to present diagnosis as part of the activity of reviewing their problem solutions. We have been investigating how introductory physics students perform in such tasks.  
Developing a robust rubric is essential for objective evaluation of students' self-diagnosis skills. We discuss the development of a grading rubric that takes into account introductory physics students' content knowledge as well as analysis, planning and presentation skills. Using this rubric, we have found the inter-rater reliability to be better than 80%. The rubric can easily be adapted to other problems.

Recently, many students have been losing their interest in physics. One of the essential reasons why students look away from physics is the fact that they face difficulty in solving physics problems. Since mechanics is a fundamental subject in physics, many researchers have studied how students learn mechanics and solve problems related to mechanics. However, there is little research on the students' specific difficulties in the process of problem solving. This study investigated students specific difficulties (with degrees of difficulties) and the core sources of these difficulties. Twenty-five university students who majored in physics education participated in this study. We have developed a framework, the House Model, for helping and analyzing students' problem solving. We found that students felt greater difficulty in planning and executing steps than in visualizing, knowing and finding steps. As the problems grew in difficulty, this pattern became more distinct. We will also describe the sources of the students difficulties and discuss the educational implications of these results.

We have reported previously that upper-level thermodynamics students demonstrate an inability to correctly equate the mixed second-order partial derivatives of the state function of volume (nonzero quantities in general), arguing instead that these derivatives must identically equal zero.[1]  Here we document the presence of this difficulty among students enrolled in a multivariable calculus course.  Data were gathered via diagnostic questions structurally identical to those administered in the thermodynamics course, yet devoid of physical context.  We additionally present a guided-inquiry tutorial sequence that was specifically developed to address this and related student difficulties with partial derivatives encountered in our research.  The sequence uses a graphical interpretation of partial derivatives in the context of an ideal gas P-V-T surface to bridge the abstract mathematical concepts with concrete physical properties.  Preliminary results indicate that the sequence effectively addresses the above difficulty, and also positively impacts student performance on related topics.

We report results from a study of pre and post assessments of students enrolled in reformed and non-reformed introductory physics laboratory sections. The goal of the study was to assess the results of the impact of Florida International Universitys (FIU) PhysTEC reform of introductory physics labs.  Prospective pre-service teachers were trained and placed in six lab sections serving as undergraduate Learning Assistants (LAs) and implementing tutorial-based curriculum. LAs facilitated epistemological and metacognitive discussions designed to challenge and then refine student understanding of physics concepts. Conceptual understanding and beliefs about physics of students in the six reform sections were compared with students enrolled in non-reformed laboratory settings. Students completed the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) [1], the Maryland Physics Expectation Survey (MPEX 2) [2], and common exam questions embedded in the exams for their regular physics classes. Results of the study and measured impact of lab reform will be presented.

Tutorials in Introductory Physics from the University of Washington have become widely recognized as one of the more successful educational strategies for teaching physics. They were originally developed in English and have been translated to different languages. Instructors in non-English speaking countries wanting to implement Tutorials therefore have a choice between using the materials in the original English versions, and consequently teaching in a language other than the native language of most of their students, or using translations into the local language.  We present two experiences: a large private university in Mexico and a small public university in Germany, both of which use the Tutorials as the main strategy for physics courses. Through analysis of empirical data on student performance, we have been investigating to what extent the effectiveness of such materials is affected by their translation when the instruction is in the local language or by the non-native language capabilities of the participating students when the instruction is in English.

Statistical Physics is an intermediate course for engineering physics students at Tecnologico de Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico. Prior to this course, students have taken a traditional lecture-based introductory course in thermal physics and a thermodynamics course focused on thermal processes. In order to review some important required concepts at the beginning of the course, such as the behavior of an ideal gas and the First Law of Thermodynamics, two Tutorials designed by the Physics Education Group  at the University of Washington have been used. In this implementation, students have taken the pre- and post-tests recommended by the authors, have worked on the Tutorials assisted by qualified teaching assistants and have solved tutorial problems in cooperative groups. We present the results of the implementation and contrast them to previous results reported by the authors of these particular Tutorials when used by US students.

We examine how the University of Colorado has created a sustained use of a research-based curriculum in two courses simultaneously, despite the significant increases in cost and time commitment. The adoption of the research-based University of Washington Tutorials in Introductory Physics [1] curriculum required significant pedagogical shifts in the role of students, faculty and their interactions. We describe both successful and unsuccessful hand-offs of the curriculum to professors from traditional physics research disciplines.[2] Through faculty interviews, we capture a shift in how professors talk about this curriculum, as well as their views about teaching and learning physics before and after they implement the tutorial curriculum. We find that teaching with the Tutorial curriculum can result in shifts in professors' views about teaching and learning physics, although this does not always happen. We describe characteristics of the professor's participation in implementing this curriculum and in the professor's background in order to make sense of when we do and do not see shifts.

We have used LabVIEW visual programming to build an interactive tutorial to promote conceptual understanding in physics problem solving. This programming environment is able to offer a web-accessible problem solving experience that enables students to work at their own pace and receive feedback. Intuitive graphical symbols, modular structures and the ability to create templates are just a few of the advantages this software has to offer. The architecture of an application can be designed in a way that allows instructors with little knowledge of LabVIEW to easily personalize it. Both the physics solution and the interactive pedagogy can be visually programmed in LabVIEW. Our physics pedagogy approach is that of cognitive apprenticeship, in that the tutorial guides students to develop conceptual understanding and physical insight into phenomena, rather than purely formula-based solutions.  We demonstrate how this model is reflected in the design and programming of the interactive tutorials.

The physics program at Chicago State University (CSU) is currently involved in making major revisions to the introductory physics courses as a result of funding from the National Science Foundation - Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) Program. Underlying these revisions is a strong research component that seeks to assess the effectiveness of these instructional innovations. 
This project has involved over half the faculty in the Physics Program and over ten student researchers who received degrees or are currently pursuing degrees in science. These students have been involved in curriculum development, research on student learning, and work as laboratory and classroom facilitators. Because of the large scope of departmental involvement the project has evolved into a community endeavor in which both faculty and students play an active role in program innovations. 
In this poster we discuss how undergraduates have been involved in the project and describe the benefits of involving science majors in education research.

Latent response analysis of students answering questions on an on-line administration of the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE) provides information on student reading patterns and the role of mental models. Regression analysis shows that response times are related to group and specific question text, but not to text or graphs in answer choices, indicating that students consistently read through the former but not the later. Response times also provide information on student use of mental models. Instruction reduced response times on responses consistent with Newtons laws while alternative concepts were unchanged. Among students who utilized both Newtonian and alternative concepts, no evidence was seen for activation of both models on the same question.

In our introductory calculus based physics class, students learn to solve and assess problems using rubrics. The problems are complex, involving multiple concepts and stages (for example, using conservation of momentum and conservation of energy, in different stages). The rubrics have detailed but generic descriptors for different categories: physics concepts, representations, modeling the situation, problem-solving machinery, and reasonableness of answer. At previous meetings, we have shown that students improve upon evaluation abilities and learn to successfully use the rubrics for peer- and self-assessment, if they are also provided with taxonomies that connect the rubric items with a specific problem. In this poster, we first explore the effects of making the assessment more formative: how do students perform if they have to solve a problem, write a taxonomy, self-assess their work, and then revise their solution based on their taxonomy and self-assessment? We also discuss students' perceptions of the rubrics.

In a 2005 American Institute of Physics report, Ivie and Ray showed that 46% of the students taking physics at the high school level are women. Yet, only 22% of the bachelor's degrees in physics are awarded to women. Often referred to as the leaky pipeline, it is evident that a large hole exists between high school and college. This investigation will examine how the gender learning gap, the difference in learning gains experienced by men and women, affects participation of women in high school physics. We will present an overview of the investigation study design including the interview protocol, focusing on the persistence of high school women in physics, epistemological surveys, and pre/post diagnostics to be used in evaluating the actual and perceived learning gap. The presentation will include a discussion of the issues that were considered in creating the study design.

An introduction to techniques of network analysis, based upon graph theory and statistics, is presented.  These techniques allow rigorous quantification and hypothesis-testing of the interactions inherent in social groups.  For example, the impact of stable intrinsic characteristics of individuals on their social interactions may be determined.  Some aspects of network analysis which are useful for physics education are reviewed, along with several examples using data from videotaped laboratory groups.

We describe the University of Colorado Partnerships for Informal Science Education in the Community (PISEC) program in which university volunteers participate in classroom and after school science activities with K-12 students in the local community.  We use technology in innovative ways to engage the students and teach about science, and the nature of science.  Across several different K-12 environments, we use stop action motion (SAM) movies [1] and simulations from the physics education technology project (PhET) [2] in which the students can creatively show and tell their understanding of the science.  This provides an alternative way for reluctant or ESL students who may have trouble writing their ideas.  We present the model of university community partnership, and demonstrate its utility in a case study one 3rd grade student learning about velocity and acceleration.

A prominent approach towards understanding the source of naive misconceptions in science argues that misconceptions arise due to novices' commitment to categorizing physics processes (such as heat, current) as substances and that there is a significant cognitive barrier to re-categorizing these concepts correctly [1]. Methodologically, this approach assumes a one-to-one correspondence between verbal expression and ontology in the mind. Previously, we have used this methodology to show that expert as well as novice reasoning of a concept is not constrained within a single ontological category [2]. Here we present an alternative way to model students' ontologies, without the assumption binding verbal expression directly to ontologies. We model a graduate student's reasoning about heat in terms of the conceptual resources [3] that she uses. We claim that clusters of closely-associated resources activated in the moment reflect her ontology of heat and explore how her epistemological stance influences her ontology of heat over the course of her explanation*.

In the last decade, the results of Physics Education Research (PER) and research-based instructional materials have been disseminated from traditional research universities to a wide variety of colleges and universities. Nevertheless, the ways in which different institutions implement these materials depend on their students and their circumstances.  Despite the fact that the use of these materials is so prevalent there is little research on the effectiveness of these materials with different populations of students.  This poster compares pretest data on different topics of mechanics for students in elite research universities and underprepared students in four-year colleges and universities. I seek to identify effective practices as well as continuing challenges to improve physics education for diverse undergraduate students.

We report on a preliminary study of pre-service education majors, their conceptual understanding of physics principles, and their attitudes toward science.  About 50 students participated in an intensive three-week interim course on descriptive physics. Participants included elementary education, special education, and multiple abilities majors, but no secondary education majors. Teaching methods were highly interactive.  Topics covered included forces and motion, energy, electricity, sound and light.  Although students had a very low FCI score on the pretest, their gains after just a week of instruction were impressive (Hake gain = 0.28).  Results of a post-course attitude survey (CLASS) will be presented, and plans for further study of this important set of students will be outlined.

In this paper, we present a new representation to help students learn about momentum, impulse and conservation of momentum.  We call this representation an Impulse-Momentum Diagram.  We include a description of these diagrams as well as examples on how instructors can use them in the classroom.  Next, we present preliminary quantitative and qualitative data on a study where students used these representations to learn the previous physics concepts.  Our final analysis shows how students benefit from these representations.

Since the fall of 2005 a course blog has been used in introductory physics courses at Creighton University to discuss real-world applications of physics and engage students in discussion and thinking outside of class. Specifically, the blog was created to address elements of the "hidden curriculum" that are difficult to cover in class. Previous work showed that students who posted to and read the blog did not suffer a deterioration in attitude/expectations as seen elsewhere using the MPEX or CLASS instrument. Here we analyze the content of student posts to the blog along several dimensions: student interactivity, self-disclosure of previous knowledge, integration of outside information, and links made between posts and specific physical concepts. Students' online discussion behavior is analyzed and compared to the results on standard assessment instruments like the FCI, CSEM, and DIRECT tests to determine if discussion behavior is linked to student learning. We also present gender differences in student's online discussion behaviors.

We have investigated how students tackle problems in geometric optics involving ray construction, to try to understand the nature and origin of the surprisingly wide variety of students solution attempts. We find that students use various reasoning modes and knowledge elements in conjunction. Their thinking may usefully be described as an interplay of principle-based and case-based reasoning, drawing on a knowledge mixture of basic principles, procedures, specific cases and recalled result features. Even though we usually present solutions and teach problem-solving as a systematic application of principles, real cognition is more complex. Associative thinking in terms of prior cases seems to be a strong natural tendency of both novices and experts. However novices are not easily able to discriminate the specific from the general, and tend to lack epistemic awareness and metacognitive skills. Our research findings will be illustrated by examples of student thinking on a basic reflection problem. Implications for learning and  instruction will be discussed.

The Physics Education Technology (PhET) project develops interactive, research-based simulations of physical phenomena that emphasize interactivity, animation, and real world connections. We are seeking a better understanding of how students learn from simulations (sims) in order to inform both simulation design and use.� We find that the type of guidance provided to the student controls the amount of independent exploration and inquiry in which the students engage. It is common for teachers to create activities that include specific instruction on how to manipulate the sim, but too much
 instruction seems to limit the benefits of a complex simulated environment.  We will report on our recent research in this regard, involving careful study of students' interaction with a few select sims.  Results of this study improve our understanding of how students learn complex physical concepts using sims, and have implications for designing effective sim-based in-class activities, homework and labs.

The Paradigms team at Oregon State University has developed a quantum mechanics curriculum aimed at middle division students that begins with a strong emphasis on using matrices and Dirac notation to describe quantum systems. This content ordering relies on students being able to understand quantum mechanical operators, eigenstates and quantum measurement without prior instruction on wave functions. We have analyzed classroom video and student interviews to identify resources students use when considering these quantum ideas. Identification of these resources will inform introductory curricula that are prerequisite to the quantum Paradigms and inform the development of Paradigms materials that will guide students to use these resources productively.

I am in the third year of an Ohio Math Science Partnership (OMSP) called the Southwest Ohio Science Institutes (SOSI). I am working with faculty from several area universities and curriculum specialists from many school districts to plan and deliver professional development to hundreds of teachers each summer. The Math Science Partnerships are funded by the No Child Left Behind Act and administered by the states. They require partnerships between science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) faculty and school districts. I will describe the partnership we have as we run SOSI, paying special attention to the contributions of STEM faculty. Faculty help plan the institutes, review curriculum, help deliver instruction, and participate in Ask a Scientist and Ask a Mathematician programs during the school year.

An upper level E&M course (i.e. based on Griffiths) involves the extensive integration of vector calculus concepts and notation with abstract physics concepts like field and potential.  We hope that students take what they have learned in their math classes and apply it to help represent and make sense of the physics.  This poster looks at how students in an upper level E&M course interpret (i) mathematical notation used to represent vectors and vector fields and (ii) diagrams used to represent vector fields.  I present preliminary data from student interviews and paper and pencil worksheets that suggest some difficulties with interpretation are related to ambiguities in notation that are context dependent.

In the physics education research community, a common format for evaluation is pre- and post-tests. At The Ohio State University, we take advantage of our large class sizes by collecting more frequent data points. The data cover the first two quarters (mechanics, E&M) of a calculus-based introductory sequence populated primarily by first- and second-year engineering majors. Different subpopulations of students are evaluated every week of the quarter using a variety of conceptual and procedural tasks related to different topics in the curriculum. Unsurprisingly for a traditional introductory course, there is little change on many conceptual questions. However, some student ideas peak and decay during a quarter, a pattern expected from memory research yet unpredicted by pre-/post-testing.  In addition, some correct ideas decrease dramatically when newer topics interfere with prior knowledge.   This research is partially supported by a grant from the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education (#R305H050125).

As part of ongoing research into upper-level undergraduate student understanding of thermodynamics at the University of Maine, we report on students' understanding of thermodynamic work, internal energy and the associated mathematics.
 New interview data of physics majors, as well as written data obtained in a calculus III class, support our previous findings and provide for a more in-depth look into factors impacting student difficulties with thermodynamic quantities.
Analysis of written and interview data has revealed student conceptions about integration that might otherwise be interpreted as conceptual difficulties with the physics.  The data suggest that students' application of the state function concept to thermodynamic work may be due in part to incorrect conceptions regarding integration.  The data also suggest that students lack the correct mathematical foundation of the state function concept, which may be a factor in its indiscriminate application.

Introductory courses in classical physics appear to be promoting in students a perspective we are calling local realism, where, for example, it is assumed that a particles position and momentum have simultaneous reality  both physical quantities can be described with well-defined values at all times.  Such a perspective can be problematic for introductory quantum physics students, who must develop new epistemic and ontological resources in order to properly interpret what it means to have knowledge of quantum observables.  We document this evolution in student thinking in part through pre/post-instruction evaluations using the CLASS survey.[1]  We further characterize variations in student epistemic and ontological commitments by examining responses to coupled essay questions and quantum attitudes statements.  We find that, despite performance level in the course, many students are still exhibiting a realist perspective in some quantum contexts. We also find that this effect can be significantly influenced by instruction, where we observe variations for courses with differing learning goals.

We discuss how students enrolled in a conceptual physics class for future elementary school teachers progress through the CoMPASS (Concept Map Project-based Activity Scaffolding System) curriculum for inclined planes.  The curriculum challenges students to design the best inclined plane to lift a pool table into a van.  We have found that students typically predict the correct type of board (long and smooth) to complete the challenge, but their responses include evidence of both physics and everyday reasoning.  After working through the materials, the majority of students understand the relationship between distance and force in the inclined plane as well as why the inclined plane is useful to lift heavy objects.  However, students have difficulty both relating a planes steepness to the force required to pull an object and discussing work in a scientifically correct manner.

In this study we explore the use of expert-designed structure maps by students in an algebra-based physics course and the evolution of these maps based upon students reactions and feedback collected over one semester.  Eleven participants were trained to use structure maps while solving problems sharing similar deep-structure elements.  The 11 participants were divided into two groups of six and five students each.  Each group met for one hour every week to work on the problems.  We report here on the ways in which students used the structure maps during the interviews, the difficulties faced by students as they attempted to use these maps as well as the feedback offered by students regarding the maps.  We also report on how we changed the maps based on feedback from the students and to facilitate their use during problem solving.

Over the past year we have converted the second semester of our calculus-based introductory physics course course to a Studio Physics format, starting from a traditional lecture-based format.  This process is taking place in two stages.  First, the curriculum was redistributed to fit our part Studio/part lecture course structure.  Second, and based on the results of a variety of assessments, we continue to refine the course on a semester-by-semester basis.  In this poster, we describe the conversion process from traditional to studio format, discuss the PER-based improvements that we have implemented, and identify areas of interest for further study.  We characterize our progress via several metrics, including pre/post Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM) scores, Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) scores, solicited student comments, failure rates, and exam scores.   Initial results are positive:  Despite maintaining course standards, students are less likely to fail and are performing better on certain course tasks.

SM 101, Scientific Thought and Method, was designed to target students interested in majoring in science but who entered college unprepared for the academic rigors of such degrees.  The course integrates explicit scientific reasoning training techniques into the context of multi-disciplinary scientific investigations in an effort to develop those skills deemed necessary for success in future majors courses.  Targeted skills include proportional, probabilistic, correlational, and hypothetico-deductive reasoning as well as identification and control of variables and cohesive scientific arguments.  The course was piloted in Fall 2007 and Spring 2008 to roughly 50 students.  The poster will include specifics about the course, course curriculum, and the results of the study that was implemented to determine the effectiveness of SM 101 at meeting its objectives.  Successes, as well as challenges, will be addressed in terms of how the course will be modified for Fall quarter 2008.  Supported by NSF grant number DUE-0622466.

While the qualitative classification of student responses is often practiced within PER, quantitative methods open up a large set of analysis tools that are unavailable to qualitative methods.  However, since PER data is based on student responses, there are often several difficulties that arise in taking those responses and turning them into quantitative measures.  Using methods and tools from the field of classification (data mining), we look at how the type of question being asked (e.g., multiple choice, free response, ranking task) determines what kind of measurement can appropriately be made and how that in turn effects the mathematics of comparison.  We also examine the extent to which, when using a hierarchical clustering method, the resolution of quantitative ties  responses that are determined to be equidistant to more than one classification category  leads to changes in the final classification.

Students construct their knowledge together as they talk to each other. Thus, many researchers have studied group interaction as a crucial method for learning & teaching. Recently, group interaction has also been emphasized in physics education. Previous studies have revealed diverse types of interactions between groups; however, it is difficult to find the types of dynamic interactions within group. In this study, we tried to investigate the dynamics of students' small group verbal interaction (within group) when they solved mechanics problems. In this study, three students in an upper-level mechanics class participated. Students' group verbal interactions were videotaped and audiotaped, and analyzed. We discovered several types of group interactions within group. We will discuss our findings and educational implications.

The existence of a gender gap in performance on the Force Concept Inventory has been established by several studies.  Those studies have focused on the total score achieved by students on the FCI and subsequent gains in the total score when the instrument is administered again after instruction.  Here we analyze the gender gap for each of the 30 questions in the FCI to determine if particular questions present greater difficulty for females.

Our previous research[1] showed that despite the use of interactive engagement techniques, the gap in performance between males and females on a conceptual learning survey persisted from pre- to posttest, at our institution.  Such findings were counter to previously published work[2].  A follow-up study[3] suggested the gender gap may be more a result of differences in previous physics knowledge than gender.  Current research continues to analyze factors that may influence the observed gender gap in our courses.  We find that there are significant differences (p<0.05) between males and females on several measures of background understanding of math and physics, as well as attitudes about physics.  The posttest data from conceptual assessments are modeled using two regression models (multiple regression and logistic regression) to estimate the gender gap in posttest scores after controlling for these prior factors.  The results indicate that the gender gap exists in interactive physics classes at our institution, but is due in large part to differences in previous physics and math knowledge, and attitudes and beliefs.

Frictional force is a very difficult concept for students to understand; even university students have difficulties in learning friction. We theoretically discussed the importance of inference in understanding dynamics related to friction. Furthermore, we conducted a survey to investigate university students concepts concerning frictional force. By analyzing the result, we found evidence that lack of inference in the reasoning process could create difficulties in problem solving about friction. Our result suggests that the role of inference must be emphasized in the instruction of friction.

The view of science in the education community is shifting from a rhetoric of conclusions to a social process of knowledge construction, and engagement in scientific argumentation is a hallmark of such knowledge construction.  This emphasis on argument recasts the role of evidence and data in scientific classrooms: rather than being used to demonstrate scientific principles, it is the grounds on which claims are warranted. In this poster, I explore a transcript of scientific discourse, exploring the rules by which participants in the discourse endorse or reject scientific claims.  I appeal for a more nuanced understanding of evidence as one of many criteria by which scientific claims are evaluated, and that evidence, at times, is incommensurable with other (possibly more scientific) criteria for evaluating claims.  This view of argumentation, and the peculiar language games associated with argumentation, is particularly relevant for understanding difficulties that diverse student populations may face.

In physics instruction we often present students with an abstract principle, and then illustrate the principle with one or more examples.  We hope that students will use the examples to refine their understanding of the principle and be able to transfer the principle to new situations. However, research in cognitive science has shown that students understanding of a new principle may become bound up with the example(s) used to illustrate it. We report on a study with physics students to see if this specificity effect was present in their reasoning.  The data show that even students who understand and can implement a particular physics principle have a strong tendency to discard that principle when the transfer task appears superficially similar to their training example.  The implications of this effect for transfer and expertise will be discussed.

Students difficulties with conceptual questions about force, velocity, and acceleration have been well documented. However, there has been no single systematic study of student understanding of all paired relations among the concepts of force, velocity and acceleration. For example, a student who believes an object with a net force on it must be moving might not believe an accelerating object must be moving. In this paper, we describe the development of a test to build a more comprehensive picture of student understanding. We also report preliminary data suggesting that there are interesting differences in how students believe force, velocity, and acceleration are related. Specifically there are a higher number of students reporting that force and velocity are directionally related then that acceleration and velocity are directionally related.

This paper will describe how physics courses are taught for Mexican engineering students in a large private university in Mexico with a particular student population and with a different academic structure than American universities. The courses are designed to use Tutorials in Introductory Physics from the University of Washington as the main educational strategy, although some other active-learning methods, for instance Peer Instruction and Context Rich Problems, are used. The assessment of learning is based on the use of standard tests such as the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) and the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM). In some courses the attitudes and expectations of students have been assessed with the Maryland Physics Expectations Survey (MPEX). This report will present results of the implementation and learning of students, and will describe how professors have adopted these strategies.

Anecdotal evidence from the introductory physics classrooms at Chicago State University suggests that our students view collaboration as an important tool in their learning.  Despite this, students often need additional instruction and support for effective collaboration in order to make discussions productive.  In order to aid students in establishing effective collaborations we want to capitalize on the fact that students at CSU readily accept the inquiry approach to instruction.            
In this poster, we present the initial stage of this work.  Specifically, we have begun to video-tape student interactions in the classroom and interview students about the nature of learning.  In addition, we have developed and administered an instrument that gauges the value students place on the use of guided inquiry.   By utilizing a specific criteria and analyzing the occurrence of specific behaviors in the classroom we can determine the effectiveness of collaboration during group work.[2] Responses regarding how students value the use of questions in instruction suggest how peer questioning can be used to promote effective collaboration.

Mathematics can serve many functions in physics.  It can provide a computational system, reflect a physical idea, conveniently encode a rule, and so forth.  A physics student thus has many different options for using mathematics in his physics problem solving.  We present a short example from the problem solving work of upper level physics students and use it to illustrate the epistemic framing process:  framing because these students are focusing on a subset of their total math knowledge, epistemic because their choice of subset relates to what they see (at that particular time) as the nature of the math knowledge in play.  We illustrate how looking for students warrants, the often unspoken reasons they think their evidence supports their mathematical claims, can serve as a window to their epistemic framing.

Several reform curricula (such as the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE)) incorporate design tasks under the assumption that by overcoming the challenges of the assignment, students would not only construct scientific concepts, but they will develop, as well, the abilities necessary to build new knowledge and solve new problems.
What happens when students have to generate their own procedures and conclusions? How do they frame these problems? How do they interact with each other and the material? To explore these issues, we video-recorded several student groups designing and conducting an experiment in an unknown topic and we analyzed these recordings using qualitative techniques.

We became teachers because we want everyone to be able to see through science the elegance in nature as we do. Our instincts and years of training lead us to tell students about science and math as we understand it. Unfortunately research has shown that telling is not always the most effective way to share our understanding.  Approximately 250 interviews have been conducted with simulations developed by the Physics Education Technology (PhET) Project [1]. These interviews have provided a wealth of data about student engagement and learning. Weve conducted interviews using several different levels of guidance and found that the level of guidance influences the amount of student engagement. Minimal but nonzero guidance with many of these simulations creates the optimum engaged exploration and impressive amounts of learning.[2]

In an on-going research study, we present the following task to current and former introductory physics students: given a problem statement and three possible solutions, only one of which is correct, identify the correct solution and the errors in the other solutions.  By investigating how the students make their selection, we seek to address two different research questions.  First, what specific actions do the students use to arrive at their conclusions? Second, how do students use deductive reasoning in their choices and justifications? Preliminary results suggest that students do exhibit beneficial learning behaviors but with varying levels of sophistication.  Additionally, they use a variety of justifications for their selections and do not always ensure that their selection is deductively sound.  In this poster, we will present our preliminary coding scheme and a few notable examples from our pilot study.

I discuss how race and identity have emerged as primary considerations in my research and teaching. This program spans twenty years and has focused on mathematics learning and participation among African American adults and adolescents in school and non-school contexts. While mainstream mathematics education research has conceptualized learning and participation as cognitive and cultural activities, my work pushes these perspectives to consider mathematics learning and participation as racialized forms of experience; that is, as activities structured by the larger relations and discourses of race that exist in the broader society. For many African American learners, African American identity has served as a marker for degradation in mainstream research and policy contexts. Meanwhile, the concept of race has remained undertheorized. One consequence is a widely accepted, yet uncontested, racial hierarchy of mathematical ability that constructs African American learners as mathematically illiterate relative to other learners. My work challenges these constructions.

First among the many important challenges facing American higher education is the need to improve the effectiveness of our educational programs. Public concern has heightened the sense of urgency for colleges and universities to make progress on improving and measuring educational outcomes, which is made more challenging by the varieties of diversity facing us. Students are more diverse than ever, both in terms of their personal characteristics but also in terms of their abilities, preparation, and expectations.

In order to make sense of the increasing varieties of diversity affecting our postsecondary educational efforts this session will draw upon research from a range of local and national efforts in these areas. One example is ongoing research at the University of Michigan that explores the educational implications of implementing a web-based lecture capture system in large lecture courses. Student use of and reactions to such systems is important, as is the potential to influence course performance for students in general, but also for underrepresented and at-risk student subpopulations. In addition to helping bring our current landscape into focus, the session will identify effective practices as well as continuing challenges to improving educational practice for undergraduate students.

A common approach to the teaching of science is to create learning communities around sameness. In such circumstances students who differ from the mainstream are disadvantaged and often are regarded as learning disabled. This paper presents research on the uses of cogenerative dialogue to afford the creation of learning communities in which difference is respected and regarded as a resource for advancing learning of the collective as well as individuals within the collective. I describe what we learned from a five-year longitudinal authentic ethnography in which cogenerative dialogues were used in high schools in the Bronx Borough of New York City to create productive learning environments in which student achievement increased equitably for categories defined by ethnicity, class and native language. The route toward higher achievement was paved by expanded roles for science teachers and students. The ways in which these roles were enacted are described in the paper.

Professional development programs promoting inquiry-based teaching are challenged with providing teachers content knowledge and using pedagogical approaches that model standards based instruction. Inquiry practices are also important for undergraduate students. This talk focuses on the evaluation of an extensive professional development program for chemistry teachers that included chemistry content tests for students and the teachers and the impact of undergraduate research experiences on college students' attitudes towards chemistry. Baseline results for the students showed that there were no gender differences on the achievement test but that white students scored significantly higher than non-white students. However, parent/adult involvement with chemistry homework and projects was a significant negative predictor of 11th grade students' chemistry achievement test score. This talk will focus on students' achievement and attitude results for teachers who are mid-way through the program provide evidence that ongoing, sustained professional development in content and pedagogy is critical for improving students' science achievement.

Despite reports to the contrary, the availability of physics as a course for secondary students is not equitably distributed throughout the U.S. While some schools provide physics access for all, a more common scenario is limited availability to select students. This is particularly true in urban districts, where this study examined access to and availability of high school physics. New York City's secondary schools were surveyed to determine where physics was offered and how many students were enrolled. Statistics were performed to compare differences between physics and non-physics schools. Additionally, organizational factors were examined that relate to physics availability, such as the magnet school configuration, the AP Physics and conceptual physics options, and science curricular sequence. Overall, it was determined that physics availability is limited in NYC schools, a serious inequity that disproportionately affects students of color and poor children. Strategies for improving access and enrollment will be discussed.

This presentation draws on Latina/Latino studies to offer education a potential framework for reconceptualizing "knowledge" and for engaging teacher candidates in a process that acknowledges the complex identities of students and the power relations they negotiate while in school. Specifically, I use Gloria Anzald�a's notion of Nepantla--a liminal space that facilitates transformation. In this presentation, I will describe aspects of a model of teacher education I have developed and offer examples of how teacher candidates move through states of what Anzald�a would call ignorance/distancing versus knowledge/connection with others. Finally, I suggest that our work of preparing teachers must help them not only recognize a state of Nepantla (to see and participate in multiple realities) but also come to expect the uneasiness with being in that space, while celebrating its potential to birth new identities and create new (forbidden) knowledges.

CSU is looking to partner with other institutions to assess how students at diverse institutions view the use of questioning in the classroom.  

Specifically, we would like other institutions to administer a survey we have developed in which students comment on instructional episodes.  We would like partners at:
(1) institutions similar to our own (minority serving, comprehensive) and 
(2) research universities with more traditional populations.

Science safety in is a vital issue in 2008 because: 1) it is tested on many state science content tests, 2) pre-service teachers take the Praxis test which also requires knowledge of safe science practice, 3) teachers are being trained in alternative ways that may omit safe science methods, 4) science content standards in many states emphasize doing science without specific safety guidelines, especially for middle and elementary classrooms and 5) science methods curricula have not always included planning for and conducting experiments safely. National Science Education Standards (NSES) encourage active science learning with best practices promoting inquiry-based and hands-on instruction at all instructional levels. Teachers who teach science are using equipment that may or may not be developmentally appropriate for their students (using open flames in K-2nd grade, for example). Accidents occur and go unreported. Based on a survey of practice in South Dakota schools, a national survey of science teaching practice K-12 is proposed.

Physical Science for Everyday Thinking is a guided inquiry approach to teaching physical science.  Pre and post survey data was collected over two years from two courses using PSET.  The course was taught in an intensive format at a small, private liberal arts college; at least half the students were education majors.  The surveys assessed content knowledge and confidence in the answers, attitudes toward science and understanding of the process of learning science.  Analysis indicated significant increases in content knowledge, confidence in content knowledge and comfort levels with physical science;  also significant changes in identification as a science person, what is a fact, objectivity of scientists and science as a solitary pursuit.  Im interested in discussing why these changes occurred, why other ideas didnt change and what affects a willingness to teach K-8 physical science.

In order to better understand and teach physics, it would be beneficial teachers to understand the teaching structure of an outstanding physicist like Feynman. Feynman is well known for not only being one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century but also for being an excellent physics lecturer. Thus, we tried to analyze and identify the individual and holistic characteristics of The Feynman Lectures on Physics by using the framework of knowledge & belief. The results revealed that diverse knowledge & belief were integrated, and the storyline was well-organized in Feynmans lectures on gravitation. Furthermore, emphasis was placed on open investigation. Further research issues stemming from this result are discussed.

Research in physics education has demonstrated new tools and models for improving the understanding and engagement of traditional college students. [1]  The research community has bridged the gap to pre-college education, even elementary school. [2]  However little work has been done to engage students in out-of-school settings, particularly for those students from populations under-represented in the sciences.  We present a theoretically-grounded model of university-community partnership [3] that engages students and children in a collective enterprise that has the potential to improve the participation and education of all.  We document the impact of these programs on: university participants (undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs in physics) who learn about education, the community and even some science; children in the community who learn about science, the nature of science and develop the identities and attitudes towards science; and, shifts in institutional practice which may allow these programs to be sustained. We conclude by identifying some of the structural barriers to implementing and sustaining these programs.

Tips for Successful Implementation and Conceptual Learning Outcomes

This poster is a companion to the one by Hsu.  In this presentation, we report on a collaborative investigation into ways in which the Physics by Inquiry (PbI) curriculum (by McDermott and the PEG at the University of Washington) can be implemented by utilizing undergraduate peer instructors in large enrollment courses serving student populations other than the one in which it was originally intended. Typically, PbI is implemented in small classes of pre-service teachers with multiple instructors. However, many institutions, including community colleges and primarily undergraduate institutions, have various implementation constraints. We present three models for implementation of the PbI curriculum as responses to our local constraints at the University of Minnesota, Southern Connecticut State University and Baltimore City Community College.  We will also report on conceptual learning outcomes in these courses.

This poster is a companion to the one by Cummings. It focuses on an assessment of student attitudes toward physics and the learning of physics using the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS). In virtually all standard introductory physics courses, students' responses to CLASS questions regress toward less expert-like attitudes or at best, remain largely stable over the time frame of the course. However, in our adapted PbI courses, we observe large, significant shifts toward more expert-like attitudes based on students' responses.

Is there a way to engage typical physics undergraduates in a conversation about under-represented groups in physics that doesn't result in rolled-eyes or fingers-in-the-ears? The Society of Physics Students has begun an experiment using a jeopardy-like game at physics meetings in an attempt to generate conversations about diversity. The physics jeopardy game is part of a "Future Faces of Physics" kit that includes a variety of materials that are of interest to those wanting to address under-represented audiences in physics, such as video clips exhibiting common physics words in sign language, tactile representations of the lunar surface for blind students, guidelines regarding lab procedures for the wheel-chair bound, and the book, "Einstein on Race and Racism" with a challenge letter directed at SPS chapters from the authors. While attempts to assess the impact of the game are modest, we will report anecdotally some of the qualitative features seen in the discussions when the game is played. We will also strive to indulge in a few physics jeopardy game moments during the poster session so that attendees get a sense of how the game works.

After many years of conducting research into student learning of physics and implementing PER-based curricula in all kinds of settings and levels, I decided to spend my sabbatical as a full time science teacher at a public high school in Harlem, New York City. I went with enthusiasm and optimism, confident that my knowledge of student learning of science and my personality would translate to great student achievement. While I feel that I met with some success, in this poster I instead focus on the overwhelming challenges of succeeding in this environment. I will share my perspective of how these challenges are related to race, culture, and expectations (both mine and theirs). In addition, I will share how the focus on high stakes, low level testing drives so much of the instruction and frustration (more mine than theirs).

One of the important skills of teaching is the ability to follow closely the students' conceptual understanding and to respond accordingly with appropriate instruction. This poster is concerned with the design and study of Collaborative Diagnosis of Conceptions (CDC), an instructional strategy aimed at developing pre-service teachers' deep understanding of content and at the same time develop their pedagogic content knowledge about ways to interact in the future with their students' conceptual understanding using a similar instructional strategy. The CDC strategy was tried out and studied in a geometrical optics course with a total of 123 pre-service elementary science teachers from multicultural backgrounds (rural Bedouin communities and multicultural urban communities).

The results of the study show that the pre-service teachers, in particularly the low achieving students, advanced significantly in their understanding of the optical concepts. However, only after we added a meta-cognitive component requiring the pre-service teachers to discuss and explicate, continuously, the pedagogical characteristics of the strategy, they also advanced significantly in their understanding of the pedagogical merit of this strategy.

The PIs have been involved in an NSF-funded project to develop materials for the introductory mechanics laboratory.  The materials are based on the instructional approach taken in Tutorials in Introductory Physics (curriculum developed in the context of the calculus-based course at the University of Washington).  While the materials being developed are intended for the algebra-based course, at many universities the labs are common to the two courses.  As a result, we have been looking at differences in performance between these two student populations.  In this poster, we describe the differences we have observed, especially as related to graphs, proportional reasoning, and algebra.  It turns out that you cannot just change the d's to Deltas--who knew?  We will discuss implications for instructors and for curriculum developers.

Sharing work in PER in other countries can take several forms.  Conferences, workshops, and publications are possibly the most accessible places to start.  Several challenges are often encountered:  language, working conditions, availability of technology, different systems of preparation of teachers, access to the literature of our field.  In spite of the differences in language, many clues as to their thinking about the phenomena present themselves, in particular body language?non-verbal communication.  This poster will illustrate how these challenges have played out in the experience of one PER community member sharing PER in Mexico.

"Self-diagnosis tasks" aim at fostering diagnostic behavior by explicitly requiring students to present diagnosis as part of the activity of reviewing their problem solutions. The recitation classes in an introductory physics class (~200 students) were split into three experimental groups in which different levels of guidance was provided for performing the self-diagnosis activities and a control group. We have been investigating how a) students in each group performed on subsequent near and far transfer questions given as part of the exams; and b) comparing the relation between student's initial scores on their quizzes vs. their performance on the exams, and the relation between student's self-diagnosis scores and their performance on the exams.
We conclude with some hypotheses about the students' ability to self-diagnose that emphasizes the importance of teaching students how to diagnosis their own mistakes.

We will present data from a decade of introductory calculus-based physics courses for science and engineering students at the University of Minnesota taught using cooperative group problem solving. The data include 40 classes with more than 5500 students taught by 23 different professors.  The average normalized gain for males is 0.4 for these large classes that emphasized problem solving. Female students made up approximately 20% of these classes. We present relationships between pre and post FCI scores, course grades, and student background factors for females and males.  Examples of background factors include major, high school physics, and math preparation. We will compare our results with previous studies from Harvard [1] and the University of Colorado [2].  Our data show there is a significant gender gap in pre-test FCI scores that persists post-instruction although there is essentially no gender difference in course performance as determined by course grade.

We investigated the effect of physics education research-based teaching methods on the gender gap in conceptual understanding in introductory physics. We analyzed data from the introductory calculus-based mechanics course for non-majors at Harvard University taught traditionally and taught with different degrees of interactive engagement. On average, female students have lower Force Concept Inventory (FCI) pretest scores than males. Teaching with Peer Instruction not only yields significantly greater FCI posttest scores for both males and females but also reduces the FCI posttest gender gap. Teaching with several interactive components (Peer Instruction, Tutorials in Introductory Physics, and Just-in-Time Teaching) eliminates the FCI posttest gender gap, and no gender disparity exists in grades, in spite of females' lower FCI pretest scores. We also analyzed data from the algebra-based mechanics course; although the gender gap reduction is not as pronounced as in the calculus-based course, interactive teaching also reduces the gender gap.

This poster will describe the iterative process of the development of curriculum that focuses on helping students develop scientific abilities while constructing physics knowledge. The central idea of the curriculum is formative assessment and self-assessment, which were found to be the most powerful interventions to improve student learning. Formative assessment, done through specially designed rubrics, not only provides feedback to the students but most importantly provides feedback to instructors. Rubrics used for research purposes allow us to document student progress, their difficulties, and to subsequently revise curriculum materials. We will provide the details of the curriculum development and examples of student work that show how their learning changes from year to year as we improve the materials.

We will give priority to issues relating to the teaching and learning of physics, and our recommendations will center on practical advice for physics educators and education researchers.

Participation and success rates of black students at universities in South Africa are still very low compared to their white counterparts, particularly in mathematics and science, due to general economic disadvantage and a lack of qualified teachers and resources at high schools. The General Entry to Programmes in Science (GEPS) at the University of Cape Town is designed to increase the number of black students enrolling for a science degree and maximize their chances of graduating. Students in this program spend an extra year during which they participate in a number of "intensive" science courses including physics. The physics course is designed around three areas: "in context" mathematical techniques, problem-solving laboratories, and scientific writing skills. The physics course covers half of the material that is covered in the regular physics course after which students complete the remaining material in their second year at a similar pace to the regular students.

Students entering the special access course in physics at the University of Cape Town generally do not speak English as first language and have experienced poor science teaching. As a consequence they experience a range of difficulties in a number of areas related to learning physics. We discuss research carried out in two such areas (a) understanding of measurement and (b) engagement with the textbook. With regard to (a), an overview of the methodology, analysis framework and findings of previous work will be presented together with more recent preliminary findings regarding audience dependence when conveying measurement results. With regard to (b), the idea of writing chapter summaries was used to guide students through the book with the aim that the textbook would come to be valued as an accessible resource. Findings from the analysis of the student summaries and their attitudes toward summary writing will be presented.

Student content knowledge and general reasoning abilities are two important areas in education practice and research. In this paper, we report one study of a systematic research to investigate the possible interactions between students' learning of physics content knowledge and the development of general scientific reasoning abilities. Specifically, this study seeks to answer the research question of whether and to what extent content learning may affect the development of general reasoning abilities. College entrance testing data of freshman college students in both USA and China were collected using three standardized tests, FCI, BEMA, and Lawson's Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning (Lawson Test). The results suggest that years of rigorous training of physics knowledge in middle and high schools have made significant impact on Chinese students' ability in solving physics problems, while such training doesn't seem to have direct effects on their general ability in scientific reasoning, which was measured to be at the same level as that of the students in USA.

This study of 110 minority physicists is based on four years of data collection (2004-2008) with the National Society of Black Physicists and the National Society of Hispanic Physicists. Through individual interviews and focus groups the research team sought to understand the academic, social and racial experiences of the participants. The primary purpose was to understand the nature of their interactions with faculty and peers inside and outside of the classroom, their experiences in physics programs, their racial experiences and the extent to which they were motivated by race to succeed as a scientist. In this poster session I report findings on the "proving process" and students' experiences with faculty in the classroom.

Students in introductory physics courses are expected to learn physics content through the process of solving problems.  In an interview study with six university physics faculty, we have identified an important conflict in the way that they view problem solving in the context of an introductory course.  Three important findings will be described in this poster: 1) physics instructors believe that student learning in a physics course primarily occurs when students generalize and refine their physics knowledge by reflectively solving physics problems; 2) physics instructors realize that most students do not possess the skills necessary to engage in reflective problem solving when they enter an introductory physics course; and 3) physics instructors do not expect and do not intervene to make students improve their reflective problem solving skills during the introductory physics course.  Suggestions will be made for how to help instructors resolve the conflict represented on one hand by their (correct) assessment that students do not have the skills necessary to engage in the primary learning activity of the course and on the other hand by their pessimistic estimation of students' ability to improve in these very skills.

We have used PER-based course materials to teach various physics topics to Tibetan Buddhist monks over the last four years.  While listening to the monks' ideas through interpreters, we found some striking similarities with ideas that we hear in our own classrooms in the US.  However, the degree of similarity of monks' ideas with those of US students varied with the topic.  For example, ideas that emerged in the topic of magnetism were often consistent with western ideas while ideas about color addition were sometimes strikingly different from ideas that American students use.  The monks' ways of talking lead us to believe that cultural background partially determines how they think initially about particular physics topics.  This poster will give examples of similarities and of differences, and attempt to identify reasons for both.

Many novice physics students studying mechanics, particularly those at risk for poor performance, do not attend to the physical principles behind the particular equations they use to solve problems.  This leads to the well-known novice behavior of preoccupation with the surface features of a problem rather than the cueing on deep conceptual structure exhibited by experts.  A small subset (N=50) of students pre-identified to be at risk for failing an introductory calculus-based physics class (N~1100) participated in a concurrent supplemental course designed to promote conceptual awareness and use in solving problems. The supplement requires students to explicitly identify the operative physical principle needed to solve the problem, provide a short justification explaining what features of the problem imply the principle is applicable, create a written procedure for solving the problem using said principle, and finally generate a fully worked solution with written explanations of each step.  We will discuss performance in: a) a problem categorization task involving sorting problems by operative physical principle and b) examinations in the introductory course.

We previously showed [1] that despite teaching with interactive engagement techniques, the gap in performance between males and females on conceptual learning surveys persisted from pre- to posttest, at our institution.  Such findings were counter to previously published work [2].  Subsequent work [3] suggested the gender gap may be attributable to differences in physics background. Our current work analyzes factors that may influence the observed gender gap in our courses.  We find that there are significant differences (p<0.05) between males and females on several measures of math and physics preparation, as well as attitudes about physics. Posttest conceptual assessment data are modeled using both multiple regression and logistic regression to estimate the gender gap in posttest scores after controlling for these prior factors. We find that at our institution the gender gap persists in interactive physics classes, but is largely due to differences in physics and math preparation and attitudes.

We are accustomed to talking and thinking about diversity issues in terms of the ism's such as racism, sexism, and classism.  The -ism lens, which focuses our attention on those who are oppressed, obscures a broader understanding.  Oppression can not exist without privilege.  When one group is denied opportunity, there is necessarily another which is advantaged.  Through the lens of privilege our focus is turned to those who benefit.  This new lens allows for new understandings.  In this interactive poster we will explore the concept of privilege.

In 2004 Florida International University (FIU) began a physics education reform effort by implementing Modeling Instruction in university physics classes and holding Modeling Workshops for high school teachers as a way to increase participation in physics by underrepresented students.  By working at multiple levels, across high school and university, Modeling has become a common theme and has helped to establish a vibrant research and learning community.  The primary and secondary effects of Modeling Instruction within FIU (improved intro physics experience and participation in a learning community) have spurred greater participation in physics and increased persistence.  In this poster, we present the implementation of Modeling Instruction and discuss the impacts on the diverse population of students at FIU.

Physics education research has shown that learning environments that engage students and allow them to take an active part in their learning can lead to large conceptual gains compared to traditional instruction.  Although curricular materials and real-time data collection tools developed by the Activity-based Physics group have been used all over the world there was some question whether such materials would be useful to teachers in Bangalore who teach the very poorest children. The Parikrma Foundation runs four schools near four of Bangalore?s worse slums and serves more than 800 children. The science teachers from the schools attended a two-week activity-based workshop where they used real-time data collection and explored multiple curricula. Interactive Lecture Demonstrations (ILDs) using real-time data logging were emphasized since they would be teaching in a one-computer classroom. This poster describes the workshop experience.

Physics Education Researchers have provided instructors with (1) tools to assess student learning, (2) details on the state of student knowledge, and (3) instructional materials and learning environments that have proven to be effective in promoting understanding.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of this work has centered on students and instruction at the traditional research university. As instructors begin to implement innovative instructional materials, and as researchers begin to investigate student learning with diverse populations, complex differences emerge.  The use of traditional PER tools in non-traditional environments, such as the urban, comprehensive university, often leads to a very narrow picture of student development.  Often, this limited view highlights deficiencies in learning and fails to reveal the strengths and resources of this population.  In this poster we highlight some of the resources we have found with the population of students at urban institutions in Chicago.  In addition, we describe how these resources have guided the implementation of a specific type of instructional approach.

Physics education research has traditionally not addressed variation in student population. Are the tools, practices, and findings of PER relevant, applicable and valid across populations? This session includes four PER groups working with underrepresented student populations differing by audience, method and implementation. Brewe, Kramer and OBrien at Florida International University, a Hispanic-Serving Institution, use reform to develop community; Sabella, Coble and Bowen of Chicago State University, a Black-Serving Institution, apply PER methods to identify underrepresented university students' resources; Finkelstein and Mayhew of the University of Colorado investigate impacts and institutional implications of informal education programs; Steinberg of City College of New York implements PER-based approaches as a science teacher at a mixed public high school in Harlem. These researchers are united by the goal of identifying problems within the structures of physics/science education relevant to encouraging student successes. These posters identify a diversity of approaches to improving educational opportunities for underrepresented student groups and limitations, challenges and opportunities for broadening inclusion.

Physics Instructors believe many students enter their classes lacking the learning skills required to perform well in the introductory physics course. Yet traditional university teaching typically does not attempt to develop students' learning skills required to benefit from the physics course. 
An essential skill mentioned frequently is reflection in problem solving while carrying out a paper pencil task or while performing an experiment.  Reflection upon the problem solving process in both types of tasks could include  evaluating one's own solution, self-diagnosing former steps while elaborating the understanding of the physics involved in the problem, as well as the perception that such behavior is constructive.  How do students entering the introductory physics classroom differ in their reflection in problem solving? To what extent does this distribution of skill predict students' ability to learn the material taught in the course? Does this skill improve as the students progress through  traditional university courses which  typically do not attempt to develop students' learning skills? How can we modify instruction to help develop these learning skills in students who need it while also benefiting the students who already possess these learning skills? 

The posters in the session will shed light on diverse aspects of the subject as follows: (1) the connection between learning skills and the achievements of the students in class, (2)  instructors' approaches regarding the development of these skills, (3) students' epistemic stance regarding learning from problem solving both while performing paper pencil tasks and performing experiments, and (4) possible interventions aimed to help students reflect upon the problem solving process in different situations.

An issue of widespread concern among physicists is the low representation of women and certain ethnic minorities in physics. As PER seeks to improve physics learning for all, we must ask whether PER-based instructional methods can also help ameliorate (or at least not aggravate) the underrepresentation of these groups. This poster session will facilitate a forward-looking discussion of how PER-based instruction can best foster the success of these groups by bringing together insights from work in three areas: (1) evaluating the success of underrepresented students with PER-based methods, (2) identifying barriers to these students' success in ordinary instructional environments, and (3) existing programs (not necessarily PER-based) aimed at improving the retention and learning of these underrepresented groups. After work in these three areas is presented and discussed, all attendees will participate in brainstorming future work that will identify strengths and weaknesses in the current PER-based methods, with the ultimate goal of developing improved instructional methods.

It is not obvious to what extent PER findings with English-speaking students apply to students from other cultures in other parts of the world and vice versa.

Considerable research and curriculum development has focused on students learning of force and motion concepts, yet research shows that many students fail to gain Newtonian-based understanding of force and motion concepts.  Researchers have demonstrated the connection between learning in physics and students personal epistemologies.  Yet this research has typically used time intensive qualitative methods or Likert scale surveys which can result in loss of meaning.  Thus this study used Q methodology, a sophisticated technique for determining the various perspectives on a topic by correlating people with similar views.  Four distinct perspectives about learning physics concepts in a first semester physics classroom were revealed with Q.  One of these four perspectives was positively correlated with the posttest scores on the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE) while the remaining perspectives were negatively correlated with the FMCE posttest scores.  Implications of these results will be presented.

Identification of student conceptions is one of the main topics for both qualitative and quantitative paradigms in physics and science education research. There are invaluable studies in literature based on both of these paradigms, and all provide us with important information about how students conceptualize nature. However, both paradigms have advantages as well as limitations compared to one another. In this study, a need for a cross paradigm to diagnose student conceptions will be discussed, and an example of a cross paradigm method to diagnose conceptions will be proposed.

Several studies in physics and science education research have revealed that students have difficulty in understanding some introductory light and optics concepts. Nowadays, more emphasis is given to using appropriate methodologies to eliminate these difficulties, and to understanding the nature of acquisition of scientific conceptions fully. However, in addition to identification of these difficulties in students minds, the possible sources of these difficulties should be determined and eliminated. Students experiences, textbooks, language used, teachers can be listed among several possible sources of students unscientific conceptions in physics. In the present study examples of these possible sources will be provided with related unscientific conception from light and optics.

We examine the impact of teaching environment and preparation on the conceptions of teaching and learning expressed by our graduate Teaching Assistants (TAs) and undergraduate Learning Assistants (LAs). Since these instructors spend the most time directly interacting with introductory physics students, their beliefs regarding the nature of instruction may play a critical role in the success of reformed teaching methods. In this study, we examine our instructors beliefs through post-semester interviews in which they describe their self-perceived role in the classroom and comment on two different videos of TAs interacting with students. Comparisons are then made between TAs and LAs, and across teaching environments. As part of this study, we also seek to understand where changes in pedagogical conceptions and attitudes originate, in order to improve our overall method of preparing physics instructors.

Models are important elements to explain scientific ideas. Physics makes explanations about nature with different type of models. In educational context, Modeling is an instructional methodology which students being physically and mentally active. Modeling cycle aims students construction of mathematical model(s) of a given physical situation by analyzing, discussing, exploring and experimenting with cooperative learning groups. Including different type of active learning activities makes modeling is an effective instructional methodology in learning of physics at different levels- high school and university levels (Wells, Hestenes, & Swackhamer, 1995). This study explains a model of modeling cycle for a physics concept in terms of active learning elements. The roles of students and teacher in a lesson are mentioned in detail. Richness of this methodology with active learning elements provides teachers and instructors active and effective learning environments.

We report on an NSF sponsored intervention, Thinking in Physics (TIP), which we have developed to help students with weak scientific reasoning skills, as measured by low preinstruction scores on the Lawson Test of Scientific Reasoning Ability.   Without such special help, such students are unlikely to achieve a good conceptual understanding of introductory mechanics.

In an ongoing investigation of student understanding of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics concepts in the upper division, we have uncovered several student difficulties with the topic of entropy. Based on the results of our research we have developed and implemented a three-tutorial sequence designed to guide students to develop a robust understanding of entropy and its applications. We present the rationale behind, and the design intent of, the third tutorial in this sequence, dealing primarily with entropy considerations of heat engines. We also present pre- and post-instruction data from the first implementation of this tutorial showing evidence of its effectiveness at improving student understanding.

PER has shown the benefit of transitioning teachers from a "sage on the stage" to a "guide on the side".  The e-Book will enable a similar shift in the role of the textbook[1] from authoritative serial repository to a modular, searchable and customizable hub that provides a clear overview of the domain, short summaries of key content, and links to more detailed resources.  Our Wiki will incorporate these features naturally, and allow for student feedback.  Our open-source wiki for introductory mechanics uses ideas from modeling physics to encourage strategic, concept-based problem solving.  This resource can serve as a customizable supplement to any existing course using any mechanics text.  We invite collaborators to help us reinvent the textbook!

Matter and Interactions (M&I) is an introductory physics course that ventures beyond pedagogical innovation by altering course content and emphasis, thus defining new learning goals.  For example, one of the central learning goals of M&I emphasizes the construction of models of physical systems starting from fundamental principles.  It follows that new learning goals necessitate new assessments.  In this paper we present a rubric developed to inform the design of test problems and assess not only content knowledge but also students approach to problem solving.  In addition, we present research findings that informed the development of our rubric includingthe scaffolding of student learning of the new approach to problem solving.  Although our focus is on assessment of the M&I curriculum, our work has implications for assessment design in general.

We are currently working to categorize middle and high school teachers views on students, knowledge construction, group interactions, and assessment.  This poster will compare the views of teachers who were formerly involved in the Learning Assistant (LA) program to a similar group of teachers who did not participate in this program.  This analysis will allow us to reflect on the effects that this program has had on its graduates teaching. The LA Program is intended to recruit promising science and math majors to become secondary science and math teachers.  LAs are hired to assist in science and math courses at the university and are required to take an education seminar focused on teaching methods. Previous work has already shown that the LA program has improved the learning of students in the introductory science and math courses and has increased the number of science and math majors earning teacher certifications.

For several years, our research group at Kansas State has been studying how students apply knowledge in new contexts.  One such study focuses on how students apply knowledge of light and basic geometric optics to the context of wavefront aberrometry.  In one aspect of this study we compared the application of previous knowledge of students who had studied light and basic geometric optics in a physics course with those who had not and thus could only apply knowledge obtained in an informal way.  We sought to examine what differences exist in the way they construct an understanding of wavefront aberrometry.  The data showed that students with no formal instruction tended to rely on experiential knowledge as one would expect.  However, the students with formal instruction relied on textbook knowledge and tended to discount or ignore their everyday experiences.  We will discuss what this difference in knowledge types might imply about the knowledge construction process

In our project we attempted to find out whether students whose beliefs about physics are more expert-like and less expert-like, as judged by the CLASS survey, are different in terms of their approaches to learning physics and whether their behaviors in the classroom are consistent with their responses to the surveys. All students, enrolled in the second semester of an introductory course, took the CLASS survey. We used survey results to identify expert-like and non-expert like students to participate in the study. We selected 4 highest scoring and 4 lowest scoring students. We then observed those students in laboratories and recitations during the whole semester and interviewed them at the end of the semester. We found some inconsistencies between students responses to the survey and their actual behaviors as well as several significant differences in behaviors of more expert-like and less expert-like students.

Schwartz, Bransford and Sears [1] propose a two-dimensional model that describes transfer in terms of efficiency and innovation.  Efficiency is the ability to apply prior knowledge to new situations quickly and accurately.  Innovation is the ability to question assumptions, let go of prior knowledge and generate new ideas.  Schwartz et. al. argue that most educational assessments focus on efficiency at the expense of innovation.  We suggest that this perspective does not adequately reflect the challenges that our students face while problem solving.  For instance, while faculty may find end-of-chapter physics problems to be routine and overly focused on efficiency, our students, who lack prior knowledge and experience may find these problems to be novel and innovative.  We propose an operational meaning of efficiency and innovation and development of criteria to measure these constructs in ways that reflect both students challenges as well as faculty expectations.

Interdisciplinary knowledge is becoming increasingly important in a world where scientists, politicians, and the general public are expected to make informed and reasoned decisions about unpredictable phenomena ranging from global climate change to economic bubbles. The ability to reason about complex and non-intuitive systems is a fundamental objective of higher education learning, and necessary for the development of scientific literacy. We argue that interdisciplinary communication is a necessary prerequisite for the effective communication of scientific principles to non-scientists. While evident in traditional sciences, communication between disciplines is less common in the learning and cognitive science domains. We present: 1) an analysis of boundary crossing as represented in disciplinary science education, science education, and cognitive science journals; 2) a discussion of limitations to communication imposed by traditional venues; and 3) solutions offered by familiar technologies and trends in online publication.

In order to help introductory physics students understand and learn to solve problems with circuits, we must first understand how they differ from experts. This preliminary study focuses on problem solving dealing with electrical circuits. We investigate difficulties novices have with circuits and compare their work with those of experts.  We incorporate the use of an eye-tracker to investigate any possible differences or similarities on how experts and novices focus on graphics or multimedia usually used in analyzing circuits and their components.  Our results show similarities in gaze patterns among all subjects on the components of the circuit.  Yet, we found differences in how they solve the problems. For example, experts simplified circuits when appropriate as opposed to novices who did not.  We also found that novices were confusing additive properties of capacitance with those of resistance.   They also had difficulties identifying when resistors are in parallel or in series.

Cummings et al.[1] developed a survey related to attitudes towards problem solving partially based upon the Maryland Physics Expectations Survey (MPEX)[2].  We expand upon this survey to include questions related to students' approaches to problem solving and examine how students in the introductory courses, graduate students and physics faculty compare with each other.  Graduate students answered the survey questions twice: once about problem solving in the graduate courses and second time about solving introductory physics problems.
Results will be discussed. Supported by NSF.

As a follow-up to a study comparing learning of Newton's Third Law when using three different forms of tutorial instruction [1], we have compared student learning of Newton's Second Law (NSL) when students use the Tutorials in Introductory Physics [2], Activity-Based Tutorials [3], or Open Source Tutorials [4]. We split an algebra-based, life sciences physics course into 3 groups and measured students' pre- and post-instruction scores on the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE) [5]. We look at only the NSL-related clusters of questions on the FMCE [6] to compare students performance and normalized gains. Students entering the course are not significantly different, and students using the Tutorials in Introductory Physics show the largest normalized gains in answering questions on the FMCE correctly. These gains are significant in only one cluster of questions, the Force Sled cluster.

Often computer simulation environments present students with an idealized version of the real world which can affect students conceptual understanding.  Here we investigate the effects of completing an experiment in mechanics using this ideal world as compared to an identical experiment in the real world.  Students in three of five conceptual physics laboratory sections completed the hands-on experiment while the other two sections performed the experiment virtually. Each section performed a pulley experiment. The experiments were conducted in the context of a unit on simple machines from the CoMPASS curriculum which integrates hypertext based concept maps in a design-based context.  We will present at data from pre-, mid- and post-tests and written responses on worksheets completed by the students during the activities.

The analysis of Pre/Post test data suggests more gains on research methodologies and skills than actual physical concepts underling the research project.

As part of our continuing research on the teaching and learning of concepts in upper-division thermal physics at the University of Maine, we report on student responses to questions about binomial distributions and the changes in those distributions with an increasing number of trials (N).  We have administered questions before and after traditional instruction and guided-inquiry activities that probe understanding of multiplicities, probabilities, and their distributions over N, covering more than 6 orders of magnitude in N.  Preliminary results indicate some positive learning outcomes, along with some persistent problems; e.g., confusion over the dependence of macrostate probability on multiplicity, and whether the probability of a single (N/2) macrostate emerges at large N to dominate the distribution, or not.  Results are discussed in the context of the term overwhelming probability, commonly used to describe the connections with equilibrium thermodynamic (very large N) systems.

Conceptual learning has long been a primary component of introductory physics education. However, educators agree that problem solving is equally important. Building on our conceptually-based clicker methodology, we conducted pilot studies to seek possible ways of promoting student problem solving skills through guided conceptual scaffolding. We created several question sequences, each consisting of two relevant conceptual questions plus one quantitative problem. Both questions and the problem synthesized concepts widely separated in the textbook. Synthesizing concepts is particularly difficult for students, and generally is not required for solving end-of-chapter problems. Participating students were divided into three groups: the first answered the conceptual questions before being asked to solve the problem.  The second received cueing on underlying concepts before attempting the problem.  The third was simply asked to solve the problem. Small-scale interviews and a large-scale written test were conducted. We report pilot results and discuss future work.

Traditional introductory physics laboratories serve as validation of material presented in lectures; however, reformed laboratory activities stress the active construction of understanding through a student's lab experience.  Our reformed labs, informed by Modeling Instruction, are adapted to our lecture course, which covers algebra-based content motivated by biological applications. Our question probes student buy-in: How are students approaching knowledge construction in reformed lab activities?  We videotape groups of students as they work through our reformed lab activities.  We then interview members of the video taped lab groups individually, seeking deeper insight into selected clips from their in-lab videos. The videos are transcribed and then coded, using a semi-open coding.  This coding is guided by the framework of epistemic resources.  Codes are validated through comparison within individual's interviews and across interviewees with respect to written materials.  We will present key aspects of our methodology and initial descriptions of individual student epistemologies.

Helping pre-service teachers develop physics knowledge that is useful in the tasks of teaching is a growing responsibility of physics education researchers. Prior research has documented that analyzing video of children learning science aids pre-service teachers in developing their physics knowledge and deepens their understanding of the learning process. Research on video analysis in teacher education suggests that the primary value of such tasks comes not from watching the video, but from the subsequent discussions. We questioned whether similar advantages would be evident when participants watched and analyzed video clips via online threaded discussions. We found that participants used the video clips as a mediating tool to position their own current ideas about physics topics with respect to their prior understandings as well as to ideas articulated by the students in the video clips. We discuss the study findings and affordances and limitations of online discussion formats.

Development of students problem-solving ability is commonly cited as one of the primary goals in introductory physics courses. However, there is no broadly agreed upon definition of what is meant by problem solving.  Most physicists want students to be able to successfully apply a logically yet flexible approach to solving real-world problems significantly different from any they have seen before. Still, many introductory instructors are primarily concerned with how successfully and thoughtfully students solve standard textbook-style problems. In this poster, we will present our progress on the development of a multiple-choice survey, the function of which is to reasonably characterize the problem-solving ability of introductory, undergraduate physics students in the realms of dynamics, energy, and momentum. Specifically, we will discuss our particular motivations and goals for this project, share some specific examples of items we have developed, and invite interested faculty to participate in the testing of our instrument.

One attribute of physics experts is that they learn from their own mistakes while solving physics problems.  Experts are unlikely to make the same mistakes when asked to solve a problem a second time especially if they had access to the correct solution after their initial unsuccessful attempt. Here, we discuss a case study which explores if advanced physics students use the opportunity to learn from their mistakes.  The performance on the final exam shows a wide distribution of students' performance on problems administered a second time, which suggests that many advanced students may not automatically exploit their mistakes as an opportunity for learning, and repairing, extending, and organizing their knowledge structure. We also conduct individual interviews with a subset of students to obtain a better insight into students' attitude towards problem-solving and learning and to understand how well students are able to retrieve knowledge relevant for solving the problems.

The teaching/learning interview has been used to investigate student learning.  The aim of the teaching/learning interview is to model a natural learning environment while allowing more direct access to a students or groups thinking and reasoning.  The interview typically involves one to four students working with a researcher/interviewer while being audio and video recorded.  It has previously been reported [1] that the data collected in a teaching/learning interview is richer in detail than data collected in an actual classroom.  We investigated the possibility that there were also other differences between these formats.  We used the same instructional materials as well as pre-, mid- and post-tests in a teaching/learning interview and in a classroom laboratory setting.  We will describe how the data collected in these two settings compare.

Peer Instruction is an interactive pedagogical method that has shown positive effects on students conceptual understanding of subject matter as well as problem solving skills. The purpose of the current study is to present a systematic review of the literature relating to Peer Instruction. We searched databases, journals and other relevant data sources from 1991 to 2009. Selection criteria included physics education and peer instruction. The study reports the number of studies found, the types of experiments done, and the effects of each study. The results of the review present a strong evidence base to the effectiveness of the Peer Instruction method. The study will be extended in the future to include other subject matter. This study is the first to conduct a comprehensive systematic review of the published literature of the Peer Instruction method.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between the gender composition of a laboratory group and student behaviors, self-efficacy, and quiz performance, within the college physics laboratory. A student population was chosen and subdivided into two groups, which were assigned either same-sex or coed laboratory teams while executing identical laboratory activities and instruction. Assessments were carried out prior to instruction, during the course, and at the end of one semester worth of instruction and laboratory activities. Students were assessed in three areas: behaviors exhibited during laboratory activities, self-efficacy, and scores on laboratory quizzes. Analyses considered the differences in outcomes after a single semester of physics laboratories that differed only in team gender organization.

In an analysis of the individual behaviors data, it was noted that there is present a practical difference in the individual behaviors exhibited by males and females. This difference implies a difference in how males and females successfully engage in the lab activities.

Calls for change in STEM education have been made for over a decade. Yet change is hard to initiate, and difficult to sustain. In order to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that facilitate change in instruction in higher education, we surveyed existing literature that describes reform in STEM education. Through examining the strategies that researchers adopted, two dimensions of change strategies emerged: 1) change strategies either seek to impact individuals or the environments and structures; 2) the intended change outcome is either prescribed or emergent. With the aid of extra coding categories, we were able to better study the differences and similarities of the approaches adopted by researchers in three different fields: STEM education, higher education, and faculty development. In this talk we will present some of the results and discuss some implications for how to effectively promote change in STEM education.

The mathematical operation of two-dimensional vector addition arises in multiple physics contexts.  The vectors are presented with different features (axes, grids, etc.) depending on the values and physical contexts. As part of a larger survey developed by Van Deventer in 2007, we asked four two-dimensional vector addition questions, with different contextual features, in both a math and a physics context.  Consistent with the previous results of Meltzer and Nguyen (2003) we find that changing the graphical presentation of vectors may affect the methods students use to add vectors. We also conducted interviews consisting of two sets of five different two-dimensional vector addition questions with a distracter task between sets.  We expected that during the interviews students would change methods of vector addition based on the presentation of the vectors.  However, students used the method they used on the first representation, right or wrong, for all following representations.

Studies indicate that the use of multiple representations in teaching helps students become better problem solvers.  Students who learn in representation-rich environments are able to construct representations to help them solve problems.  We report on a study to investigate students difficulties with multiple representations and strategies to help students overcome those difficulties.  We conducted teaching/learning interviews with 20 students in a first semester calculus-based physics course.  Each student was interviewed four times during the semester, each time after they had completed an exam in class.  During these interviews students were first asked to solve a problem they had seen on the exam, followed by problems that differed in context and type of representation from the exam problem.  Students were provided verbal scaffolding to solve the new problems.  We present the interview protocols, common difficulties that students encountered and scaffolding that we provided students to help them overcome those difficulties.

At our school, there is a strong consensus among faculty on how to teach junior-level E&M. In particular, faculty agree that E&M should be taught on an axiomatic basis (Maxwells equations) and they agree on the essential concepts in the course (fields and potentials). In contrast, we find a range of opinions about how to teach first-semester, junior-level quantum mechanics (QM). We surveyed over 15 faculty about their approaches to teaching QM, and reviewed several popular textbooks. Although there is broad agreement on the list and order of topics (Schrodinger equation to matrix methods and spin), we find substantial disagreement in several pedagogical aspects, including (1) the importance of presenting QM on an axiomatic basis (i.e. the postulates);  (2) the treatment of measurement in QM (in particular, the collapse of the wave function); and (3) the physical interpretation of the wave function (matter wave vs. information wave vs. something else).

Our physics instruction for under-prepared engineering students often incorporates worked examples.  We are therefore interested in how students process a worked example in order to learn from it.  We used an eye tracker to record the eye movements of 43 introductory physics students as they read worked examples to aid them in solving difficult physics problems. Our examples are presented in a two-column format with symbolic manipulations and corresponding text explanations in adjacent columns.  Two experimental conditions are employed:  In one condition students were shown a specific target problem followed by worked examples to help them solve it; in the other they were told a problem to solve would follow some preparatory worked examples.  Both global trends and effects of the task will be presented.

Tutorial students learn how to "do tutorial" primarily from the explicit and implicit messages that they get from their TAs.  These messages are most clearly evident in the first few weeks of the semester, as students and TAs negotiate their expectations regarding what kinds of answers are acceptable, who leads the conversation, and what the TA's and students' roles are during their conversations. We present a case study of a TA's interaction with a group of students during the first three weeks of the semester as they "set the tone" by communicating and negotiating their expectations.

Proximal goal setting has been strongly linked to self-efficacy and often occurs in successful problem solving. A qualitative study, using both observations and interviews, investigated the problem-solving processes and the self-efficacy of two students enrolled in an introductory physics course that implemented Modeling Instruction at Florida International University. We found that the problem solving process could be divided into two main themes: the goal setting process and the self-efficacy feedback loop. Further, the goal setting process could not be isolated from its impact on the self-efficacy of the students. This relationship between the goal setting strategies within the problem-solving process and self-efficacy may be linked to the retention of students in physics. We present results of the study and its possible link to student retention.

Out of field teaching, when teachers are assigned to teach subjects that do not match their training or education, is an issue across the country but is especially prevalent in subjects such as physics.  Yet even for those with undergraduate course work in physics, they may not possess Newtonian conceptual understanding of force and motion, especially if they experienced traditional physics courses.  Thus, effective professional development is necessary to correct conceptual understanding in our science teachers to prevent perpetuating these misunderstandings.  This presentation investigates the effects of a one week workshop for in-service teachers on the teachers conceptual understanding of force and motion using the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation as the pretest and posttest. Teacher feedback was also used to gauge the effectiveness of the workshop, including improving the teachers classroom strategies for teaching force and motion.

Modeling instruction has been successfully implemented in colleges and high schools in the United States. In this work a preliminary implementation of modeling instruction in an introductory physics course of Mechanics in a Mexican university is analyzed. The Lawsons Test of Formal Reasoning and the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) were applied in the beginning of the semester, while the FCI was administered again at the end of the period in order to assess the concept learning of students. The students in modeling courses gained the double of concept learning than students in traditional courses. A stepwise correlational study was established between scientific reasoning, initial concepts and concept learning. The concept learning gain just exhibited correlation with the scientific reasoning, R = .454 (p < .001) for modeling instruction and R = .319 (p < .001) for traditional instruction, which proves to be one of the reasons for the observed difference in the concept learning gain.

This paper presents results of an NSF project in which the goal is to provide a synthesis of research on instructional innovations that have been implemented in undergraduate courses in physics. The research questions guiding the project are: What constitutes the range of principal course innovations that are being implemented in undergraduate science courses?  To what extent are different course innovation approaches associated with differences in student learning? What issues are critical to the effective implementation of course innovations? The paper will describe: (1) the procedures followed to analyze the studies described in 118 journal articles, (2) the literature search procedures, (3) the characteristics of the studies reported, and (4) the results from synthesizing the quantitative results of those studies that met our criteria for inclusion. The paper concludes with recommendations for strengthening programs of research that focus on evaluating the effectiveness of instructional innovations in physics.

Like many science and engineering programs, the Colorado School of Mines physics department is interested in improving its gender balance.  In this poster, we present preliminary results from our studies of the gender-based performance gaps that exist in our introductory physics population.  We analyze eight semesters of data from the second-semester calculus-based course, Introduction to Electromagnetism.  Four semesters came from a semi-traditional classroom environment, and four semesters followed a transition to a hybrid Studio physics model (total N = 2577).  Our data include CSEM results, DFW rates, course grades, and background information such as ACT scores.  As has been found in other environments, gender gaps exist but are reduced as we implement research-based course reforms, with the most persistent gaps residing in the CSEM normalized gains.  We also find striking semester-to-semester variations in all measures, despite the same instructors handling the courses for much of the study period.

We describe our initial efforts at implementing social network analysis to visualize and quantify student interactions in Florida International Universitys Physics Learning Center. Developing a sense of community among students is one of the three pillars of an overall reform effort to increase participation in physics, and the sciences more broadly, at FIU. Our implementation of a research and learning community, embedded within a course reform, has led to increased recruitment and retention of physics majors. Finn and Rock [1997] link the academic and social integration of students to increased rates of retention. To identify these social interactions, we have initiated an investigation that utilizes network diagrams to identify primary community participants. Community interactions are then characterized through the networks density and connectivity, shedding light on learning communities and participation. Preliminary results, further research questions, and future directions utilizing social network analysis will be presented.

In this work we investigate the more common alternative conceptions and difficulties of university Mexican students with the concept of direction of a vector before instruction. 
We present students difficulties with the vector direction concept due to the use of two conventions in the Mexican system. The common direction conception in the American system conflicts with a convention of this property as it is composed of two separate properties: direction as the line of action and sense as which way it points. Both conventions are regularly used in the Mexican educational system. 
Additionally, based on the work of Nguyen and Meltzer [1], we designed questions in which students are asked for direction of a vector without indicating any particular convention, and questions indicating the line of action convention. We compare responses of students in the two types of problems, we analyze alternative conceptions of direction in the first type (investigating in depth the ones detected in [1]), and alternative conceptions of direction and sense in the second type of problems.

The majority of students in many introductory calculus-based physics classes are not majoring in physics, but instead are engineering students.  The engineering discipline has its own education research community and its own conceptual evaluations. This poster introduces one of those evaluations, the Statics Concept Inventory (SCI). Some concepts probed by the SCI are similar to those in the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) with only surface features changed (e.g. drawing style).  We will compare the initial results of a joint research project involving engineering and physics faculty. We show results from students who took both the SCI and FCI in both introductory engineering and physics courses at a two-year college.

Teaching experiences, as part of the University of Colorado Partnerships for Informal Science Education in the Community (PISEC) [1] K12 after school program, provide university students with an opportunity to learn how to speak about science in everyday language.  Formative and summative evaluations included pre, post, and in situ video taping of student teaching, surveys of student attitudes about science and teaching, observations, and ethnographic field notes. This poster focuses on case studies which demonstrate the impact of informal science teaching opportunities and particularly on the abilities of university students to communicate about science in everyday language. We find that students with more interactive experiences post larger gains than students whose experiences were less interactive.

From prior research we know that the majority of college freshmen view knowledge as an object, emanating from an external authority such as a professor or a textbook. By the time graduate students complete their degree they are expected to have shifted from recipients of knowledge to creators of knowledge. To distinguish these two different scenarios, we will introduce the idea of locus of authority. If students are to view knowledge as constructed by themselves rather than an object received from an authority figure, they need to start viewing themselves as an authority. Thus the locus needs to shift from external sources to within themselves. We will discuss the theoretical implications of this idea for the activities of learning, teaching, and research. Here, we will apply the locus of authority idea to examine how graduate students face the difficult task of being both student and teacher at the same time.

AAAS has noted that middle-school students may think experiments are a way to produce a desired outcome, rather than of testing ideas." Last school year, OSU Marion collaborated with the entire Grant Middle School (Marion) science faculty to improve science teaching and learning systemically. We developed an astronomy unit that would address major parts of Ohio standards to address this problem by instituting an investigation that would occur over the school year. We asked students to observe and infer these motions without telling them what was expected. Only part of what we planned was implemented because few Moon observations (done at home) were made. Sun shadows were observed roughly monthly by students; a daub of paint on a wood platform indicated the tip of the shadow. We present the results of the yearlong investigation and speculate on whether this could be a useful way to address the AAAS's concern.

We have measured upper-division physics majors' performance using two research-based conceptual instruments in E&M, the BEMA [1] and the CUE (Colorado Upper Division Electrostatics assessment[2].) The BEMA has been given pre/post in freshman E&M (Physics II) courses, and the BEMA and CUE have been given as a pre/post-test in several upper-division E&M courses.   Some of the data extends over 10 semesters. We used PER-based techniques to transform the introductory and upper-division courses starting in Fall 2004 and 2007, respectively [2,3]. Our longitudinal data allows us to measure "fade" on BEMA performance between freshman and junior year.  We investigate the effects of curricula on students by comparing juniors who were enrolled in traditional vs transformed physics as freshmen, as well as those who were enrolled in transformed or traditional upper-division E&M I, using both BEMA and CUE measures.  We find that while freshman reforms significantly impact BEMA scores, junior-level reforms affect CUE but not BEMA outcomes.

The development of reliable and valid measures of science teacher knowledge is essential for the evaluation of teacher education programs. A particular challenge is that most programs serve pre-service teachers with a range of disciplinary specialties. Is it best to measure science teacher knowledge within individuals' science specialty, or can this be measured domain-generally for the sciences? In this research, we investigated this question by developing a physics-specific measure of science teacher knowledge. We then conducted an experiment in which we randomly administered a domain-general measure or the parallel physics-specific measure to a population of pre-service science teachers. We also interviewed and observed the teaching practices of two subsets of participants in order to contribute to our understanding of what is being measured. The empirical evidence gathered serves to further develop the Flexible Application of Student-Centered Instruction (FASCI) instrument, and contributes to our understanding of science teachers pedagogical content knowledge.

Over the last decade, science education researchers in the US have studied students beliefs about science and learning science and measured how these beliefs change in response to classroom instruction in science. In this work, we present an Arabic version of the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) which was developed to measure students beliefs about physics at King Saud University (KSU) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We will describe the translation process, which included review by four experts in physics and science education and ten student interviews to ensure that the statements remained valid after translation. We have administered the Arabic CLASS to over 300 students in introductory physics courses at KSUs mens and womens campuses. We will present a summary of students beliefs about physics at KSU and compare these results to similar students in the US.

We have developed a multiple choice test designed to probe students conceptual understanding of the relationships between force, velocity, and acceleration. The test was administered to more than 800 students in standard or honors introductory physics courses or a second-year physics majors course. We report on several validity and reliability measures for the test including correlations with grade, course level, and the Force Concept Inventory. Results indicate that students are much more likely to respond that the velocity of an object can be zero or opposite to the acceleration than the velocity can be zero or opposite to the net force. The data also indicates a possible evolution from the common misconception, that velocity must be in the direction of the acceleration or net force, through an intermediate model where velocity can be opposite to or in the direction of the acceleration or net force but not zero.

A problem in resource theory is to describe the creation of new, high-level resources. We give an example of resource creation by analyzing four student groups separating variables in a group quiz setting.  The task was to solve an air resistance problem with uncommon initial conditions.   The fluency of each group is described by three observables:  use of overt mathematical language (such as divide, subtract, or equals), use of covert mathematical language (such as moving, bringing, or pulling over), and use of accompanying gestures (such as circling, grabbing, or sliding). For each group, the type of language and gesture used corresponds to how easily they carry out separation of variables.  We create resource graphs [1,2] for each group to organize our observations and use these graphs to describe a potential reification  process [3] for the procedural resources grouping and separate variables.

Newton's Third Law is a difficult concept to teach well, and middle school students' ideas are mediated by their teachers' conceptions as well as their lived experiences.  As part of a school-year course for in-service middle school  using inquiry techniques with teachers, eighth-grade science teachers studied Newton's Third Law and how to facilitate their students' learning of it, and taught their students. In this study, we self-assessed the teachers' learning of Newton's Third Law, and they assessed their students using a similar instrument. From student gains, we compare teachers' ideas and their students' learning.

Learning by Design (TM) follows a tight spiral approach with multiple passes through the same Newtonian principles in a project based curriculum. This afforded a time series measurement of understanding to explore conceptual development. Such a measurement, based on the FMCE, was conducted in two years of middle school. Data is presented from each of these years that demonstrates a temporary degradation of performance during that development. By comparison with early childhood data on U-shaped development, a possible explanation is advanced, but further work is required to test that hypothesis as this particular experiment has significant confounding variables.

Online implementation of physics learning materials may present a powerful method of data collection, in addition to being useful for supplemental instruction.  This may have implications for composite instruction and research designs.  We have developed three lessons on Newton's laws and implemented them on the Internet.  The lessons ask students to make observations and measurements using video clips, perform calculations and answer open-ended questions.  Responses can be collected via an online response system.  110 university students enrolled in an algebra-based physics course and 30 high school physics students worked through some or all of our lessons, and their responses were collected.  We present a qualitative and quantitative analysis of their responses and assess the implications for optimal design of online lesson materials for collecting meaningful data about student understanding of basic physics concepts.

Open, online, homework help forums are websites where any student with Internet access can post questions from their coursework.  By participating in these homework forums, students have access to more knowledgeable peers and experts who voluntarily provide help and encouragement.  These forums provide a new context for studying help-seeking behavior, tutoring strategies, and can serve as a catalog of common student difficulties.  In this poster, we focus on the two largest english-speaking physics forums:  www.physicsforums.com and www.cramster.com.  For PhysicsForums, we collected a month's worth of tutoring exchanges for introductory physics homework.  We analyzed the participation structure of the exchanges by tabulating conversational turns, giving insight into the social interactions that occur. We also qualitatively analyzed the exchanges based on the quality of the instruction and the sophistication of the pedagogical approaches employed by the tutors.  In addition, we conducted a much briefer analysis of Cramster.  We conclude that effective tutoring can occur in this setting if tutors have the goal of encouraging active student learning.

This research turns the PER lens back in the developmental timeline, asking how early instruction using microcomputer-based laboratories (MBL) and interactive lecture demonstrations (ILD) can teach second and third graders motion concepts, using motion graphs as representational tools. Seventeen children in a mixed-age second and third grade classroom participated in the study. In the first session the children explored MBL materials in a semi-structured manner. The second session followed the structure of ILDs (a structured prediction/observation/report approach). Each session lasted one hour. Qualitatively, the children demonstrated understanding slope (both direction and speed), and the graph as a narrative of motion. Qualitatively, children revealed that they were extending their understanding of the motion graph representation beyond the target instruction. This research summarizes an encouraging first step that PER has applications when working with much younger students, not only in teaching motion concepts but also in promoting the use of abstract tools.

Physics Union Mathematics (PUM) is a new physics curriculum spanning from middle to high school. The physics curriculum is based on the successful college-level Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) curriculum in which students engage in the thought processes physicists use to construct new knowledge. An important feature of PUM is the development of mathematical reasoning skills from the outset in the context of learning physics. PUM is infused with grade-appropriate mathematical tools, and activities in which students use those tools to reason about physics. Starting in September 2008, 40 New Jersey teachers field-tested modules of the curriculum. In this poster we focus on the development of specific mathematical tools used in scientific reasoning  integers and zero, graphs and rates of change, bar charts, proportional reasoning, and algebraic descriptions- and how students at this level use them to reason. We will share the results of the implementation of 4 modules.

We will present the approach we used to reform the first semester of the introductory algebra-based physics course at The George Washington University. The reform methodology sought to enhance students cognitive development and improve their attitudes towards learning physics. The pedagogical approaches we developed include: 1) classification schemes that organize physics problems according to features related to physics principles; 2) learning progressions that combine traditional and research-based physics problems such that students gradually experience a new type of thinking as they learn a new topic; and 3) GW-ACCESS problem-solving protocol that builds on existing protocols but is accompanied by a specific teaching methodology and assessment. The instructional environment that we designed allows for explicit monitoring, control and measurement of the cognitive processes exercised during the instruction period.  We will discuss the course objectives, the teaching methodology and the results that show improvement in student attitudes and their problem-solving abilities.

During hundreds of student interviews, we have seen students engage in productive scientific exploration with PhET Interactive Simulations (sims).  Recently we have been working to determine what specific features of PhET sims are necessary to make them effective learning tools. In this study, we compare differences in student learning and sim investigation when the sim either shows or hides representations of abstract or invisible phenomena such as a magnetic field or electron flow in a wire.  Specifically, we conducted individual interviews with introductory-level university physics students, some of whom were using Faraday's Electromagnetic Lab as designed and others who used a version of the same sim but without the invisible representations.  Preliminary results indicate that students who saw the representation of electron flow and the magnetic field are more ready to learn about Lenz's Law compared to students who did not see these representations.

Recently, powerful new observations and advances in computation and visualization have led to a revolution in our understanding of the origin, evolution and structure of the universe. These gains have been vast, but their impact on education has been limited. At Chicago State (CSU), we are implementing new inquiry-based instructional materials in our astronomy lab course. We are researching the effectiveness of these materials, focusing on student understanding of cosmology. As part of a collaborative effort with the University of Nevada Las Vegas and Sonoma State (SSU) to develop a cosmological subject inventory, we administered an open-ended survey prior to instruction and conducted student interviews using the survey.  Students taking the CSU course were also required to write a guided essay on their beliefs about cosmology. We have collected open-ended post-test data through student exams.  Preliminary results regarding student misconceptions in cosmology and student attitudes toward inquiry will be presented.

The study of how students apply knowledge in new contexts is a currently being researched at Kansas State University.  Resonant phenomena play a crucial role in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a widely used medical tool in todays society and a part of the larger modern miracle medical machines project. The basics of MRI can be taught by looking at the resonance of a compass driven by an electromagnetic field.  However, this is not a system that is familiar to most students, making it beneficial to start by first introducing resonance in the context of a pendulum before shifting over to a system involving magnetism.  We present a case-study on students ability to apply the knowledge learned in the traditional resonant system to the novel system.

At Oregon State University, we are undergoing curriculum reform in large-enrollment introductory calculus-based physics.  We are integrating course goals and materials borrowed from ISLE (Investigative Science Learning Environment) at Rutgers and California State University, Chico.  ISLE has been found to help students develop scientific abilities through processes practiced as authentic scientists.  Using Peer Instruction to engage students in these practices, our curricular reforms are in part aimed at having students be able to justify their own knowledge, and develop ownership of that knowledge, moving into roles of authority with respect to their physics learning.  The instructor works to develop a productive community of practice (Wenger, 1998) enabling students to participate in social interactions and make meaning of their experiences to build a shared repertoire of knowledge.   This poster reports on strategies the instructor uses, challenges faced, and present evidence of both successes and failures in terms of achieving this aim.

As a part of a study of the science preparation of elementary school teachers, we are investigating students abilities to apply scientific concepts to unfamiliar situations. The objective is to construct a method which will enable us to compare how students use their reasoning and their content knowledge across different disciplines. To analyze students answers we developed a rubric based on the hierarchies of knowledge and cognitive processes cited in a two dimensional revision of Blooms taxonomy (1).  In this poster we will present the structure of some content questions and the rubric. In addition we will demonstrate the method of analysis for few example questions.

Understanding factors related to student performance in introductory science courses is necessary for helping a growing number of students who have difficulties with STEM courses to learn and succeed. After conducting a pilot study focusing on Lawsons Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning (CTSR), the authors designed a study to ascertain affective and cognitive factors (as well as social and classroom factors) that may provide predictive power for success in science as measured by course grade.  Data from this study indicate that although both SAT/ACT and CTSR scores correlate with course grade, the CTSR provides no additional predictive power of grade than the SAT/ACT score does. Data also indicates that Science Self-efficacy is correlated with course grade, and provides additional predictive information about student success.

Over the last two years UBC has completely revamped their introductory course for non-physics majors to present physics in terms of everyday situations and real-world issues of energy and climate change.  These changes attempt to reinforce connections between classroom physics and real-world phenomena through the lecture examples, weekly context-rich tutorials, and incorporation of real-world model problems in lab experiments.
A key change was the incorporation of a final project where groups of students research and present on a topic of their choice related to the course.  Students were asked to quantitatively model a real-world situation to make a choice or settle a dispute.  
Near the end of the second year of implementation students were surveyed to examine the projects impact on their attitudes towards physics and were tested for transfer using novel real-world problems.  This poster will present the results of these assessments and discuss their implications for the course.

Before we can develop new techniques in teaching astronomy in a way that effectively dismisses misconceptions, we must first find which are most prevalent and resilient. A study was performed by giving the same astronomy survey to both eighth grade students and introductory physics university students. Some questions from the Astronomy Diagnostic Test  were used, along with a longer question about the phases of the moon.  We found that some misconceptions are held by both eighth graders and university students, while some were more common among the university students. With the results from this study, new curricula and teaching strategies can be formed to counter these alternate conceptions.

We explored students understanding of electric circuits in an introductory, non-science-major physics class (Science 201) at Grove City College.  Differentiating between and understanding current, voltage, and resistance is quite difficult and confusing for many students.  We identified the common misconceptions held by students before, during, and after their class and lab involvement with circuits.  Students in Science 201 spend three lab sessions working with circuits.  We videotaped students using the original laboratory materials, interviewed students about their understanding of circuit concepts after each lab activity, and analyzed diagnostic test data to identify specific problem areas.  We re-wrote the laboratory materials in the hopes of improving student learning.  This poster will present the difficulties students were encountering, describe how we modified the lab materials to better address those difficulties, and summarize the changes in diagnostic data we saw after introducing the modified materials.

Preparation for future learning is a term describing a new approach to transfer. In addition to focusing on the learning environments that help students better apply developed knowledge in new situations researchers are searching for the educational interventions that better prepare the students to learn new information on their own. First PFL studies were conducted by J. Branford and D. Schwartz in psychology and statistics. They found that students who engaged in innovation before being exposed to new material, learned better.  We attempted to replicate their experiments in the field of physics, specifically in the area of conductivity. Using two experimental conditions and one control in terms of doing lab work prior to reading we compared student learning of thermal and electrical conductivity from the written text afterwards. We present the results of groups performance on 7 conceptual questions.

This study investigates the implementation of scientific inquiry practices in the classroom in the context of the new Physics Union Mathematics curriculum. Extensive field notes and Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP) scores from classroom observations and interview transcripts from a small sample of teachers form the data by which we conduct this investigation. These different sources provide us with multiple perspectives and rich qualitative and quantitative data for our study. From them, we construct a picture of what inquiry looks like in a PUM classroom, how teachers use the materials to implement inquiry-based approach in the classroom, what the roles are of both teachers and students, and how we can better prepare teachers to implement inquiry-oriented instruction using PUM. The teachers that participated in the study have varying years of teaching experience and experience practicing inquiry-oriented teaching.

Previously we discussed how well students in an introductory physics course diagnosed their mistakes on a quiz problem with different levels of scaffolding support.  In this case, the problem they self-diagnosed was unusually difficult. We also discussed issues related to transfer, particularly the fact that the transfer problem in the midterm that corresponded to the self-diagnosed problem was a far transfer problem. Here, we discuss a related intervention in which we repeated the study methodology with the same students in the same groups, using a new quiz problem which was more typical for these students and a near transfer problem. We discuss how these changes affected students' ability to self-diagnose and transfer from the self-diagnosed quiz problem to a transfer problem on the midterm exam.

We examine student choices while using PhET computer simulations (sims) to learn physics content. In interviews, students were given questions from the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) and were allowed to choose from 12 computer simulations in order to answer these questions. We investigate students choices when answering FCI questions with sims. We find that while students initially choose sims that match problem situations at a surface level, deeper connections may be noticed by students later on. These results inform us on how people may choose education resources when learning on their own.

In a series of tests administered to introductory physics students, we examine how students answer questions about the direction of the magnetic force on a charged particle.  Data were taken over a period of 17 weeks using differing representations of magnetic field.  Following instruction, a significant proportion of answers (approximately 30% given a magnetic pole representation of field and 20% given field line ) coincided with an overall sign error.  Potential sources of sign error (e.g. "left-hand-rule," physical discomfort, non-commutativity of cross products) were investigated via additional test questions and student interviews.  Evidence from these additional experiments suggests that the sign errors are not systematic within students, but vary randomly.  For example, students using the "left-hand-rule" would consistently answer with a sign error, while students who believe the cross product is commutative would answer with either the correct force or an overall sign error.

We surveyed students taking an introductory university physics laboratory course over the summer. These students are science majors, but not physics majors. 47 students completed a written questionnaire, and 18 of those students were interviewed. Student perceptions of the purpose of the lab course and about what they liked and did not like about the course will be shared. These lead to implications for instruction and implications for improving communication among faculty, teaching assistants, and students.

As part of an ongoing study of student understanding in upper-division thermal physics, we developed a number of simple diagnostic questions designed to probe understanding of basic probability concepts.  As reported in 2007, many students had difficulty in distinguishing the concepts of microstate and macrostate, and in applying mathematical relationships for multiplicity of simple systems.  We have tested a tutorial sequence designed to address some of the difficulties.  In this poster we will briefly summarize previous results, show post-test results from the target courses, and describe aspects of the tutorial sequence that are likely in need of modification.

As part of a large study of how student ideas change in response to instruction, we collect student test data frequently throughout a course, allowing for the measurement of the time-evolution of student knowledge. Some student ideas peak and decay rapidly during a quarter, while others change more slowly. In this poster, we focus on foundational vector manipulation skills in introductory physics. There appears to be a difference between low and high performing students on when they learn the material, how much they learn, and how much they forget.

An interactive teaching approach using personal digital assistants (PDAs) as classroom interaction devices was implemented in two (2) algebra-based physics and two (2) physical science classes in a predominantly Hispanic institution. The preliminary investigation was focused on implementation issues and perceptions of students towards the use of PDAs in the classroom. A 25-item Likert scale survey was developed to determine  students perception about the  use of the PDAs as classroom interaction devices. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed  that there is no significant difference in the degree of agreement of the different group of students in almost all of  the items in the survey. Overall, majority of the students surveyed indicated a positive attitude towards the use of PDAs in physics/physical science classroom, irrespective of their educational background and major.

This poster identifies modes of assessment administration which produce the highest response rates. The analysis compares the response rates of students who answered both the Sources of Self-Efficacy in Science Courses and CLASS surveys administered at Florida International University between Fall 2008 and Spring 2009. The survey administrations, given as both a pre- and post-course surveys, included four factors: two survey formats (paper or online), an incentive (extra credit from the professor or no extra credit), email notifications (two different versions), and follow-up reminders (email, in person, or none). We present findings of this analysis and make recommendations to help streamline their survey administration processes and maximize response rates.

As part of an effort to systematically improve our junior-level E&M I course, we are developing a tool to assess the effectiveness of the course transformations.  With a group of PER and non-PER faculty, we began by explicitly defining what students should be able to do at the end of the course (the learning goals). We established a list of 11 such goals, such as  choose and apply the appropriate problem-solving technique and sketch the physical parameters of a problem. These goals, in conjunction with student observations and interviews, served as a guide for the working group to create the CUE assessment.  The result is a 17-question open-ended post-test (with an optional 7-question pre-test) diagnostic, with an accompanying grading rubric.  We present the preliminary validation of the instrument and rubric, plus results from 4 semesters at the University of Colorado, and 4 additional universities.

The relationship between instructors content knowledge and the chosen pedagogical approach (Pedagogical Content Knowledge - PCK) and its impact on student learning have been a focus of many studies. Usually they employ interviews, observations and surveys. We propose to analyze the instructors choice of educational technologies and corresponding pedagogical-technological decisions to investigate her PCK. For example, the instructors use of clickers can allow the researchers to gain significant information about her PCK even without observing the classes, just by inspecting such teaching materials as lecture notes. The analysis of the types of questions included in lectures, sequencing of the material covered, etc. should also reveal information about the instructor's Subject Matter Content Knowledge (SMCK). We propose the framework for doing such an analysis as applied to clicker technologies implemented by science and mathematics instructors. One of the biggest advantages of such an analysis compared to an interview is its objectivity.

Introductory physics is taken annually by hundreds of undergraduates at Ryerson University. The diversity of our students (a large Canadian urban university) reflects the diversity of Toronto. Their educational backgrounds also vary substantially. Since students learning outcomes in the introductory science courses have a significant impact on their success in the science programs, we decided to investigate how student demographic and educational diversity affects their success in introductory physics. As expected, we found that the completion of a senior high school physics course positively impacts students success in the course. The unexpected result was that gender remained a predictor of the students success even when the completion of high school physics was accounted for. Interestingly, other demographic characteristics, (mother tongue, immigration, parental education) seem not to matter. The results suggest that the impact of completing high school physics may extend far beyond the first year, significantly hindering girls success in SMET disciplines.

As part of a pre-service science course for teachers at California Polytechnic University, Pomona we provided an early field inquiry-based teaching experience. A K-12 science specialist and Cal Poly faculty member worked together to help students develop a formal standards-based lesson plan and present to a class of 4th grade students in a local elementary school. Data will be presented to demonstrate the effect of the field experience in student content knowledge, science reasoning skills, ability to teach inquiry-based science lessons, as well as their attitudes towards teaching.

Students intuitive ideas and tacit understandings about forces and motion are usually at odds with normative physics knowledge. In this project, we have developed a video game to increase students understanding of Newtonian mechanics by giving them an opportunity to explore and articulate their tacit understandings, while retaining the strong motivational components of current commercial game design. The game play involves students manipulating the motion of an object to navigate mazes or hit projectile targets. Different forms of representations of motion (such as vector arrows and motion maps) are utilized in the game. This study examines how visual and position-based aspects of the representations help or hinder students in gaining understanding of the concepts and articulating them in a context outside of the game. Specifically, we are looking at how students are able to coordinate multiple representations and use them to make sense of the physics concepts involved.

This study examines the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of beginning physics teachers through two different research lenses  cognitive and teacher education research. The cognitive research lens examines PCK through the nature of expertise. Beginning physics teachers are considered novices, and therefore exhibit certain characteristics in terms of knowledge structure and pedagogies specific to teaching physics. The teacher education research lens examines PCK as one element within the necessary knowledge for teaching. All teachers move through a continuum of professional development, where beliefs about teaching interact with different types of knowledge (content, pedagogical, context, and pedagogical content knowledge) and classroom practice. Each of these areas develops with time spent in the profession of teaching. Data collected from four beginning secondary physics teachers over their first two years of teaching are used to illustrate similarities and differences between these two research lenses, within the characterization and development of PCK for teaching physics.

During the Fall of 2008 a survey, designed to collect information about pedagogical knowledge and practices, was delivered to a representative sample of physics faculty across the United States.

Additionally, we present results related to faculty knowledge and use of specific products from Physics Education Research, as well as an analysis of the reasons faculty give for not using more of these products.

It is often hoped that, as students are enculturated into the practice of physics, they will begin to use multiple representations for problem solving, sense making, and communication. This study examined how different tools influenced students choice of representations when communicating with the instructor in a written lab report. In one section of an introductory physics laboratory course, every student had a Tablet PC that served as a digital-ink based lab notebook. With digital labbooks, students could seamlessly create hand-drawn graphics and equations, and write lab reports on the same computer used for data acquisition, simulation, and analysis. In another laboratory section, students used traditional printed lab guides, kept paper notebooks, and then wrote lab reports on regular laptops. Analysis of the lab reports showed differences between the sections use of multiple representations, including an increased use of diagrams and equations by the tablet users.

Using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest comparison group research design, the relative effectiveness of an interactive teaching approach using personal digital assistants (PDAs) as interaction tool (experimental group) was compared with a similar teaching approach which used flashcards as the interaction tool (comparison group). Two introductory algebra-based physics classes were purposely selected as participants of the study. The descriptive analysis of the mean gain scores in the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) showed that there is a significant difference on the mean gain scores between the experimental and comparison groups. Furthermore, the calculated Cohens index of effect size (d=0.6988) indicates that the average gain scores in the experimental group exceeds 76% of the gain scores of the comparison group. Our data suggest that the interactive teaching approach using PDAs as classroom interaction device is more effective in promoting conceptual understanding compared to an interactive teaching approach using flashcards.

As educators working within the context of research focused universities, we are encouraged to undertake scholarly inquiry into our teaching and learning practices.  In this paper we demonstrate how practitioner (action) research and design-based research integrate to enable the scholarship of teaching as modelled by Boyer (1990) and Trigwell, Martin, Benjamin and Prosser (2000). A teaching development initiative, the workshop tutorials, will be used to exemplify both research methodologies.  An overlying interpretive theoretical perspective will be used to reflect on the evolution of the workshop tutorials. The perspective allows us to propose five key features that explain why design-based research offers a methodological framework for the broad description and conduct of scholarly inquiry into teaching and learning in physics and other disciplines.

The main goal for the Redesigned Introductory Physics Lab (RIPL) project at Appalachian State is to improve student performance and attitudes in the algebra sequence.  An additional goal is to affect student performance in the lecture portion, independent of the instructors pedagogical approach.  Preliminary results indicate a large positive difference (8 to 10 points on 100-point scale) in all course measures (exams, homework, etc.) for students in the redesigned lab compared to those in the standard lab offered by the department.  On the other hand, FCI and other diagnostic scores show little difference between the two groups.  While these measures indicate a discrepancy in the redesigned lab impact, an item-by-item analysis of the diagnostics reveals a rich story, one that can be used to improve both lecture and lab activities.  Some examples, and their implications, will be discussed.

Time-series designs are an alternative to pretest-posttest methods that are able to identify and measure the impact of multiple educational interventions.  In this study, we use an instrument employing standard multiple-choice conceptual questions (e.g., from CSEM) to collect data from students at regular intervals.  The questions are modified by asking students to distribute 100 confidence points among the options in order to indicate which options they think are more likely to be correct.  Tracking the class-averaged confidence ratings for each option produces a set of time-series.  Intervention ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) analysis can then be used to test for, and measure, structural changes in each series.  In particular, it is possible to discern which interventions (lectures, labs, etc.) were able to produce significant and sustained changes in class performance.  Cluster analysis can also identify groups of students whose ratings evolve in similar ways.  Methods and preliminary findings are presented.

While research on educational transformation has traditionally focused on studying student learning outcomes, little work has examined students perception of the tools and classroom culture associated with transformed pedagogies.  We present analyses of students perceptions of the Tutorials spanning five years at the University of Colorado in hopes of understanding the meaning students are making of this reform.  We share results based on two types of data: 1) data from a Student Assessment of their Learning Gains (SALG) style instrument, designed to identify students broad perceptions of the utility and enjoyment of Tutorials,  and 2) more detailed survey data that targets students perceptions of peer interactions and student-TA interactions in the Tutorials, as well as the coordination of the Tutorials with other course components.  We find themes that are consistent across Physics 1 & 2 as well as certain semester-by-semester (or instructor dependent) differences.

As part of a large study of how student ideas change in response to instruction, we collect student test data frequently throughout a course, allowing for the measurement of the time-evolution of student knowledge.  We tracked students'  beliefs about the connections between physics class and real world ideas throughout a three-quarter sequence in introductory physics at the advanced honors level. In general, scores decline steadily throughout the sequence, though there are some interesting anomalies.

In order to help students overcome documented difficulties learning
quantum mechanics (QM) concepts, we have transformed our upper-division QM I course using principles of learning theory and active engagement. Key components of this process include learning goals and a valid, reliable conceptual assessment tool to measure the extent to which students achieve these learning goals. The course learning goals were developed with broad faculty input, and serve as the basis for the design of the course assessment tool. The development of the assessment tool has included significant faculty input and feedback, over 21 student interviews, review of PER literature, and administration of the survey to two semesters of QM I students as well as to a cohort of graduate students. Here, we discuss this ongoing development process and present initial results from our quantum mechanics class for the past two semesters.

We are investigating what facilitates or impedes mathematical sense-making -- seeking for meaning and coherence between mathematics and the physical system-- by students in their introductory physics and engineering courses. As such, we have administered epistemological surveys and conducted clinical interviews with students in introductory physics and basic circuits courses. A comparison of clinical interviews of two students, Matt and Emily, illustrates a trend: the tendency to hook up mathematical formalism to the physical intuition facilitates conceptual understanding and problem-solving.  Although Matt and Emily both possess the needed basic math skills and physical ideas, Matt solves problems more fluidly and successfully for two reasons: (1) he has formed cognitive units, called symbolic forms [1], in which an algebraic template is tied to a conceptual interpretation, and (2) his epistemological beliefs about math, unlike Emily's, support his using these symbolic forms as a central part of his problem solving.

This is an ongoing study where the objective is to design a concept test to evaluate the understanding and interpretation of calculus graphs. The instrument is based on a modified version of the Test of Understanding Graphs in Kinematics (TUG-K) [1]. The modified version has the intention to obtain more accurate results in its assessment of student understanding, i.e. a complete taxonomy of the student state in kinematics [2]. A new context-free version (TUG-C) was created to evaluate student interpretation of calculus graphs. A total of 365 students participated in the study from two courses in a university level: Introductory Physics and Introductory Calculus. A total of 158 students were administered the kinematics test and 207 of them the context-free test. This work will present data showing preliminary results of the test and a study on how the context affects students understanding of graphs.

While expert physicists may agree on how to apply the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, instructors often hold different views regarding the role of interpretation of quantum phenomena when teaching an introductory course on modern physics.  There has been relatively little research in the physics education community on the variation in student perspectives in interpreting quantum phenomena, and how these instructional choices impact student thinking.  We investigate two modern physics courses taught at the University of Colorado where the instructors held markedly different views on how to teach students about quantum processes, and find significant differences in how students from these two courses responded to end-of-term surveys designed to probe their attitudes and beliefs about quantum mechanics.

Prior research has shown: 1) males outperform females on conceptual assessments (a gender gap) at our institution, 2) the gender gap persists despite the use of research-based reforms, and 3) the gender gap is correlated with students physics and mathematics background and prior attitudes and beliefs [Kost, et. al. PRST-PER, 5, 010101].  We next begin to explore how males and females experience the introductory course differently and how these differences relate to the gender gap.  In a survey to students in the introductory course we investigated students physics identity and sense of belonging, epistemology, and self-efficacy.  We find there are significant gender differences in each of these three areas, and further find that these measures are weakly correlated with student conceptual performance, and moderately correlated with course grade.

Will students achieving greater FCI gains be less likely to use force synonymously with other terminology following instruction?  Can reasoning ability or demonstrated conceptual understanding of force be used as a predictor of accuracy in the usage of the term force?  For this particular study, 230 participants completed Force Concept Inventory (FCI) pre- and post-tests, Lawsons Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning (TSR) and Mechanics Language Usage (MLU) pre- and post-tests.  The conventional expected result was not strongly supported. Although individuals with greater FCI gains had greater TSR scores, these students did not necessarily use force more discerningly.  That is, regardless of FCI gains and reasoning ability, there is a noted tendency for students to continue using force equivalently with other colloquial terms like power, energy, strength and momentum.  The data for this study were collected in large enrollment lecture based algebra physics classes, first semester.

A growing number of faculty are using clicker questions and peer instruction in introductory physics courses at institutions across the US; however, this approach is rarely used in upper-division physics courses. At the University of Colorado at Boulder, an increasing number of faculty are incorporating clicker questions in upper-division courses  clickers have been used 24 times in 10 different upper-division courses by 14 different faculty. Here, we report on the results of a survey administered to over 250 students in 12 classes. We find that 79% of the students recommend using clickers in upper-division courses.  In all classes, a majority of students favor clickers and there are few negative responses. We also analyze students responses as to why and how clickers support their learning, and report on how students recommend that faculty implement clickers in their courses (e.g. 2-5 questions interspersed with lecture). For upper-division clicker questions see http://www.colorado.edu/physics/EducationIssues/cts/index.htm.

Previous work with applying cluster analysis to free response questions about two-dimensional motion has shown suggestive similarities between the groups found by the cluster analysis and the traditional classifications of student responses [1].   A comparison of cluster analysis and traditional classifications over a single class, however, was unable to make any hard and fast conclusions because the cluster analysis results were unreliable for that population size (N = 106) [2].  In this poster we present the results of making the same kind of pivot table comparison over a larger data set (N = 677) which served to reduce the amount of noise in the cluster analysis results.

Epistemic cognition occurs when a person is solving a problem that does not have one right answer (a multiple-possibility problem), and thus she/he has to examine different possibilities, assumptions, and evaluate the outcomes. Epistemic cognition is an important part of thinking in real life. Physicists routinely engage in epistemic cognition when they solve problems. But in educational settings we polish problems and make them single-possibility problems. Thus students rarely get a chance to engage in epistemic cognition while working on problem-solving tasks. We introduced multiple-possibility physics problems in recitation sections of an algebra-based introductory physics course at Rutgers University. In this poster we describe how we incorporated the cognitive apprenticeship framework in the course and evaluated its effectiveness as a method of enhancing students' epistemic cognition level.

We analyze FCI data from three different instructors using an approach based on standard tools of IRT (Item Response Theory) using variables such as student proficiency, question difficulty, and a concept's 'learning probability' after instruction. Results allow us to hierarchically classify concepts by their 'difficulty', find the likelihood a concept will be acquired at a given proficiency level and find how strongly a question discriminates between proficiency levels. We also demonstrate the potential of such deeper statistics to illuminate differences between classrooms by decomposing instructional effectiveness into appropriate vectors.  The result is a visual and intuitive portrait that informs us about the FCI, and how students acquire concepts in different instructional settings.

As part of a hybrid course in a calculus-based introductory E&M at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, we have implemented Multimedia Learning Modules [1] through the blackboard learning management system.

We will describe the research project and discuss the impact it had on student preparation, exam performance, and their attitude towards online material.

This study identifies student models underlying the difficulties which were affected by the student na�ve understanding of collisions. Based on the identified student models, teaching models are developed to facilitate student learning. The results of the study show that most students have difficulty in identifying the appropriate system to qualitatively interpret the principles of energy conservation in an elastic collision and the principle of momentum conservation in both elastic and inelastic collisions, due to the difficulties in visualizing the energy and momentum transfer during collisions.  The student reasoning can be grouped into three categories: correct models, incorrect models, and null models. Based on the student models, the teaching approach incorporating quantitative demonstrations has been developed to help students with their learning in the class. The study found that after this instruction, many students shift from incorrect to correct models and develop independent models consistent with the scientifically correct explanation.

Case-reuse strategies involve extracting the conceptual schema from previous cases and adapting them to new problems.  Recognizing the deep structure differences and similarities between problems is essential for productive case reuse.  We report on a semester-long study with students participating in weekly focus group learning interviews to facilitate case reuse strategies.  At the mid and end points of the study, students were interviewed individually to ascertain the effect of these strategies.  During these interviews students were asked to rate the similarities between problem pairs, identify the underlying principles of these problems and determine which problems from the collection might be most or least helpful as worked out examples to solve a new challenging problem.  We will report on the results from these interviews as well as present a comparison with expert responses to these questions.

The effectiveness of Peer Instruction is often associated to the importance of in-class peer-discussions. Reflection or time-on-task may also explain this effectiveness because students answering ConcepTests reflect more and spend more time thinking about concepts. An identical sequence of conceptual questions was given to three groups of students. All groups were polled twice on each question. Between polls, the first group was asked to discuss their choice with a peer, the second group was asked to reflect for a minute (no discussion), and the third group was given a distraction task (sequence of cartoons: no discussion and no reflection). All three groups displayed gains between the first and the second polls. The Distract group had less gain (3.4%) than the Reflect group (9.7%) while the Discuss group had most (21.0%). All groups show gains, potentially because of a testing effect although peer-discussions clearly yield greatest changes.

This paper continues a presentation given at the AAPT conference, providing further discussion of theoretical conjectures about and implications of our findings. Previous work suggests college students have more difficulty lighting a bulb with a single wire and a battery than with two wires (Slater et al., 2000), results that have informed the design of activities (Schaffer & McDermott, 1992). I present some unexpected findings from two 4th grade classes engaged in a 15-hour inquiry module on electric circuits. Students successfully lit the bulb with a single wire in a variety of ways, but students from both classes showed and expressed the view that the bulb must be in direct contact with a battery in order for it to light. I offer an interpretation of this in terms of a resources perspective (diSessa, 1993; Hammer et al., 2005), where spontaneously generated explanations and actions are contextually sensitive.

A major achievement of the first twenty years of neuroimaging is to reveal the brain networks that underlie fundamental aspects of attention, memory and expertise. We examine some principles underlying the activation of these networks. These networks represent key constraints for the design of teaching. Individual differences in these networks reflect a combination of genes and experiences. While acquiring expertise is easier for some than others the importance of effort in its acquisition is a basic principle.

Networks are strengthened through exercise, but maintaining interest that produces sustained attention is key to making exercises successful. The state of the brain prior to learning may also represent an important constraint on successful learning and some interventions designed to investigate the role of attention state in learning are discussed. Teaching remains a creative act between instructor and student, but an understanding of brain mechanisms might improve opportunity for success for both participants.

I will present two case studies of different early high school classes constructing (with no direct instruction from teachers) ways of explaining temperature equilibration. Students were asked to explain, when a cold glass of milk is left on the kitchen table, how and why does it come to room temperature? The first case study shows an unusually clear example where students build an essentially correct causal explanatory scheme (Newton's law of heating) pretty much simply by combining a number of reasonably well-documented intuitive ideas. The second case study shows a similar construction, but of an incorrect causal scheme. Because the elements used in the first case have been reasonably well-studied, we can determine both what had to change in the pieces and how the pieces were combined. This leads to a list of plausibly general "mechanisms of learning."

These days, the times of incessant changes, everything seems to be fluid, including our ways of looking at the world and of talking about it. Although easily noticeable also in 'hard' sciences, nowhere is this conceptual fluidity more conspicuous than in research on human learning. In this talk, after a very brief historical review, I will concentrate on two basic metaphors for learning in which current educational research seems to be grounded: the metaphors of learning-as-acquisition and of learning-as-participation. It will be claimed that these metaphors generate discourses which are incommensurable rather than incompatible - discourses which, although seemingly contradictory, can live side by side without any risk to the consistency of the research enterprise. Researches should be choosing their leading metaphor according to their needs. Using empirical examples as illustration, I will discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of each of the two options.

Fundamental concepts in physics such as Newtonian mechanics are surprisingly difficult to learn and discover.  Physicists, philosophers, and educators have painstakingly detailed the use of concepts such as force yet the underlying mechanisms involved in the use of these concepts has been elusive.  Over the past decade we have been using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), brain damaged populations, and other neuroimaging techniques to uncover the neural substrates of conceptual change.  Using tasks derived from physics, chemistry, and biology we have found that conceptual change often involves the inhibition of prior knowledge and/or the recategorization of knowledge. The specific brain sites that we have discovered as being involved in conceptual change are the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate as well the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These regions are part of a network of brain sites that are involved in changes in knowledge use that are modulated both by experience and situational factors.  In this presentation I outline our findings and the implications for educational interventions.

We have investigated and analyzed in detail the cognition of an expert tackling a qualitative conceptual physics problem of an unfamiliar type.  The basic but non-trivial task was to find qualitatively the acceleration direction of a pendulum bob at various stages of its motion, originally studied by Reif and Allen.  Methodology included introspection, retrospection and self-reported metacognition. Different reasoning was used for different points on the motion path, revealing multiple facets of cognition, including its context- and background-dependence. An account will be given of the zigzag thinking paths and interplay of various reasoning modes and knowledge elements invoked. We interpret the cognitive processes using theoretical ideas such as: case-based, principle-based and experiential-intuitive reasoning; general strategies; schemata; association and transfer; cueing and interference; metacognition and epistemic frames. The rich microcosm of cognition brought out in this case study contrasts with the tidy systematic problem solutions we usually present to students.  We discuss implications for instruction in problem-solving.

We are transforming an upper-division electricity and magnetism course for physics and engineering majors using principles of active engagement and learning theory. The teaching practices and new curricular materials (homeworks, interactive lectures with clickers, and after-class help sessions and tutorials) were guided by the results of observations, interviews, and analysis of student written work to identify common student difficulties with the content, and were informed by explicit learning goals established in collaboration with faculty. In parallel, we are developing a conceptual test, the CUE (Colorado Upper-division Electrostatics instrument), to assess some of the impacts and ongoing evolution of the new curriculum. We present key elements of our research base for these course transformations, including instances where interactive engagement techniques, and our assessment tools and observations, help elucidate student difficulties at this level. Our work underlines the need for further investigation into the nature of student difficulties  and appropriate instructional interventions  for complex physical problem solving at the upper division level.

At Minnesota we have been developing a rubric to evaluate students' written solutions to physics problems that is easy to use and reasonably valid and reliable. The rubric identifies five general problem-solving processes and defines the criteria to attain a score in each (useful description, physics approach, application of physics, math procedures, and logical progression). An important test of the instrument is to check whether these categories represent the actual processes students engage in during problem solving. We will report an analysis of problem-solving interviews conducted with students enrolled in an introductory physics course and discuss the implications of these results for the rubric.

This poster will describe how a group of physics teachers built a professional learning community without ever knowing about this theoretical construct. The community was born to address the needs of seven pre-service physics teachers while supporting each other during student teaching in the Fall of 2003. Since then it has transformed into a living organism, that nurtures new members (now more than 40 in-service teachers), cares for the needs of everyone, provides timely advice for every-day problems, communicates passion to teaching, and provides natural professional development for all of its members. The discussion will focus on the elements of a professional learning community that are absolutely necessary to maintain it, specific features of a physics teachers learning community, and the role of faculty responsible for teacher preparation in helping sustain such a community.

The ability to categorize problems is a measure of expertise in a domain. In order to help students learn effectively, instructors and teaching assistants (TAs) should have pedagogical content knowledge. They must be aware of the prior knowledge of students, consider the difficulty of the problems from students' perspective and design instruction that builds on what students already know. In this targeted poster, we discuss the response of graduate students enrolled in a TA training course to categorization tasks in which they were asked to group problems first from their own perspective, and later from the perspective of introductory physics students.  A majority of the graduate students performed an expert-like categorization of physics problems. However, when asked to categorize from the perspective of introductory students', most students expressed dismay, claiming that either the task was either impossible or pointless. We will discuss how categorization can be a useful tool for scaffolding and improving pedagogical content knowledge of instructors.

One of the primary goals, as students transition from the lower-division
to upper-division courses is to facilitate the cognitive development
needed for work as a physicist. The Paradigms in Physics curriculum
(junior-level courses developed at Oregon State University) addresses this goal by coaching students to coordinate different modes of reasoning, highlighting common techniques and concepts across physics topics, and setting course expectations to be more aligned with the professional culture of physicists. This poster will highlight some of the specific ways in which we address these cognitive changes in the context of classical mechanics and E&M courses.

Learning quantum mechanics is challenging. Our group is investigating cognitive issues in learning quantum mechanics and developing quantum interactive learning tutorials (QuILTs) and tools for peer-instruction based upon cognitive task analysis. Many of the tutorials employ computer-based visualization tools to help students take advantage of multiple representations and develop better intuition about quantum phenomena.  We will discuss the aspects of the cognitive design of the quantum mechanics curriculum that are similar or different from introductory courses and discuss why the analysis of cognitive issues is important for bridging the gap between quantitative and conceptual aspects of quantum mechanics.

The PhET computer simulations (sims) have been demonstrated as successful tools for teaching and learning physics. In this poster we situate PhET sims in a socio-cultural-historical context, focusing on the Wave Interference sim as an example. Sims are cultural tools designed to embody certain norms and practices of the physics community, particularly learning through exploration. This poster focuses on the interaction between three scales of cultural tools: representations (graphs, pictures, etc.), learning tools (sims), and learning environments. Sims can strongly influence the nature of student engagement in the classroom, but they are not magic pills. Classroom environments can drive certain types of activity, but we are not fated to recapitulate traditional educational practices. We will examine critical features of tools across these three scales which support student learning through engaged exploration.

Over the past 10 years I have been using socio-cultural theoretical perspectives to understand how people learn physics in a highly interactive, inquiry-based physics course such as Physics and Everyday Thinking. As a result of using various perspectives (e.g. Distributed Cognition and Vygotsky's Theory of Concept Formation), my understanding of how these perspectives can be useful for investigating students' learning processes has changed. I will illustrate changes in my thinking about the role of socio-cultural perspectives in understanding physics learning and describe elements of my thinking that have remained stable.  Finally, I will discuss pitfalls in the use of certain perspectives and discuss areas that need attention in theoretical development for PER.

Technological tools are widely used in physics education. Many researchers have examined student learning gains associated with activities utilizing technology. Less attention has been given to the role of tools in shaping classroom practices and student interactions. By emphasizing the mediating role tools play, activity theory is ideally suited for examining the impact of tools on classroom culture. This poster uses activity theory to explore two examples where Tablet PCs were used in introductory physics classes. In one example, every student used a Tablet PC to collaborate in small groups during a laboratory course. In a second example, groups of students in an active learning-based course used one Tablet PCs for group work, which the instructor projected during whole class discussions. Use of the Tablet PCs is identified with changes in the nature of student collaboration and in the classroom practices required to support desired class norms.

Ongoing research in physics education has demonstrated that physics majors often do not develop a working knowledge of basic concepts in mechanics, even after standard instruction in upper-level mechanics courses.[1]  A central goal of this work has been to explore the ways in which students make--or do not make--appropriate connections between physics concepts and the more sophisticated mathematics (e.g., differential equations, vector calculus) that they are expected to use.  Many of the difficulties that students typically encounter suggest deeply-seated alternate conceptions, while others suggest the presence of loosely or spontaneously connected intuitions.  Analysis of results from pretests (ungraded quizzes), written exams, and informal classroom observations will be presented to illustrate specific examples of these difficulties.  Also to be presented are examples of particular instructional strategies (implemented in Intermediate Mechanics Tutorials2) that appear to be effective in addressing these difficulties.

Modeling[1] Applied to Problem Solving (MAPS) is a pedagogy that helps students transfer instruction to problem solving in an expert-like manner.  Declarative and Procedural syllabus content is organized and learned (not discovered) as a hierarchy of General Models.  Students solve problems using an explicit Problem Modeling Rubric that begins with System, Interactions and Model (S.I.M.).  System and Interactions are emphasized as the key to a strategic description of the system and the identification of the appropriate General Model to apply to the problem.  We have employed the pedagogy in a three-week review course for students who received a D in mechanics.  The course was assessed by a final exam retest as well as pre and post C-LASS surveys, yielding a 1.2 standard deviation improvement in the students' ability to solve final exam problems and a statistically significant positive shift in 7 of the 9 categories in the C-LASS.

Efforts to document the complex learning community established by the Center for High Energy Physics Research and Education Outreach (CHEPREO) initially focused on classroom based measures of Modeling Instruction.  Classroom-based measures alone are insufficient to understand complex phenomena such as participation, retention, and persistence shown by our students.  The underlying Vygotskian perspective on learning in Modeling Instruction motivated a shift in unit of analysis, moving beyond standard measurements of physics classes toward understanding the patterns of interactions and participation in learning communities. Changing the unit of analysis from the class to the learning community allows us to consider the roles of social and cultural influences on participation, persistence and retention. In this poster we re-frame the CHEPREO reform efforts through an ecological framework [Aubusson] and describe how this framing supports students especially given the cultural makeup of FIU's student body.

I will discuss some observations from using interactive-engagement instructional methods in an upper-level thermal physics course over a two-year period. From the standpoint of the subject matter knowledge of the upper-level students, there was a striking persistence of common learning difficulties previously observed in students enrolled in the introductory course, accompanied, however, by some notable contrasts between the groups. More broadly, I will comment on comparisons and contrasts regarding general pedagogical issues among different student sub-populations, for example: differences in the receptivity of lower- and upper-level students to diagrammatic representations; varying receptivity to tutorial-style instructional approach within the upper-level population; and contrasting approaches to learning among physics and engineering sub-populations in the upper-level course with regard to use of symbolic notation, mathematical equations, and readiness to employ verbal explanations.

This inter-active poster seeks provides case studies of two educational environments, one, a formal introductory college level course that implements several PER-based innovations, the other, an informal afterschool educational program for children 6-18 years old.  Each is considered from two different cultural historical activity theoretic perspectives, which provide the opportunity make sense of both the theory and the educational environments by triangulating among both the theories and the environments. An activity theoretic lens frames the classroom and afterschool program as activity systems where we delineate variation in roles, rules, and distribution of labor surrounding the use of similar tools (physics concepts). A Communities of Practice and Apprenticeship lens frames these environments as allowing or constraining various forms of participation by members both within the classroom community and within the institutional setting.  The authors will share tools that will provide participants and opportunity to apply these perspectives to their own work and compare with our two case studies.

Socio-cultural approaches view learning as a social phenomenon, situated in the course of human activities. Thus, student learning and conceptual change is enhanced by instruction that creates opportunities for students to interact socially with others while engaged in appropriate learning activities. Models of instruction that promote social-interactions include Peer Instruction and community of learners (Brown&Campione,1994). This poster presents results from a case study of an introductory physics course using Peer Instruction. Audio recordings were made of small group conversations where students explained and justified their choices to peers. Discourse analyses of recordings show that students expend greater effort over time, build more rigorous arguments and regulate their discourse using both individual and collective processes of monitoring (eg. in time, peers use as well as demand more precise definitions and justifications before accepting arguments). Our results show changes in individual student's attitudes toward their personal and collective responsibility to classmates.

Most introductory physics instructors are disheartened that students typically view tests and quizzes as summative evaluations and, therefore, miss the tremendous opportunity to learn from their mistakes. One way to address this problem is for the instructor to assign and collect written student assessment corrections.  We have experimented with methods for dealing with this sort of assessment correction that require minimal instructor time. In this poster we i) provide some theoretical arguments supporting this practice, ii) describe several variations of assessment corrections that we have used, and iii) provide some data related to its effectiveness.

Helping students learn from their own mistakes can help them develop habits of mind while learning physics content. Based upon cognitive apprenticeship model, we asked students to self-diagnose their mistakes and learn from reflecting on their problem solution.  Varying levels of scaffolding support were provided to students in different groups to diagnose their errors on two context-rich problems that students originally solved in recitation quizzes. The level of scaffolding necessary for successful self-diagnosis and performance on the transfer task was strongly dependent on the difficulty in invoking and applying physics principles to solve the problems and how far the transfer was. Moreover, a high level of sustained scaffolding may be necessary to teach students problem-solving skills. This targeted poster will summarize our findings from self-diagnosis and near and far transfer associated with two context-rich problems that students self-diagnosed such that one self-diagnosed problem was unusually difficult.

Teachers frequently make sample solutions available to their students, expecting them to learn from their mistakes. However many teachers are concerned that only few of their students engage in such an activity. What happens when students are given time and credit for identifying mistakes they have made by referring to the sample solution? What do students believe qualifies as "diagnosis"?

Our data consists of diagnosis work by 180 Arab-Israeli high school physics students, and 30 American students taking introductory algebra based physics. The findings indicate that while the instructor expected students to focus on the weaknesses of their solutions, many reflected also on their personal involvement in the solution process, their opinion as to the adequacy of the problem statement, etc. Students used the sample solution as a template and identified as deficiency any external deviation of their solution from it.

We have compared performance of students scoring 1 standard deviation below average (D group) with students scoring 1 standard deviation above average (A group) on final exam problems requiring analytic solutions and written plans.  While the D group received 38% fewer total points than the A group, the differences were more dramatic with respect to getting an entire problem correct: for both analytic solutions and plans of attack the A group relative to the D group gave ~ 3.6 times more good answers, and failed to identify all of the physical principles about 3.8 times less often.  We found that students' written plans of attack closely correlated with their analytic solutions in both groups.  We suggest that the typical "one topic per week" organization of introductory courses does not prepare students to identify the physical principles that apply to problems that might involve any of the concepts in the course.

We have given a group of 56 MIT Seniors who took mechanics as Freshmen a written test similar to the final they took at that time, plus the MBT and C-LASS standard instruments. Students unlikely to have reviewed the material in the interim scored half as well as they did as Freshmen on the written part of the test. Their facility with energy and kinematics was comparable to D-level Freshmen. They were less able than D-level Freshmen to construct simultaneous equations describing a dynamics problem, but more able to recognize a two-stage problem and develop subgoals. Their mean score on the MBT was essentially unchanged from the post-test taken as Freshmen, though there were significant shifts in responses to ten of 26 questions. Attitudinal surveys indicate that half the Seniors believe the mechanics course content will be useful to them, while the vast majority believe physics teaches valuable problem solving skills.

Course reform begins with a set of objectives. We started with a Delphi Study based on interviews with experts, developed orthogonal responses to "what should we teach non-physics majors besides the current syllabus topics?" AAPT attendees, atomic researchers, and PERC08 attendees were asked for their selections. All instructors rated "sense-making of the answer" very highly and expert problem solving highly. PERers favored epistemology over problem solving, and atomic researchers "physics comes from a few principles". Students at three colleges had preferences anti-aligned with their teachers, preferring more modern topics, and the relationship of physics to everyday life and to society (the only choice with instructor agreement), but not problem solving or sense-making. Conclusion #1: we must show students how old physics is relevant to their world. Conclusion #2: significant course reform must start by reaching consensus on what to teach and how to hold students' interest (then discuss techniques to teach it).

Research in physics education has conducted significant work at understanding student ideas and applying such understanding to the design of curricular reforms and evaluation instruments.  Studies of classroom practices are beginning to appear more frequently and suggest that we, as a community, may benefit from a broader theoretical lens.  This session focuses on applications of socio-cultural theories to education research in physics and physics teacher preparation.  It includes studies that examine: introductory college classrooms and after-school programs as cultural systems, building a learning community related to becoming and being a physics teacher, educational tools as mediating artifacts in student learning and engagement, and the creation of contexts supportive of all students in learning physics. n Part 1 of this session, we will focus on the role of tools and curricula as mediating artifacts in student learning.

In the last few decades, several exemplary introductory physics curricula have been developed that take into account cognitive issues in the teaching and learning of physics. This session will focus on how physics education researchers, in recent years, have begun developing and evaluating curricula for upper-level physics courses that account for cognitive issues. The poster presenters will discuss cognitive approaches to designing upper-level physics curriculum pertaining to different subject matters. They will particularly focus on analyzing the issues that are common across different subject matters and those that are particularly important for their topic of interest. Presenters will also discuss the importance of various cognitive issues in the design of upper-level courses compared to their importance in developing introductory physics curriculum.

At the heart of course reform lies the question "What do we want the students to learn?" and its complement "What do the students want to get from our course?".  Each question has two parts:  what skills should students master for the final examination, and what skills should they retain at some later point in their lives, for example at graduation?   This targeted poster session reports a series of studies exploring these questions and shows the use of various PER-based diagnostic instruments to evaluate an approach to problem solving inspired by the answers we found.  Since the posters represent work in progress, audience opinion and suggestions will be solicited.

Formative assessment, learning from instructor's sample solution, tutoring students how to deal with a textbook problem: in all these situations novices and experts operate in a context they are likely to represent differently. In Vygotsky's terms, the "situation definition" of the expert often does not correspond to that of the student. "Situation definition" in the context of solving a physics problem refers both to realization of concepts and principles in physics that should be invoked to understand a situation, as well as to "action patterns" such as what the student is expected to do when approaching a problem.<br /><br />Assessment rubrics made available for students can serve to some extent to bridge the gap between students' and instructors' situation definition. Namely, assessment rubrics can serve to convey desired practices as well as to support students' in self diagnosing their work. For example, general, process-oriented problem-solving rubrics may convey desired problem solving approaches.<br /><br />This targeted poster session presents<br />a) examples of assessment and self diagnostic rubrics;<br />b) Dilemmas associated with their design such as how much credit to give to communicating the reasoning vs. Correct physics; and<br />c) research regarding their role in supporting the process of negotiating meaning from the point of view of the student and the instructor:  Do students perceive in the rubrics the message instructors hope to convey? What is their impact on learning?

Whereas PER focuses on how students learn and perform physics tasks (especially those we are interested in teaching them), cognitive psychology research (CPR) focuses more broadly on how the mind works when engaged in cognitive tasks.  This talk will review some of the approaches to experimental design and methodology in CPR and PER, ranging from garden variety behavioral studies, to studies using eye-tracking devices functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The strengths and weaknesses of each method will be addressed in terms of what can, and cannot be learned about human learning, cognitive performance, and ultimately teaching. The session will conclude with views of what PER and CPR can learn from each other.

The essential characteristics of energy are not typically an explicit topic of physics instruction.  Nonetheless, participants in physics courses that involve energy are constantly saying what kinds of thing they think energy might be, both verbally and nonverbally.  The premise of an embodied-cognition theoretical perspective is that we understand the kinds of things that may exist in the world (ontology) in terms of sensory-motor experiences such as object permanence and movement.   We offer an example of an embodied learning activity about energy: that is, an activity in which we deliberately arrange for human bodies to symbolize entities in physical phenomena involving energy transfers and transformations.  Our observations suggest that this Energy Theater uniquely promotes engagement with deep conceptual questions about energy.

Learning Assistants (LAs) at Seattle Pacific University engage in a series of interviews with their non-LA peers to develop their listening and interviewing skills. In the first interview, the LA interviewers are asked to be guests at their interviewees' thinking. In this poster, we focus on two LAs' interpretations of being a guest: wedding guests who do not interfere with the proceedings, and cocktail party guests who contribute ideas to the conversation.  We show how these interpretations are present in their ontological committments, (in)formal use of language, and expectations about interviewing and listening.

Students in introductory physics courses treat problem solving as an exercise in manipulating equations, symbols, and quantities with the goal of obtaining the correct answer. Although this approach is efficient for getting answers, it is far from optimal for learning how conceptual knowledge is applied in the problem solving process. The goal of this study is to refine and evaluate an approach that encourages students to begin by writing a strategic analysis of a problem based on principles and procedures, and then to follow with a documented problem solution that exhibits, side-by-side, how concepts and equations go together in a solution. We will discuss the implementation and effectiveness of this approach in four local high school classrooms.

It has been shown in studies on the subject that many students view science as weakly connected pieces of information to be separately learned in contrast to the web of interconnections perceived by the instructors. Kalman pointed out that developing a scientific mindset may not simply be a conceptual change from personal scientific concepts to scientifically accepted concepts. It may also be a change in attitude from a view that study in science is a matter of solving
problems using as independent set of tools, classified according to problem type, to a view that a science subject consists of a web of interconnected concepts. He has developed a toolbox to bring about the change. Reflective writing is one of these tools. In this study, we use the tradition of case study to explore the relationship among students writing processes, products and attitude to physics and science courses.

As part of research into student understanding of topics related to thermodynamics and statistical mechanics at the upper division, we have identified student difficulties in applying concepts related to the Boltzmann factor and the canonical partition function. With this in mind, we have developed a guided-inquiry worksheet activity (tutorial) designed to help students develop a better understanding of where the Boltzmann factor comes from and why it is useful. The tutorial guides students through the derivation of both the Boltzmann factor and the canonical partition function. Preliminary results suggest that students who participated in the tutorial had a higher success rate on assessment items than students who had only received lecture instruction on the topic. We present results that motivate the need for this tutorial, the outline of the derivation used, and results from implementations of the tutorial.

Recent scientific discoveries have bolstered the Hot Big Bang and Inflation cosmological models for the origin of the universe.  At Chicago State University we endeavor to bring these new findings to the introductory astronomy course through interactive tutorials and hands-on inquiry-based laboratory activities.  We have used science data-based resources as instructional aides to teach students about the expansion and age of the universe.  Student pre-course essays indicate that students enter the class with a wide range of ideas regarding the age of the universe.  Their essays and responses to pre-course surveys reveal that their ideas and the evidence they cite to support it are often incorrect.   We have begun to use analysis of student essays, pre-course surveys, pre and post laboratory assessments, course examinations, and interviews to investigate the extent to which the laboratory activities and tutorials are helping students overcome initial ideas and gain an understanding of this topic.

We compare the effectiveness of brief science workshops that we have conducted for K-12 teachers with the in depth Physics by Inquiry Programs also conducted at University of Cincinnati. A four-week 120-hour Physics by Inquiry course is held for teachers in grades 5-12 and a separate two-week 60-hour course for teachers in grades K-5. Both courses use Physics by Inquiry1 modules developed by Lillian McDermott and the Physics Education Group at the University of Washington.  Due to requests from local school districts, we have also offered short science workshops with durations of from one-half to five days in length. We compared pretest and posttest data for similar physics topics, which were covered using Physics by Inquiry materials, for both the short and longer programs. The gains in conceptual understanding were much greater for the teachers in the more in depth Physics by Inquiry programs.

As a part of a study on the science preparation of elementary school teachers, we are studying students reasoning skills as they apply scientific concepts. We have devised content questions, which are open-ended with the distinguishing feature of applying recently learned concepts in a new context. This requires that students recognize and generalize the relevant facts or concepts and their interrelationships to suggest an applicable or plausible theory. To evaluate students answers, we developed a rubric based on Blooms taxonomy as revised and expanded by Anderson.  We coded the students answers in terms of knowledge types and cognitive process components, and for each component we have defined three levels of accomplishment. This method fulfils our primary objective of constructing a method for comparing students' reasoning across different disciplines. In this paper, we will present an example of a content question and the method of analysis for this case.

This study investigates how the Learning Assistant (LA) experience affects teachers first year of teaching. The LA Program provides interested science majors with the opportunity to explore teaching through weekly teaching responsibilities, an introduction to physics education research, and a learning community within the university environment. Some of these LAs are recruited to secondary science teacher certification programs. We hypothesized that the LA experience would enhance the teaching practices for the LAs who ultimately become teachers. To test this hypothesis, LAs were compared to a matched sample of teachers who completed the same teacher preparation program as the LAs but did not have the LA treatment. LAs and non-LAs were compared through interviews, classroom observations, artifact packages, and observations made with Reformed Teacher Observation Protocol (RTOP) collected within the first year of teaching. Some differences were found, I will discuss these findings and their implications.

Development of students problem solving ability is commonly cited as one of the primary goals in introductory physics courses.  However, there is no broadly agreed upon definition of what is meant by problem solving.  Most physicists ultimate want students to be able to successfully apply a logical yet flexible approach to solving real world problems significantly different from any they have seen before.  Still, many introductory instructors are first and foremost concerned with how successfully and thoughtfully students solve standard textbook-style problems.  We have developed a 15-item survey to help assess students abilities at solving textbook-style problems. In the Fall of 2009, we beta-tested this instrument on introductory physics students (pre-instruction and post-instruction) at several institutes and on a pool of experts. In this poster, we will present details of the survey instrument, its administration, and some results from our first round of testing.

Considering the benefits of modeling instruction in improving conceptual learning while students work more like scientists, an implementation was made in an introductory Physics course in a Mexican University. Recently Brewe, Kramer and O'Brien have observed positive attitudinal shifts using modeling instruction. These results are contrary to previous observations on other methodologies that promote active learning. Inspired in those results, the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) was applied as pre and post tests in two courses with modeling. In comparing the different categories of the CLASS, we have determined positive shifts in all the categories and significantly differences in Overall and Applied Conceptual Understanding for a sample of 44 students. Given the characteristics of the sample, this study has required non parametric methods.

While much work has been done assessing lower-division undergraduate physics courses, there is a dearth of work in upper-division courses.  This study was performed to begin this process in an upper-division advanced laboratory course at the Colorado School of Mines.  A Global Concept Assessment (GCA) was developed and then administered at the beginning and end of the semester to assess student retention of important course concepts.  Additionally, short mini-quizzes were developed for each lab and then administered either directly before or directly after that days lab to investigate whether previewing or reviewing lab content resulted in more effective learning as measured by the GCA.  Results indicate that the lab course is effective at teaching target concepts to a high degree of statistical certainty with negligible differences between preview and review effects.

We examine the performance of a group of students in Introductory Electricity and Magnetism following a ReView course in Introductory Mechanics focusing on problem solving employing the MAPS pedagogy [1]. The group consists of students who received a D in the fall mechanics course (8.01) and were given the chance to attend the ReView course and take a final retest.  Improvement to a passing grade was qualification for the Electricity and Magnetism course in the spring. The ReView course was conducted twice - during January 2009 and January 2010. As a control, we applied a similar procedure to a group of students with similar z-scores in 8.01 in Fall 2007 that were not offered the ReView course. We show that the ReView students perform ~ 0.5 standard deviations better than what is expected based on their performance on the fall exams (p < 0.05).

We report on the process and outcomes from a three-year, six-semester project to develop, establish, and maintain a new course approach in junior-level electricity and magnetism (E&M).  The course outcomes  improved learning gains and positive student attitudes  were sustained over five semesters of transfer between 5 different instructors of our E&M course.  Additionally, the vast majority of the developed materials (i.e., clicker questions, interactive tutorials, modified homework, and documented student difficulties) were used by these instructors as well as being used at other institutions.  These results indicate a high rate of sustainability of the course structure over time, between instructors, and between institutions.  We describe the factors enabling this transfer to date, including instructors personal experiences based on detailed longitudinal interviews.

Although frequently neglected in traditional K16 instruction, 3-D spatial skills are critical to success in science and engineering fields, especially physics. We investigated whether formal spatial skills training can improve achievement in an undergraduate calculus-based mechanics course. Participants (28 female, 49 male) were randomly assigned to either a training group that completed six two-hour spatial training sessions, or a control group that did not. The training group consistently outperformed the control group on the courses exams\quizzes with an effect size of d = 0.38 for the examination composite score. However, the groups did not differ on a Force Concept Inventory (FCI) post-test. Nevertheless, common measures of spatial skills predicted students normalized FCI gains independent of FCI pre-test scores. These results illustrate that developing spatial skills is an important goal of physics instruction, and that improving these skills can improve problem-solving (although not necessarily conceptual understanding) in introductory mechanics.

The Force Concept Inventory (FCI) has been efficiently used to assess conceptual learning in mechanics. Each FCI question has one Newtonian answer and four wrong answers (distracters). Researchers and practitioners most frequently use measures of total score to assess learning. Yet, are all wrong answers equivalent? We conducted Latent Markov Chain Modeling (LMCM) analyses of all choices (right and wrong) on a subset of four FCI questions. LMCM assesses whether there are groups of students sharing similar patterns of responses. We infer that students sharing similar patterns also share similar reasoning. Our results show seven reasoning-groups. LMCM also computes probabilities of transition from one reasoning-group to another following instruction. When examining transitions between groups, we note a clear hierarchy. Groups at the top of the hierarchy are comprised of students that use Newtonian thinking more consistently. Furthermore, proficient students choose some wrong answers more frequently.

We have developed a multiple-choice test designed to probe students' conceptual understanding of the relationships among the directions of force, velocity, and acceleration. We report here on student data taken over the course of instruction in introductory mechanics and electricity and magnetism. This data suggests that honors students move from the common incorrect response, for example that velocity must be in the direction of the acceleration or net force, through a "partially correct" response, that velocity can be either opposite to or in the direction of the acceleration or net force but not zero, before arriving at a correct model. This data is in agreement with previously reported results that showed these patterns among different levels of students but was not a within student study. In addition, we report on the effectiveness of different small computer based training sessions given shortly before students take this quiz.

Interactive simulations can be engaging tools for student learning, allowing students to explore phenomena by asking questions and seeking answers by interacting with the simulation and interpreting the effects. PhET simulations allow this process to happen dynamically so that students can continuously probe and explore the underlying science. For students to use simulations productively, understanding the science in the simulation must be challenging enough to maintain students interest, but not so challenging that students are overwhelmed. A key aspect of achieving a good balance is the complexity of the simulation for students. We have formulated an initial model to quantify complexity based on the number, range, and effects of controls and representations within a simulation. We account for students prior knowledge by adjusting the measured complexity depending on how students interpret the representations and conceptual connections within the simulation. Implications for simulation design and student engagement will be discussed.

The JILA Physics Frontier Center Partnerships for Informal Science Education in the Community (PISEC) provides informal after-school inquiry-based science teaching opportunities for university participants with children typically underrepresented in science. PISEC is in the process of validating the Childrens Attitude Survey (CAS), which is based on the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (designed to measure college students attitudes about science and the nature of science.)  The CAS measures childrens attitudes about science and the nature of science. We present pre- and post-semester results for several semesters of the PISEC program, and demonstrate that, unlike most introductory physics courses in college, after-school informal science programs support and promote positive attitudes about science. This work is supported, in part, by NSF # 0551010, the JILA AMO PFC.

Physics educators and researchers have recently begun to distinguish between pedagogical approaches and educational technologies used to implement them. For instance, peer instruction has been shown to be equally effective, in terms of student learning outcomes, when implemented with clickers or flashcards.  In such a situation, technological tools (clickers and flashcards) can be viewed as mediating pedagogical techniques (peer instruction or traditional instruction). In this paper, we use activity theory to understand peer instruction, with particular attention to the role of tools. This perspective helps clarify clickers and flashcards differences, similarities, impacts in the classroom, and utility to education researchers. Our analysis also suggests improvements and new uses. Finally, we propose activity theory as a useful approach in understanding and improving the use of technology in the physics classroom.

Effective teaching requires that instructors are aware of what students know and how they learn. Assessment, particularly formative assessment, plays a key role in supporting student learning when it is used to inform instruction. Though the research literature has many examples of innovative science course reform efforts, few studies have examined assessment within these courses, particularly in courses that employ multiple components (e.g., lecture, laboratory, recitation) in which assessment is carried out by different instructors. The purpose of this study was to understand the way in which information about student learning is disseminated among faculty and teaching assistants (TAs) undertaking course reform efforts in an introductory physics course for nonmajors. Data were gathered through observations of class sessions and interviews with students, professors, and TAs.  We will share a model feedback loop through which assessment data can be used to inform instruction in introductory science courses.

In a class on perception, students, over the course of 3 weeks, constructed an account of blurriness with respect to vision, describing blurriness as occurring when more than one ray from two separate points out in space are hitting the retina at one point. This account of blurriness, however, was just one of many introduced early on in our investigations of the eye. As students worked to model the eye and developed a consensus description of how lenses and pinholes create images, the the separate points in space to one point on the retina idea was refined, gained prominence in discussions and became a stable, useful, and precise concept. This paper explores one students progressive understanding of blurriness, and the activities and interactions that supported the development of this definition.

Research on physics expertise has predominantly focused on cognitive differences between physics experts and novices where the novices are high school or introductory college students and the experts are university physics professors or graduate doctoral students. Most physics expertise studies declare the experts to be physics faculty without justifying this decision. To establish more clearly the characteristics of physics experts, we conducted a qualitative interview pilot study of three university physics professors. The professors each had an hour-long interview where they were about their experiences of becoming a physics expert. We present the analysis of the question, What makes a physics expert? Analysis of the data resulted in the construction of a model of physics expertise, which indicates that one is a specific physics expert first, acquires general physics expert characteristics and then becomes an expert in physics or a boundary crosser.

We propose a process designed to help actors (instructors and students) reflect on their classroom learning environments, and negotiate social action to modify those environs. Usually actors implicitly negotiate their roles in, and expectations of, their classrooms.  However, an explicit process whereby actors list, rank, and discuss their important learning elements, and then rate their classroom with respect to those elements, can shape this negotiation into a cogenerative goal setting activity.  This mediation is useful for continuously identifying and addressing specific targets for classroom reform.  Furthermore, all community members can have the opportunity to be collectively engaged in building a unique learning environment.  Benefits to students and instructors include a concrete method for negotiating a frame shift toward student-centered learning modes.  Advantages to educational researchers include new opportunities to analyze artifacts produced as a result of a collective process.

In research on teaching and learning in upper-division statistical physics, we created a guided-inquiry activity (tutorial) addressing the discrete binomial distribution and its approximation by the continuous normal distribution. The curriculum emphasizes the distribution dependence on N, the number of binary trials, making extensive use of computational software with graphical displays, allowing N to span more than six orders of magnitude.  These activities provide excellent motivation for examining the increasing density of states toward the limit where integration of a continuous density function is required.  Thus, we have an ideal opportunity for students to engage the summation to integration transition of integral calculus.  The tutorial and a revised version were implemented during the past two years. Findings include improvement in recognition that the distributions become increasingly narrowed about the mean with increasing N.  However, significant confusion remains between microstates and macrostates and their roles in determining probability.

Within the context of traditional physics problem solving instruction, major concepts are mentioned but often marginalized by the focus on equation manipulation, resulting in students perceiving concepts as unimportant in problem solving. Additionally, since topics are covered as isolated pieces, students also perceive concepts as unrelated. In response to this disconnect, we discuss the development of a short, animated, web-delivered synthesizing presentation modeled after the common learning resource from the preparation for future learning construct. In the presentation, major concepts of introductory mechanics are structured hierarchically.  More specifically, the presentation is an overview of major theorems and conservation laws in mechanics and the conditions under which they are applied.  It is linked to previous problems solved by the student and intended to prepare students for future learning by illustrating how concepts guide problem solving processes.

Constructing a useful mental representation of physics situations is integral to success in problem solving.  It is known that experts identify/perceive meaningful patterns and/or changes in visual stimuli related to their domain of expertise.  We present data from an experiment using the "flicker" technique, in which teaching assistants for introductory physics courses, students who had finished a calculus-based mechanics course, and physics-na�ve students viewed nearly identical pairs of diagrams that are representative of typical mechanics situations.  The two diagrams in each pair contain a subtle difference that either does, or does not change the underlying physics depicted in the diagram. We present results on how the speed of noticing physics-relevant changes in the diagram pairs depends on physics experience and discuss the cognitive implications of our findings.

Computer modeling is taught in few introductory physics courses. For those in which computer modeling is taught, the student experience is generally limited to the laboratory. We have worked to extend this experience to other aspects of the introductory course, including homework and exams. We present our experiences in developing and deploying this homework sets and the subsequent evaluation of students computer modeling abilities in a set of large introductory courses (N ~ 500).

We report on the initial field tests of Learning Physical Science (LEPS), a new curriculum adapted from Physical Science and Everyday Thinking (PSET). PSET is an inquiry-based, hands-on, physical science curriculum that includes an explicit focus on nature of science and nature of learning. PSET was developed for small enrollment discussion/lab settings. The Learning Physical Science (LEPS) curriculum maintains the same research-based learning principles as PSET but is suitable for classes taught in lecture format. LEPS has been field tested by eight instructors at different universities. In this paper, we describe the adaptation process, the resulting LEPS curriculum, and present student learning outcomes for LEPS and PSET.

Conceptual surveys like the FCI and CSEM are common, and course reforms often have the goal of improving student gains on these surveys.  There exist various approaches to improving said gains, and while some approaches have been accused of teaching to the test, such accusations have generally been well-refuted.  To our knowledge, however, there has been little direct experimentation on whether teaching to the test, even intentionally, has the expected result.  In this poster, we report on a two-semester experiment involving ~900 students where we tried two different approaches to improving CSEM gains in an introductory E&M class.  In the first trial, we gave students many of the questions from the CSEM as Peer Instruction-style clicker questions in lecture.  In the second, we redeveloped parts of our Studio physics curriculum to target CSEM concepts without replicating CSEM questions.  We compare the data from each experimental semester to previous years data.

Our previous work has shown that experimentation with virtual manipulatives supports students conceptual learning about simple machines differently than experimentation with physical manipulatives [1].  This difference could be due to the messiness of physical data from factors such as dissipative effects and measurement uncertainty. In this study, we ask whether the sequence of experimentation with physical and virtual manipulatives affects how students interpret the data from the physical experiment. Students enrolled in a conceptual-based physics laboratory performed both physical and virtual experiments to learn about pulleys and inclined planes.  Approximately half of the students performed the physical experiments before the virtual experiments, and the other half completed the virtual experiments first.  We find that using virtual manipulatives before physical manipulatives promotes an interpretation of the physical data that is more productive for conceptual learning.

We administered open-ended questions to students in an electricity and magnetism class at a private Mexican university to elucidate difficulties with the electric field concept. In the first part of this report, the objective is to compare students responses to electric field questions in the presence of charges and conductors to those in the presence of charges and insulators. In the second part, the objective is to analyze the difference in responses when the context is changed by comparing responses to electric field questions with reference to abstract objects, i.e., point charge, non-conducting sphere; to those with reference to already-used real materials in lab, i.e., charged tape, non-conducting pencil. In the last part, the objective is to analyze whether a guided question helps students to better answer electric field questions by comparing students responses to questions with no guidance to responses to guided questions and the degree of guidance.

Components of a college-level introductory physics course at a large Midwestern university were investigated for the purpose of obtaining a better understanding of the elements that contribute to success of the student in an inquiry-based setting.  More explicitly, this course offers students the ability to learn physics concepts through carefully designed laboratory instructions without a lecture component, as opposed to the more traditional setting where lecture is the teaching method of focus.  A structural Equation Model (SEM) was utilized both to aid in the definition of and relate course elements such as quizzes, exams, narrative learning reflections, and diagnostic tests to interconnections that promote achievement in inquiry-based physics.  Initial findings suggest latent components of inter-student communication and physics aptitude play a strong role in the success of the inquiry-based physics student.

In a course organized around the development of diverse representations, no single mode of expression offers a complete picture of participants understanding of the nature of energy.  Instead, we argue, their understanding is actively constructed through the simultaneous use of a range of quite different kinds of representational resources (Goodwin, 2000), including not only words but also gestures, symbolic objects, participants moving their bodies in concert, and whatever other communicative modes the course invites them to use.  Examples are provided from a teacher professional development course on energy.

Based on learning by analogical encoding, we designed and implemented conceptually scaffolded synthesis problems to induce students to rely on fundamental concepts for problem-solving, an approach frequently employed by experts. These synthesis problems combine multiple topics that are broadly separated in the teaching timeline, militating against novice-like formula-based solutions. Moreover, each synthesis problem is sequenced with two preceding concept questions that share with it the same deep structure. After answering the concept questions and before solving the synthesis problem, students are explicitly reminded to seek the underlying connections. These concept questions, together with the explicit reminder, are used as guided scaffolding. 

A series of studies have been conducted. Specifically, this paper comparatively investigates the sustained effects of repeated training using scaffolded synthesis, un-scaffolded synthesis and textbook-like problems. Results are reported and the advantage and/or potential issues of each treatment are discussed.

Despite instructors best efforts to encourage the use of common sense in physics problem solving, students often treat physics as unrelated to the rest of their lives.  However, students have access to a wealth of relevant physical knowledge that is not explicitly taught in physics class.  I label this external knowledge.  Here, I present a semester-long study examining students use of external knowledge in solving context-rich physics problems.  The data set consists of in-situ audio recordings of students working in groups during the weekly problem-solving session of their introductory algebra-based physics course.  My analysis highlights how the students problem solving strategies and epistemological framing during problem-solving sessions correlate with their use of external knowledge.  The results suggest ways to maximize opportunities for students to use external knowledge in problem solving.

In an effort to study the impact of teaching experience and preparation on the pedagogical beliefs of physics Teaching Assistants (TAs), we investigate the beliefs expressed by TAs following one or more semesters of teaching with the Tutorials in Introductory Physics. The beliefs of TAs mediate the actions they take in working with students, as well as the classroom norms they set for participation in the Tutorial activity. In this work, we build upon existing analytic frameworks to characterize two distinct sets of TA beliefs gathered from pre- and post-semester interviews. We present preliminary indications of coordination between these beliefs and the in-classroom practice of these TAs. We then conclude with implications for training TAs in order to promote more pedagogically sophisticated beliefs at a potentially critical time in their professional development.

While developing inquiry materials on radioactivity, we uncovered substantial student difficulties with thinking of atoms as both sources and victims of ionizing radiation.  Most students in a survey level physics course initially had only vague ideas about the structure of atoms and the roles of protons, neutrons, and electrons.  None invoked electrostatic attraction to explain why electrons stay near nuclei.  Developing new, productive ideas about atoms was nontrivial.

We created inquiry based activities that employ a new simulator (Atom Builder) that allows students to manipulate one atom at a time and observe its behavior.  Student knowledge of atomic structure and ionization improved dramatically but certain basic ideas remain elusive for many students.  

We will present ways of thinking about atoms that students brought to the classroom, and that they developed using the simulator.

We have previously reported on the results of a national web survey of physics faculty about their instructional practices [1].  A subset of 72 survey respondents were interviewed to better characterize how faculty interact with research-based instructional strategies (RBIS), use RBIS, and perceive their institutional contexts.  Drawing from 16 interviews with self-reported users of Peer Instruction [2], we describe what faculty mean when they identify themselves as users of Peer Instruction.  Meanings range from professors adopting the general philosophy of the instructional strategy (or what they believe to be the general philosophy) while inventing how it concretely applies in their classrooms to professors who use the instructional strategy as is, without significant modification.  We describe common modifications that are made to Peer Instruction and the associated prevalence of these modifications.

We present an extensive snapshot survey of student attitudes and beliefs towards the study of physics in the UK, using the CLASS instrument. Data was gathered from a wide range of respondents, from students in their final year of high school prior to university admission, through the range of undergraduate levels at the University of Edinburgh, postgraduate students, postdoctoral researchers and faculty, with a total sample size of N=638. 

Our data indicates a statistically significant increase in the proportion of expert-like responses only at major transitions: those between school and university and the upper undergraduate-postgraduate transition. Both of these increases may be due to strong selection effects. By contrast, the extent to which student attitudes and beliefs change during the course of their undergraduate study (typically 4 years) is much less, with no significant changes between the first and final years of students studying undergraduate degrees.

We use a between-student testing methodology to assess student understanding of Newton's 3rd Law concepts on a weekly time scale. Students were tested both in Mechanics, the quarter in which the material was introduced, and in Electricity & Magnetism.  A significant increase in the number of students correctly answering conceptual questions is seen around the time of instruction, but it disappears by the end of the quarter.  More interestingly, a decrease in the number of correct responses is seen in the subsequent quarter precisely when instruction centers around the scalar topics of electric potential and voltage.  Once instruction returns to vector-based topics (Gauss' Law, magnetic fields, etc...), response scores relax back to their initial values

The engineering physics program in G�teborg attracts very strong students, who consistently (since 2004) score an average around 80% on the FCI during the first week at the university. We have also adminstered the FCI for number of other programs, where the entrance results typically have been around 55-60%. Although female students are  among top scorers in all groups, on the average, they score lower. The gap was unchanged when the original FCI was replaced by the "gender-adapted FCI". To investigate the possibility of a selection bias, the test was also given to a couple of high-school classes. For the  engineering physics students we are now experimenting with a selection of 15 FCI items combined with addifional questions aiming to lower the entrance score. Post-testing after an introductory course, including amusement park projects, showed a normalized gain around 50% for all parts of the test.

The National Research Council has suggested that students should develop four proficiencies in science: know, use, and interpret scientific explanations of the natural world; generate and evaluate scientific evidence and explanations; understand the nature and development of scientific knowledge, and participate productively in scientific practices and discourse.  We emphasize these aspects of scientific thinking in our inquiry-based physics course for prospective elementary and middle school teachers. Because the elementary school curriculum focuses heavily on literacy, we also explicitly integrate physics and literacy learning in this course.  By integrating physics and literacy learning we mean learning to speak clearly, listen closely, write coherently, read with comprehension, and make and critique media resources competently in physics contexts. In this paper we discuss students perceptions of ways they have developed their abilities to think scientifically in this context. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant DUE0633752

From one moment to the next, what and how a teacher teaches may change.  In this paper, I discuss two examples from one teacher, showing shifts in her practice from one moment to the next, within the same activity.  These shifts are characterized by different ways in which she attended to her students ideas.  Common accounts that attempt to explain teachers practice as the result of a unified set of beliefs, knowledge, and goals (e.g., teacher-type) cannot account for these two examples.  While these broad generalizations may be useful for studying broader patterns in large populations, they assume a consistency in teacher cognition that is not born out by the data.  I argue that frame analysis (Hammer, Elby, Scherr, & Redish; 2005) can provide insight into how teacher cognition may be organized- namely that consistency is local and depends on what is going on in that moment.

We present results from an analysis of students shallow behaviors, 
i.e., gaming, during their interaction with an Intelligent Tutoring System.  We have developed a method for detecting gaming based on timings of student actions.  We use this method to analyze student log data taken from six college classes that used the Andes tutor system for homework and test preparation.   Our findings show that contrary to other research, student features are a better predictor of gaming than problem features.  We also find that students engaged in gaming for a significant fraction of their work.

Prior work at CU-Boulder has shown that a gender gap (difference in male and female performance) exists in both the pre- and post-course conceptual surveys, despite the use of interactive engagement techniques [Kost, et. al., PRST-PER 5, 010101].  A potential explanation for this persistent gap is that stereotype threat, the fear of confirming a stereotype about one-self, is inhibiting females performance.  Prior research has demonstrated that stereotype threat can be alleviated through the use of self-affirmation, a process of affirming ones overall self-worth and integrity [Cohen, et. al., Science 313, 1307].  We report the results of a randomized experiment testing the impact of a self-affirmation exercise on the gender gap in Physics 1.  The gender gap on a conceptual post-survey is reduced from 19% for students who did not affirm their own values, to 9% for students who completed two 15-minute self-affirmation exercises at the beginning of the semester.

In previous work, we replicated studies of gender gaps in introductory physics courses using the Colorado School of Mines general population.  CSM also has one of the largest collections of physics majors in the country, providing us with an opportunity to extend our work into non-introductory courses, including longitudinal tracking in some cases.    While our introductory courses are taught in a Studio physics mode, the other courses in our physics major are mostly traditional.  In this poster, we report on the character of the gender gaps in courses throughout our physics major.   Performance gaps are small or non-existent throughout the major, consistent with results from introductory Mines physics courses.   On many occasions, women outperform men on homework assignments.    Despite this generally strong showing, females remain underrepresented among physics majors as compared to the general Mines science and engineering population.

In this poster we examine an often-cited claim for gender differences in STEM participation: cognitive differences on tests of spatial ability explain achievement differences in physics. We specifically investigate the role of mental rotations in physics achievement and problem-solving, viewing mental rotations as a tool that students can use on physics problems. We first look at student survey results for lower-level introductory students, finding a small, but significant correlation between performance on a mental rotations test and course achievement. In contrast, we find no such relationship for students enrolled in the honors introductory course. To understand the role that mental rotations plays in physics problem-solving, we examine how students use this tool on highly spatial physics problems in student interviews and find that mental rotation is neither necessary nor sufficient. These results suggest that the robust sex differences on mental rotation tests are of little relevance for achievement in introductory physics.

The movement of sand dunes in the desert is an emergent process; the overall movement of a dune is influenced both by the random interactions among individual sand particles and by the process of wind adding and subtracting sand.  People often misconstrued emergent processes as deterministic processes containing central causality.  I present a case study of how one person, an adult, who was not an expert in physics, articulated and refined her explanation of the movement of sand dunes.  She began with centralized causality but ended with   an explanation containing the cogent emergent ideas.  This case study is noteworthy in exemplifying the dynamic process of generating an explanation.  The interviewee went through four different explanations at three different levels (macro, micro and mid-level) and concluded with an explanation that simultaneously addressed the movement of sand dunes at all three levels.

Socratic Dialogue Inducing (SDI) labs are relatively effective in promoting students' conceptual understanding of Newtonian mechanics, as judged by relatively large (~0.6) average pre-to-postest *normalized* learning gains on the FCI. In addition, SDI Labs are designed to help students *think like physicists*, e.g., to: (1) appreciate the need for operational definitions; (2) use and interpret pictorial, graphical, vectorial, mathematical, and written representations; (3) design experiments and control variables; and (4) consider thought experiments and limiting conditions. Two examples: (A) In a pre-Newton's-Second-Law-lab assignment, students indicate in words and/or sketches *operational definitions* of crucial kinematic terms such as position, displacement, time, and instantaneous acceleration. (B) For the tablecloth-slip-out trick, students derive an expression for the distance moved by a plate in terms of the time required to pull the cloth out from under it, and are then asked "Is the expression physically reasonable? - consider dimensions and limiting conditions."

In this study, our goal was to determine how students in modern physics course perceived their success and the reasons for the success. We view this through attribution theory. In this theory, Perception or inference of cause is called attribution and focuses on perceived causes of behavior (F�rsterling, 2001; Kelley & Michela, 1980; Weiner, 1974). In classroom settings, examination of students attributions about their success and failure helps to both identify students metacognition and to predict their future success in specific tasks. From a set of 27 interviews at the University of Maryland and the Middle East Technical University, we discuss the attributions of 6 students (3 from each venue) in terms of locus of control and stability. We selected the students to show the range of variation.  It was observed that how students make sense of success shapes the characteristics of their attributions.

Research in many disciplines has used eye-tracking technology to investigate the differences in the visual attention of experts and novices. For example, it has been shown that experts in art and chess spend more time than novices looking at relevant information.  Thus, it may be helpful to give novices more direct access to the way experts allocate their visual attention, for example using attentional cueing techniques. However, not much is known about how experts allocate their attention on physics problems. More specifically, we look at physics problems where the critical information needed to answer the problem is contained in a diagram. This study uses eye movements to investigate how the allocation of visual attention differs between experts and novices on these types of physics problems. We find that in problems that deal with energy, experts spend more time looking at thematically relevant areas of the figure than novices do.

Computational activities in the Matter & Interactions[1] curriculum for calculus-based introductory physics promote the tenets of the curriculum: mainly, the deterministic view of classical mechanics. For systems that are too complex to calculate analytically, computers perform an iterative calculation of the fundamental principles of physics to predict the systems dynamics. An ongoing research project[2] analyzes video data of groups of students who completed restructured computational activities with VPython[3] in a lab setting. These activities were designed to guide student attention on using fundamental principles to repair functional, but incomplete programs. Borrowing a framework from reading comprehension[4], tasks were developed to ask students to read the program code in these minimally working programs (MWPs) and create predictions of the 3D visualization produced by the program. We present an analysis of how students interpreted the program code and created predictions of the visualization for three separate activities distributed throughout the semester.

In physics equations, each symbol stands for a physical quantity, and mathematical expressions define relationships between these physical quantities. How do physicists and physics students make sense of these abstract equations? We suggest a theoretical approach to this question that marries ideas and methods of functional grammar and perceptual symbol systems. In short, we propose that mathematics, as used in physics, shares many identifiable elements with those of the grammar of human languages.  Moreover, these elements seem to play a similar cognitive/symbolic purpose to their equivalent linguistic structures. Consequently, although many mathematical expressions may validly describe a given physics situation, few are contextually appropriate. We present a study revealing how physics students interpret mathematical structure. For example, different forms of the same equation influence students models of the physical reality that the equation describes. We discuss the implications of this research for how students interpret mathematics in physics.

The Novel Prize winning physicist Chandrasekhar(1990) argues that beauty is relevant to the process of science: beauty is a guide, a value that scientists use in their work.  This perspective places an aesthetic experience at science teaching and learning in class.  This also emphasizes the artful side of science.  Our conception of aesthetic experience has relevance to understand nature of science.  This study is designed to explore students understanding of science and analyze relevance between aesthetic experience and understanding of science.  In this study, two hundred two Korean high school students, who enrolled in school of art, participated and answered open ended questionnaire.  The findings revealed that students understand science as an aspect of culture and they tend to explain science based on their experiences in art.

A good understanding of the concept of electric flux is important for developing a functional understanding of Gauss's law. We investigate the difficulties that students in the calculus-based introductory physics courses have with the concept of electric flux and discuss the development and evaluation of a research-based tutorial to help students learn this concept. During the investigation of difficulties and development of the tutorial, we gave students written tests in the free-response and multiple-choice formats, interviewed a subset of students and also obtained feedback from physics instructors who teach introductory physics regularly. We discuss the performance of students on the pre-/post-tests given before and after the tutorial. We find that classes in which students used the tutorial outperformed those in which the tutorial was not used.

Several studies have reported the influence of scientific reasoning on the conceptual learning of students in courses developed with methodologies that promote active learning. Given that learning styles may also influence conceptual learning of physics, it has been conducted a correlational study which has used two different approaches of Learning Styles, the Honey-Alonso and Felder-Silverman models. This quantitative study was conducted in groups using the methodology of modeling in a course of  introductory mechanics in college. To assess the conceptual learning it has been used the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE) test.  The results confirm the strong dependence of learning styles on conceptual learning of physics.

What makes an instructional sequence in physics meaningful to students? Why do some explanations seem more plausible than others? Why is it that an explanation can appear plausible to one student but not to another?  We present a model that addresses these questions.  Elaborating on diSessas (1993) concept of p-prims, we develop a model of explanatory primitives, and argue that different individuals have different sets of explanatory primitives, or assign different priority to the same explanatory primitives in certain contexts. We use this idea to argue that this difference between individuals can account for differences in reactions to a specific instructional explanation, and present empirical data to support this claim. We then use the model to analyze Jim Minsrells (1982) instructional sequence on the existence of a normal force to explain how an effective learning sequence addresses the differences between individuals by evoking a rich set of explanatory primitives.

Prior research has demonstrated how the realist perspectives of classical physics students can translate into specific beliefs about quantum phenomena when taking an introductory modern physics course.  Student beliefs regarding the interpretation of quantum mechanics often vary by context, and are most often in alignment with instructional goals in topic areas where instructors are explicit in promoting a particular perspective.  Moreover, students are more likely to maintain realist perspectives on quantum mechanics when instructors are less explicit in addressing interpretive themes, thereby making such issues part of a hidden curriculum.  We discuss various approaches to addressing student perspectives and interpretive themes in a modern physics course, and explore the associated impacts on student thinking.

As part of an ongoing research and curriculum development project for upper-division courses in thermal physics, we have developed a sequence of tutorials in which students apply statistical methods to examine the behavior of two interacting Einstein solids.  In the sequence, students begin with simple results from probability and develop a means for counting the states in a single Einstein solid.  The students then consider the thermal interaction of two solids, and observe that the classical equilibrium state corresponds to the most-probable distribution of energy between the two solids.  As part of the development of the tutorial sequence, we have developed several assessment questions to probe student understanding of various aspects of this system.  In this poster, we describe the strengths and weaknesses of student reasoning, both qualitative and quantitative, to assess the readiness of students for one tutorial in the sequence.

As part of work on student understanding of concepts in advanced thermal physics, we are exploring student understanding of the mathematics underlying physics concepts. One area in which we have done this is with integration in the contexts of thermodynamic (P-V) work, which is process-dependent, and changes in internal energy, a (process-independent) state function. Physics majors answered paired questions, one in a physics context and the other an analogous integration question stripped of physical context, to investigate whether some of the difficulties identified as physics conceptual difficulties could have origins in the mathematics. We found similar difficulties in the work and one-dimensional integral questions. With state functions, student performance strongly favored the physics version. We also asked the math questions to calculus students, with similar results. Our findings have implications for mathematical roots of some physics conceptual difficulties and for student understanding of, and the overlooked sophistication of, canonical representations.

We present two studies investigating factors that correlate with students and instructors perceptions of problem difficulty. In the first study, introductory physics students and instructors were asked to rate the difficulty of textbook-style work-energy problems. These difficulty ratings are compared and we look for correlations between the difficulty ratings and a measure of problem complexity. We find differences between students and instructors ratings and a correlation between instructors ratings and problem complexity but no significant correlation between students ratings and problem complexity. In the second study, we asked introductory physics students and instructors to rate the difficulty of textbook-style kinematics problems. Additionally, we asked students to provide ratings of their familiarity with these problems and complete solutions. We explore the relationship between difficulty ratings, problem complexity, problem familiarity, and the rate at which students solve the problems correctly.

There is a strong emphasis in physics education research on the use of multiple representations to help students solve physics problems. Students who learned kinematics from the Physics Union Mathematics curriculum* answered a qualitative test question which required them to use multiple representations to explain their answer. Depending on the representation used for grading, different students showed understanding. When we looked at pairs of representations (motion diagram and graph), we found that students were often consistent but not necessarily correct. Based on the patterns in the data we argue that to fully assess student understanding we need to provide students with problems that require them to use at least three different representations to explain their answer.

Recently, some attention has been paid in the literature to the advantages and disadvantages of allowing students to use laptop computers in a classroom setting.  Previous studies have shown that laptops or tablet PCs can be used to promote active learning, but can also be a distraction to students.  [1]  If approximately half of students have access to a laptop and half do not, what impact will there be on student learning in an introductory physics class?  During a recent study, DyKnow software was utilized to facilitate increased student interaction with the professor, to share group work, and to push notes to the students using laptops during class.  The authors then utilized data from student surveys, a focus group session, and student performance data in order to compare the impact of utilizing laptops on student performance measures, and on student perceptions of the course.

I compare the normalized gain on conceptual Newtonian reasoning in a course based on iterative design projects (Learning by Design - TM) to a linear non project based course design in middle school. In addition to pre/post gains, I also measure incremental changes over time and detect a degradation of performance at intermediate times. This is interpreted as an example of U-shaped development, which I argue implies a fairly stringent criticism of stand-alone pre/post testing as an assessment strategy.

The motivation for studying physics decreases towards the end of high school, especially for students who do not want to work or pursue higher education in the technical, which involves the use of teaching and evaluation methods to stimulate interest in physics studies. One of the methods that require deeper thinking, high capacity for interpretation of physical phenomena, great creativity and readiness to study physics than average, is portfolio. For example, learning the concept of energy quanta becomes much easier and more enjoyable for students, if they made a portfolio for this purpose. The student portfolio will lead to another vision of natural light, through the study of interesting physical phenomena, such as external photoelectric effect or Compton effect, revealing light corpuscular`s aspect.
Knowledge, through their own effort and will, is sustainable and help achieve the ultimate goal of teaching: student`s academic success.

Researchers and practitioners routinely use the normalized gain (Hake, 1998) to evaluate the effectiveness of instruction. Normalized gains (g) have been useful in distinguishing active engagement and traditional instruction. Recently, concerns were raised about the normalized gain because it implicitly neglects retention (or equivalently "losses"). That is to say, the Hake gain assumes no right answers become wrong after instruction. We analyze individual standardized gains (G) and losses (L) from data collected at Harvard University during the first five years that Peer Instruction was developed. Over the first five years, we find that gains increased and losses decreased. Furthermore, we find that the difference between g and G-L is negligible for students with higher normalized gains but sizable for students with lower normalized gains. The usefulness of looking into metrics of loss over the course of a semester warrants further research, particularly with different student populations.

We are engaged in a large project to understand the evolution of student understanding throughout the introductory calculus-based sequence. In this poster, we report on the impact that slight changes in question format have on student response to vector subtraction tasks.  We use Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) analysis to analyze students' responses on six very similar questions which vary in context (physics or mathematics), vector alignment (both pointing to the right or opposed), and operation (left-right subtraction or right-left subtraction).  Responses on all questions are generally correct and do not vary by instructional week or even by course.  Context and specific operation do not show significant differences.  However vector alignment is significantly different, indicating that perception or sloppy thinking is a bigger cause of failure than conceptual deficit.

We document the experience of a single participant in a course for secondary teacher professional development in order to track the changes in her thinking about how light interacts with colored objects.  Our two main interests in conducting this analysis are first, to better understand learners ideas about light and color, and second, to observe changes in learners thinking as they occur in real-time classroom events.

Physics laboratories are intended to provide students an opportunity to investigate physical phenomena by making observations, collecting and analyzing data, and presenting their findings clearly.  However, most students lack an adequate preparation and conceptual background to achieve these objectives.  As a pilot study at Cal Poly Pomona, we designed a 20-minute online prelab tutorial on the topics of conservation laws using flash animations, narration, and videos, which contains a brief lesson on the theory, as well as introduction to laboratory procedure and apparatus.  It also includes embedded assessment questions and solutions.  The preliminary data shows improvement in student overall preparation, quiz scores, lab reports, time efficiency, and attitude.

Newtons Third Law is a difficult concept to teach well, and middle school students ideas are mediated by their teachers conceptions as well as their lived experiences. As part of a school-year course for in-service middle school using inquiry techniques with teachers, eighth-grade science teachers studied Newtons Third Law and how to facilitate their students learning of it, and taught their students. In this study, we self-assessed the teachers learning of Newtons Third Law the first year of the middle school program, and they assessed their students using a similar instrument the past two years. From student gains, we compare teachers ideas and their students learning.

One of the goals in introductory mechanics is to help students understand the Impulse-Momentum theorem to the point where they can successfully apply it in many different circumstances.  Typically, these are limited to analytic applications of Newton's second law or the conservation of linear momentum.  Difficulties arise, however, when computational modeling is introduced to students who then must focus on the numerical integration of an open-ended form of the Impulse-Momentum theorem, rather than a closed form solution.  Even ten weeks into an introductory lab sequence which prominently features programing tasks, students are found to have lingering difficulties in reframing their application of the Impulse-Momentum theorem to productively generate computational models.  We will present preliminary data demonstrating the difficulties that emerge as students work to complete VPython programs during a first semester Matter and Interactions lab.

The purpose of this paper is to present a comparative analysis of more than 118 science and education instruments used to measure constructs in the learners cognitive and affective domains, as well as learning progression and learning contexts. The instruments are compared on the following criteria: (a) the construct that the instrument is reported to measure, (b) the number of items in each instrument, (b) the number of dimensions (or factors) each instrument is composed of, (c) the targeted population, (d) internal consistency (e) reliability, and (f) popularity of use (measured in number of citations).  The results show the variability between the different instruments measuring the same or different constructs for each of the compared criteria. The comparison is useful for helping researchers easily choose the appropriate instruments for measuring their constructs of interest.

We discuss student conceptual difficulties with Gausss law observed in an upper-division Electricity and Magnetism course. Difficulties at this level have been described in previous work; we present further quantitative and qualitative evidence that upper-division students still struggle with Gausss law. This evidence is drawn from analysis of upper-division E&M conceptual post-tests, traditional exams, and formal student interviews. Examples of student difficulties include difficulty with the inverse nature of the problem, difficulty articulating complete symmetry arguments, problems visualizing the electric field, and trouble recognizing that in situations without sufficient symmetry it is impossible (rather than difficult) to calculate the electric field using Gausss law. One possible explanation for some of these conceptual difficulties is that students at the upper level may struggle to connect mathematical expressions to physical meanings.

We report results from a qualitative analysis of weekly teaching reflections written by first-semester undergraduate physics Learning Assistants (LAs) at Florida International University.  First semester physics LAs enroll in an introductory science pedagogy seminar and concurrently work in reformed physics I or II labs.  LAs provide weekly teaching reflections that describe strategies implemented, student interactions, and observations from the lab.  This study assessed instructional strategies developed in the LA Seminar as indicated by the teaching reflections.  A coding schema was developed and applied to student reflections by two raters.  Inter-rater reliability was established and differences were discussed to arrive at consensus. Evidence indicates that most strategies persisted throughout the semester after introduction. However, data show that strategies including differentiated instruction and cooperative learning are present throughout the semester, even occurring prior to instruction. Results also point to possible revisions in the instruction of seminar topics.

One hundred eighteen high school and college teachers in Southern California completed a web-based survey designed to better understand the differences in physics classrooms and the reasons behind the teachers choices.  Survey topics included teachers' familiarity and use of research-based instructional strategies, amount of student-student interaction in their classes, their views teaching and interactions with the physics teaching community.  Partial results from the survey will be presented.  Among the findings was that while increased interactions with colleagues correlated with more student-student interactions, increased participation in conferences or reading of journals related to physics teaching did not.

We present an initial analysis of data taken to test the functionality and student usability of an interactive synthetic tutoring system administered online. The system allows students to ask questions and receive pre-recorded video responses from knowledgeable tutors in real-time.  It logs student interactions with a timestamp and username to generate a time-resolved picture of students use of the system.  The tutoring interaction is structured by lessons covering Newtons laws.  Time on-task estimates indicate that students spent about 2.5 hours working through our materials, about as much as intended.  Data also show students reluctance to query the tutor, or that their focus is on other aspects of the system.  This suggests modifications to the system to encourage students to take advantage of its interactive capabilities.  This system provides social and multimedia elements that may, when used as a supplement to classroom instruction, help students better learn physics.

Analysis of the impact of Modeling Instruction (MI) on the sources of self-efficacy for students in Introductory Physics 1 will be presented. We measured self-efficacy through a quantitative diagnostic (SOSESC) developed by Fencl and Scheel [1] to investigate the impact of instruction on the sources of self-efficacy in all introductory physics classes. We collected both pre- semester data and post-semester data, and evaluated the effect of the classroom by analyzing the shift (Post-Pre). At Florida International University, a Hispanic-serving institution, we find that traditional lecture classrooms negatively impact the self-efficacy of all students, while the MI courses had no impact for all students. Further, when disaggregating the data by gender and sources of self-efficacy, we find that Modeling Instruction positively impacted the Verbal Persuasion source of self-efficacy for women. This positive impact helps to explain high rates of retention for women in the MI classes.

Students often make errors when trying to solve qualitative or conceptual physics problems, but the process of deduction that students use when solving physics problems has not been thoroughly studied. To better understand that reasoning, I have developed a framework, based on the "Mental Models" framework in psychology championed by P. N. Johnson-Laird. This "Possibilities Framework" allows us to interpret errors in reasoning as a failure to flesh out all of the possibilities that result from the underlying physical premises. By identifying this failure, potential interventions can be suggested for student difficulties that range from overlooking potentially relevant physical quantities to actively oversimplifying the situation of interest.

Training pre-service teachers requires among other things, content knowledge, pedagogical skills and pedagogical content knowledge. Teacher preparation programs have little, if any spare time to add more courses/activities to their program. However, I argue in this paper that we, as educators, must enhance the amount of physics education research in our pre-service physics teacher training programs. In this study, I analyze the results of two different types of exposure to physics education research from two different groups of pre-service physics teachers in our masters of arts and teaching program. The preliminary results from both of these groups suggest that content specific education research can enhance our pre-service teachers abilities in their classrooms.

One of the results of advances in technology is an increased use of online homework delivery systems. These usually differ in the mechanics of question delivery, student input, grading, and feedback mechanisms. However, regardless of all the bells and whistles, our ultimate goal is to get the students to complete the homework to improve their learning.  In this preliminary study, we investigate the usage patterns and the impact on homework completion and course grade of self awarded homework extensions. The homework delivery mechanism used in the study is a simple locally developed system. The course used is a second semester introductory physics course.

We have developed an assessment of students ability to solve standard textbook style problems and are currently engaged in the validation and revision process.  The assessment covers the topics of force and motion, conservation of momentum and conservation of energy at a level consistent with most calculus-based, introductory physics courses.  This tool is discussed in more detail in an accompanying abstract, poster  and paper by Marx and Cummings.  Here we present preliminary validation data collected from four schools during the 2009/2010 academic year.  Data include both pre- and post-instruction results for introductory physics courses as well as results for physics majors in later years.  In addition, we present evidence that right/wrong grading may well be a perfectly acceptable grading procedure for a course-level assessment of this type.

Quality Elementary Science Teaching (QUEST), a unique professional development program designed for K-6 teachers and special educators that focuses on both content and pedagogy. The program incorporates the 5E instructional model, seamless assessment, and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) as its key components for training K-6 classroom teachers to address physical science concepts in their curriculum. 

Participants in QUEST learn content and pedagogical techniques during the first week of the summer institute, then implement what they learned by working with students during the second week. During the academic year, the program supports teachers through follow up sessions and classroom visits by QUEST staff to help them successfully implement what they learned in their actual classrooms. The program also has an online component for support where the teachers can share their experiences with fellow participants and staff.

One goal of undergraduate research, particularly Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs, is to help students learn to become aware of the importance of ethical conduct.  The Survey of Undergraduate Research Experiences (SURE) indicates that biology students believe they learn more about ethical conduct from their research experiences than physics students.  Motivated by this, we initiated a study of both biology and physics REU students at Kansas State University consisting of pre- and post-interviews regarding their understanding of ethics with results to be compared to the SURE.  This paper presents the students initial perceptions (from the pre-interview) of how ethical issues impact science in general as well as their own specific work.  We also discuss the differences in the interview responses of the two groups.

A relatively large (N=100) upper level quantum mechanics course was transformed to eliminate pre-prepared lectures and ensure active engagement.  Students would complete a pre-reading assignment and graded pre-reading quiz before each class.  During class they would respond to clicker questions with peer discussion and carry out short (5-10 minute) small group problem solving tasks that introduced new material.  There was regular instructor feedback based on observation of student work and questions, but very little prepared lecturing.   All course activities were designed to address explicit learning goals. We measured student attendance, student engagement, and student performance on quantitative (and conceptual) problem solving. In all categories, students in the transformed course significantly outperformed those in the previous iterations of this course which was taught with conventional lectures.

Abstract: Research-validated educational reform has led to classroom models that vastly differ from the structure of traditional lectures, requiring students to adapt to new educational frameworks. We present results of a pilot study that, through the lens of a socio-cultural theoretical perspective, examines the interaction between the instructor and students working in a group. We examined the differences in how students interact with the instructor when the instructors appearance varied between casual and more formal. We found that when casually dressed an instructor more easily takes on the status of a transient group member, which promotes effective group interaction by engaging the group without interrupting their dynamic interaction. This role is achieved by explicit attention to the overt and covert messages the instructor sends students

There is a growing concern in the PER community that physics students should learn more than just physics concepts. Several research-based curricula have been designed to help students develop those higher-level thinking skills, which are not easily assessable by existing assessment instruments. In order to motivate students to focus more on those new learning goals, we need to make the classroom assessments more aligned with the new learning objectives. By restructuring the grading of homework and exams, and redesigning the type of questions given, we were able to convince students to be self-motivated learners rather than superficial grade chasers. At the same time, the new assessment format was able to provide the instructor timely feedback on the effectiveness of his instruction.

In spite of using active-engagement techniques in our classes, big percentage of students can not answer straightforward questions of the type we have covered in class and assigned as homework. We believe that students lack one of the essential components of meaningful learning: self-reflection. How do we engage students in a meaningful self-reflection and measure its implications? We hypothesize that we can achieve that by having students reflect on their homework solutions and doing self-corrections. Incorporation of a  state of the art software platforms such as eProtfolio can greatly facilitate the task, as well as create new lifelong learning skills. We have conducted  an experimental control group design study in a conceptual physics course at Queensborough Community College to measure the impact of such reflective activities on students. We  present the results of the study and discuss its implications.

Our previous research suggested that the major difficulty students have when solving physics problems posed in multiple representations is due to students inability to appropriately activate the required mathematical knowledge in the context of a physics problem. Based on these results, we developed problem sets for each major topic in introductory mechanics. Each set consisted of one or two pairs of matched math and physics problems, debate problems, and problem posing tasks. We conducted focus group interviews with two groups of students working in pairs: a treatment group working on our research-based problem sets and a control group solving isomorphic textbook problems on the same topics. We present a problem set we developed and results from the transfer task designed to assess students ability to solve problems in graphical and equational representations.

We report on the research findings on Singapore secondary one (Grade 7) students preconception of speed:  1) The idea of someone ahead being faster than the one behind is prevalent among students answering the open-ended question, 2) The idea becomes less prevalent when the question becomes more guided, streamlining students' thinking towards the distance apart between two moving objects, 3) While most students were able to choose the correct choice that states that two boys who are running have the same speed because they remain the same distance apart, their explanations do not invoke the concept of speed as distance moved per unit time, and 4) Many students were not aware that in the definition of the average speed of a journey, the resting time was included as part of the total time elapsed. The data were from two batches of students at a reputable school.

An upper level E&M course (i.e. based on Griffiths) involves the extensive integration of vector calculus concepts and notation with abstract physics concepts like field and potential.  We hope that students take what they have learned in their math classes and apply it to help represent and make sense of the physics.  To assess how well students are able to do this integration and application I have developed several simple concept tests on position and unit vectors in non-Cartesian coordinate systems as they are used in upper level E&M.  In this poster I describe these concept tests and present results that show students at different levels (pre-E&M course, post-E&M course, 1st year graduate students) and in different disciplines (physics, electrical engineering) have difficulty using non-Cartesian unit vectors appropriately.

This study utilizes the implementation of research-based learning materials designed to teach students about the physics of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a concepts-based introductory-level physics course.  A progression of activities using hands-on experiments and computer visualizations leads students through the basics of magnetism and resonance, and finally toward a model of MRI.  Here we seek to describe how students understand the basics of resonance and then proceed to make correlations between the hands-on activities and visualizations.  Results show that students had fundamental difficulties with the concepts surrounding resonance, and that it appears to have led to a rudimentary understanding of the visualization and how the two tasks were correlated.  Based on student responses, we postulate what further scaffolding will be necessary for helping the students make more robust connections and a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomena associated with MRI.

Our analysis will highlight difficulties that were more prevalent among students, as well as those that were common for both teachers and students. The implications for development of instructional materials for students and professional development of teachers on this topic will also be discussed.

Although there is much speculation about why students struggle with the use of right hand rules in physics, there is little data that directly addresses the issue. Starting from research in vector understanding and spatial cognition, several factors have been identified as possibly contributing to the difficulty of using physical right hand rules. We will present preliminary results of a study designed to address the degree to which these factors impact student use of a right hand rule.

How do students in an advanced physics laboratory course respond when instructors incorporate different teaching methods? Physics education researchers have explored extensively how students respond (in the form of exhibited learning, attitudinal, and performance outcomes) to different instructional practices in introductory classrooms and laboratories. Studies of student responses to instruction in advanced laboratories, however, have primarily concentrated on the teaching of single physics experiments rather than broader pedagogical practices. In this poster, we describe three teaching methods faculty tried out for the first time in one advanced laboratory course, independent of specific physics experiments: oral assessments; multi-format written reports; and course wikis. We present results on student responses to the implementation of these methods. We engaged in qualitative analysis of multiple data sources, including student surveys, observations of laboratory activities, and student and faculty interviews. Investigating student responses to such instructional experimentation has implications for faculty aspiring to try new methods in advanced physics laboratory courses.

In this work we investigate students� understanding of: 1) vector components and, 2) vector products. We administered a test to 409 students completing introductory physics courses at a private Mexican university. In the first part, based on the work of Van Deventer [1], we analyze the understanding of components of a vector. We used multiple choice questions asking for students reasoning to elaborate on the misconceptions and difficulties of graphical representation of the x- and y-component of a vector. In the rest of this work, we analyze the understanding of the dot and cross products. We designed opened-ended questions to investigate the difficulties on the calculation and the misconceptions in the interpretation of these two products.

During the spring 2010 six students enrolled in an electronics advanced lab worked in pairs on ill-structured capstone projects. They designed electronic circuitry to automate experiments that were completed in a previous advanced physics lab. Some ill-structured features of these capstone projects included open-ended goals, limited guidance from the instructor and the possibility of multiple solution paths. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with both the students and the instructor of the class, before and after the students worked on these ill-structured capstone projects to gauge the participants expectations of the projects before they began and their views about these projects after they were completed. We report on the pre- and post-project impressions of the students and instructors regarding this ill-structured learning experience and the insights it provides us for future implementations of such projects.

Students use multiple methods to add vectors graphically [1], some of them leading to correct solutions, some of them not. We discuss students responses to four different representations of a single graphical vector addition question, designed to elicit different solution methods. These four questions have vectors arranged in either a head-to-tail or a tail-to-tail orientation and either with and without a grid. These questions were administered to several hundred students at two different universities. We present the prevalence of different methods in students responses on the four different types of questions. Furthermore, we describe the types of language they used as well as inconsistencies between students explanations and drawings.

Teacher leadership is recognized as a necessary ingredient to support educational reform. Leaders provide the expertise needed to ensure that reforms promote student learning. The overarching goal of Leadership in Freshman Physics, a Math and Science Partnership (MSP), is to support a cadre of teachers-leaders who serve as advocates for excellence by developing their physics content and research-based pedagogical knowledge. In order to support teachers in developing effective leadership skills, we must first understand their views and prior experiences of leadership. We present results from the initial phase of our study in which we examined teacher self-reported leadership experiences and responses to a Teacher Leadership Inventory. Results highlight areas of inconsistency between teachers activities and what they view as leadership. Insights from our studies can be used to design differentiated professional development experiences to promote teacher leadership.

Innovative STEM curricula such as the ISLE curriculum (Etkina et al., 2007) are centered on active engagement in social learning processes as a means to achieve curricular goals. Classroom practices are highly interactive to facilitate students' development of authentic scientist abilities. To the students, these classroom practices often seem very different from their previous learning experiences in terms of behavioral expectations, attitude, and what it means to learn. Consequently, students must modify their identity as learners in addition to physics conceptual understanding in order to participate productively in this learning environment. Using a survey we developed, we want to assess their 1) expectations of student and teacher roles, 2) self efficacy towards skills supported in ISLE and 3) attitudes towards social learning as well as how these change as a result of their experience in this curriculum. We will discuss the development, validation and preliminary findings of the survey.

Understanding instructors attitudes and approaches to teaching quantum mechanics can be helpful in developing research-based instructional tools. Here, we discuss the findings from such a survey in which 12 faculty members reflected on various issues related to quantum mechanics teaching.  Topics included opinions about the goals of a quantum mechanics course, general challenges in teaching the subject, students preparation for the course, difficulty of teaching various topics, the effectiveness of textbooks, comparison with their own learning of quantum mechanics vs. how they teach it, views about foundational issues, and to what extent contemporary topics are incorporated into the syllabus.

Development of conceptual multiple-choice surveys related to a particular physics topic is important for designing research-based learning tools to reduce the difficulties. We explore the difficulties that the advanced undergraduate and graduate students have with quantum mechanics formalism in one spatial dimension. We developed a research-based conceptual multiple-choice survey that targets these issues to obtain information about the common difficulties and administered it to more than a hundred students from seven different institutions. The issues targeted in the survey include possible wavefunctions, bound and scattering states, quantum measurement, expectation values, Hamiltonian, time-dependence of wavefunction and time-dependence of expectation value. We find that the advanced undergraduate and graduate students have many common difficulties with these concepts but research-based tutorials and peer-instruction tools can significantly reduce these difficulties. The survey can be administered to assess the effectiveness of various intructional strategies.

The University of Colorado Partnerships for Informal Science Education in the Community (PISEC) studies impacts on University and K-12 participants in an afterschool informal science education program.  We continue to explore the sustainability of the University-Community Partnership Model (in which all participants act in their own self interests). To identify sustainable program characteristics, we reviewed all programs funded by the NSF Informal Science Education Grants in the last 10 years, identifying out of school K-12 programs that persisted beyond the term of the grant. While most NSF/ISE grants were awarded to museums /exhibits, television / radio / documentary programs, and conferences / symposiums, a few of the targeted out-of-school programs were sustained and provide insight to such programs success. We present findings on funding statistics of NSF programs and the trends consistent with sustained programs. This work is supported, in part, by NSF # 0551010, the JILA AMO PFC.

In Spring 2010, the Oregon State University physics department instituted a SCALE-UP (Student-Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs) style studio classroom in the introductory, calculus-based physics series. In our initial implementation, comprised of two hours lecture, two hours of studio, and two hours lab work, the studio session was lead by a faculty member and either 2 GTAs or 1 GTA and 1 LA. We plan to move to a model where senior GTAs can lead studio sections after co-teaching with the faculty member. It is critical that we know how to prepare and support the instructional team in facilitating student learning in this setting. We examine GTA and LA pedagogical beliefs through reflective journaling, interviews, and personal experience of the authors. In particular, we examine how these beliefs changed over their first quarter of instruction, as well as the resources used to adapt to the new classroom environment.

We report on an adapted version of the Physics and Everyday Thinking (PET) curriculum.  A unique aspect of PET is its inclusion of special activities that focus on Learning about Learning (LAL) in which undergraduates analyze videos of children talking about science and explicitly consider the nature of science. To create a course that intentionally linked science content, children's ideas, and strategies for science instruction, we augmented the existing PET LAL activities with discussions about teaching and the design of the PET curriculum, and added activities focused on LAL from companion curricula such as Physical Science and Everyday Thinking (PSET) and Learning Physical Science (LEPS). To compensate for the additional time on LAL, we reduced the content activities to only those that directly supported LAL activities and goals. We found that students made significant gains on the C-LASS and expressed beliefs about teaching consistent with the PET pedagogy.

The FCI has influenced the development and acceptance of many research-based pedagogies. Although the FCIs external validity was studied, no data exists on test-retest reliability. We administered the FCI to students enrolled in an Electricity&Magnetism course in the first week of the semester and re-administered the FCI that same week. No mechanics review took place between test administrations. A total of 100 students completed the test and re-test. We find a correlation of r=0.89 between test and re-test total scores, suggesting strong reliability. We then looked at changes between Right and answers and Wrong answers in the test and re-test. We isolate five possible transitions: Right-Right, Right-Wrong, Wrong-Right, Wrong-Wrong_same, Wrong-Wrong_different. Students changed their choices on 31% of items, suggesting weak reliability. Chi-square analyses show the test to be neither completely random nor completely consistent. Using an iteratively constructed probabilistic model, we report the probability for each transition.

In this paper, we present evidence of elementary school students' resources for thinking about ideas that are foundational for learning about energy. Here we provide a case study of a third grade class that follows a responsive curriculum where the lesson is constructed around childrens ideas, and we show that a learning environment focused on the children's inquiries rather than on their arrival at those conceptual objectives can support the activation of those productive resources. That is, their teacher guided them to express themselves clearly, to draw on their own tangible experience, and to make sense. She did not drive them toward particular ideas about energy, but guided them in discovering the beginnings of the concept in what the children invented for themselves. In this way, we suggest, the extended focus on children's inquiry could provide a means for their productive ideas to emerge.

The purpose of this study is to investigate student learning of Newtonian Mechanics through the study of its history and the development of the relevant ideas since the time of ancient Greece.  The hypothesis is that not only will students learn the basic concepts of mechanics, but also will develop a more positive attitude and appreciation for physics.  To assess the students conceptual understanding, we administer the nationally known Force Concept Inventory (FCI) test and for the measurement of student attitude change, we employed the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS); both were given as pre and post-tests.  Additionally, at the end of the quarter, a survey was given out to see how students perceived the different course components and which ones they found helpful in their learning.  This paper will present our preliminary results on such a study.

During the past seven years, Chicago State University, through its Physics Van Program, has worked with many Chicago area high school physics students and their teachers. The Physics Van Program provides both intellectual support and access to laboratory equipment. Intellectual support is provided through a two-week summer in-service course that emphasizes research-based teaching methodology as well as instruction in the use of both basic and technology-based equipment. During the academic year, the Van Program allows teachers who have been participants to engage their students in the program activities by lending them the necessary equipment. Teachers who have been involved in the program have formed a network through which they can share common goals, discuss the conceptual difficulties of their students, and pass on valuable teaching tips. In this poster, we present a description of the program and discuss how the collaborative nature of the project has informed the program's evolution.

A web-based system (InClass) interaction system was used in algebra-based and calculus-based physics classes to enhance students classroom interaction.  The teaching approach primarily incorporated elements of Mazurs Peer Instruction and Interactive Lecture Demonstration. In our implementation, students used personal digital assistants (PDAs) to interact with their instructor during lecture or classroom demonstration. In this paper, we will document the perceptions and attitudes of algebra-based and calculus-based physics students towards the interactive teaching approach and likewise present data on how this approach affected students performance on the Force Concept Inventory.

During the course of a Physics degree, our students spend a long time in the laboratory.  As well as learning how to do practical physics, we also expect them to pick up skills in processing, analysing and interpreting data.  These skills frequently fall into the hidden curriculum: they may not be explicitly taught (instead being absorbed as a side-effect of other activities) and are often not specifically assessed.  So do our students really attain a solid grasp of them?

We have developed and validated a 23-item MCQ diagnostic test on data handling skills in the physical sciences, incorporating such concepts as precision and accuracy, quantitative error analysis, graphical representations and lines of best fit.  The test instrument has been evaluated using a trial cohort of over 1200 students in 10 institutions across the UK and Ireland and has been found to perform satisfactorily on widely-used measures of reliability.

Our initial findings show that overall student attainment in these areas is surprisingly consistent across all institutions, disciplines and educational levels.  In particular, there seems to be no clear development of student ability after the initial year of instruction, with widespread stagnation of student skill levels in the later years of the degree.

We are building in LON-CAPA an integrated learning environment that will enable the development, dissemination, and evaluation of PER-based material.  The centerpiece of our environment is a collection of multi-level research-based problem sets organized by topic and cognitive complexity that are designed to help students learn physics problem solving. These sets are associated with learning modules that contain very short expositions of the content supplemented by integrated open-access videos, worked examples, simulations, and tutorials (some from ANDES).  Our pedagogical emphasis is Modeling Applied to Problem Solving pedagogy [1], but these materials are editable and rearrangeable to accommodate any pedagogy.  To assess students performance accurately with respect to a system-wide standard, we plan to implement Item Response Theory to assess students accurately. Together with other PER assessments and purposeful solicitation of student feedback, this will allow us to measure and improve the efficacy of various research-based materials, while getting insights into teaching and learning physics.

This research investigated how several inquiry-based introductory physics laboratory activities facilitate students knowledge construction and how they affect students ability to apply physics principles in explaining real-life situations.  In this paper, we will document the associations that students make as they go through hands-on activities designed to guide them to discover physics principles and relationships among physical quantities. Our results showed that most students do not readily transfer the target content knowledge learned through discovery-based laboratory activities into a transfer context (e.g. real-life situations).

The number of papers published in the Physics Education Research Conference (PERC) Proceedings has increased dramatically in the past nine years, growing from 28 published papers in 2001 to 77 in 2009. This poster will present observed trends in published PERC papers and their topics, including differences in those submitted for peer review and those published as invited papers. This work is based in part on the PER-Central database, which has cataloged all PERC papers published from 2001-2009.

AAAS [1] has noted that "[m]iddle-school students may think experiments are a way to produce a desired outcome, rather than a way of testing ideas." This predisposition is excruciatingly difficult to counter in both students and teachers. Our intent in an astronomy experiment was to address this problem directly by making and recording regular observations of Sun shadows that would occur over the school year and from which students would find and be able to articulate the annual pattern of the change of Suns position. Students engaged in long term observations of natural phenomena from which they could build understanding.  We present the results of two yearlong investigations and speculate on whether this could be a useful way to address students general misconception of science as a series of 45-minute experiments. Measuring the change in students conceptions is an area for future research.

Physics instructors, by and large, try to avoid confusing their students. However, the truism underlying this approach, "confusion is bad," has been challenged by instructors dating as far back as Socrates, who asked students to question their assumptions and wrestle with ideas. This begs the question: Are confused students simply lost, or does their confusion indicate deeper, more critical thinking than less-confused learners? We evaluated student performance on assignments (i.e. correct and incorrect responses) in an introductory physics course that involved innovative methodologies (peer instruction, just-in-time teaching, and research-based materials) while simultaneously asking them to self-assess their confusion over the material. We probed whether students who said they were confused were correct more or less frequently than students who did not claim to be confused. In this poster, we highlight our results and draw some conclusions about confusion. Is it really as bad as it seems?

The University of Maryland Biology and Physics Education Research
Groups are investigating students' views about the role of physics in
introductory biology courses. The Bio 2010 report emphasized the value of integrating physics, mathematics, and chemistry into the
undergraduate biology curriculum. This poster presents data from an
introductory course that addresses the fundamental principles of
organismal biology. This course incorporates several topics directly
related to physics, including thermodynamics, diffusion, and fluid
flow. We examine pre- and post-attitude survey, interview, and class
observation data to establish how students consider and employ these
physical ideas in the context of their biology course. These results
have broad implications as physics instructors consider reforms to
meet the interdisciplinary challenges of Bio 2010.

The objective of this ongoing study is to refine an instrument to evaluate conceptual understanding and graphical interpretation of a function and its derivative. The instrument is based on a modified version of the Test of Understanding Graphs in Kinematics (TUG-K) which consists of 26 items (7 dimensions). In the new instrument, Test of Understanding Graphs in Calculus (TUG-C), the kinematics context has been removed from the items creating a new context-free version. To favor the translation from kinematics to Calculus, the focus is on 5 out of the 7 original dimensions of the test, giving a 16-item test. A total of 526 students from a university level Introductory Physics course participated in the study. Half of the students were administered the kinematics test and the other half took the calculus test. This work will present data showing preliminary results of the instrument and new directions on improving the instrument.

Do students with the greatest FCI gains and reasoning abilities change how they delineate force from colloquial equivalents any differently than other students?  230 students enrolled in first semester algebra based physics completed FCI pre- and post-tests, Lawsons Test of Scientific Reasoning Ability (TSR) and Mechanics Language Usage instrument (MLU) pre- and post-tests.  The MLU measured changes in usages of the term force via multiple choice and free response items.  Results of the quantitative data were consistent with prior research but also revealed that changes in performance on the MLU bear little correlation with FCI performance (gains, pre- or post-test) or TSR performance.  Presented in this poster are the exploratory findings of the subset of students within this study who demonstrated high FCI gains (>0.60) and elevated TSR scores (> 8/12) yet did not significantly change their usage of force as measured by the MLU.

Identifying the physics principles involved in solving problems is a critical step in problem solving. A major goal in physics education is to help students discern the deep similarities between problems based upon the physics principles so that they can transfer what they learned by solving one problem to solve another problem based upon the same principle. We conducted an investigation in which algebra and calculus-based introductory physics students were asked explicitly in the quiz to browse over and learn from a solved problem and then solve another problem that has different surface features but the same underlying physics principles. Different interventions were implemented for different groups to help students process through the physics principles involved deeply. Students performance on the quizzes after the intervention was analyzed and compared. We will present the findings. This work is supported by NSF.

During the Fall of 2008 a web survey was completed by a representative sample of 722 physics faculty across the United States.  This poster describes how 20 predictor variables correlate with faculty knowledge about and use of research-based instructional strategies (RBIS).  Profiles were developed for each of four faculty levels of knowledge about and use of RBIS.  Logistic regression analysis was used to identify five significant predictor variables.  High levels of knowledge and use of RBIS were associated with the following characteristics: attendee of the physics and astronomy new faculty workshop, attendee of at least one talk or workshop related to teaching in the last two years, satisfaction with meeting instructional goals, regular reader of one or more journals related to teaching, and being female. High research productivity and large class sizes were not found to be barriers to use of at least some RBIS.

In this work we investigate the effect of: 1) the context, and 2) the position of the vectors, on 2D vector addition tasks. We administered a test to 512 students completing introductory physics courses at a private Mexican university. In the first part, we analyze student� responses in three isomorphic problems: displacements, forces, and no physical context. Students were asked to draw two vectors and the vector sum. We analyzed students procedures detecting the difficulties when drawing the vector addition and proved that the context matters not only compared to the context-free case but also, between the contexts. In the second part, we analyze students� responses with three different arrangements of the sum of two vectors: tail-to-tail, head-to-tail and separated vectors. We compared the frequencies of the errors in the three different positions to inquire students' conceptions in the addition of vectors.

In this poster I ask the question, What do we mean by the word community and what is its role supporting freshman physics majors?  I examine this question in the context of The Compass Project, a program that seeks to build community and develop physics critical thinking skills with freshman physics students at the University of California, Berkeley.  Compass works on these dual goals through a summer program, semester-long class, mentoring program, and a number of other smaller components.  Does community mean that our students work together and live together?  Does it mean that we have a set of norms for our classrooms and study groups?  I examine both student interviews and class work toward addressing these questions and consider some of the wider education literature surrounding the word "community."

As part of a larger ongoing study of physics faculty, we report on an analysis of 16 interviews with Peer Instruction (PI) users.  The analyses presented here address the following two research questions 1) How did PI users come to know about PI? and 2) What reasons do PI users give for first trying PI?  In this poster we describe how faculty were first exposed to PI, and the avenues faculty used to subsequently learn more about PI such as workshops, informal discussions with colleagues, reading journal articles, etc.  We also describe reasons that faculty members give for initially trying PI such as dissatisfaction with lecture methods, easy trailability of PI, or their intuitive sense that PI was a better way to teach.  Following a summary of our findings, we discuss implications for dissemination.

A plethora of measurement instruments in science and education are used to measure even the same construct in the cognitive or affective domains of learners. The dilemma occurs when the investigator is faced with limited resources, or is sensible to learners' fatigue, cognitive load or attrition. This leads the investigator to choose one instrument or another to measure the construct of interest. This paper presents the reasons for choosing a specific instrument among many competing ones. Based on another paper submitted to PERC 2010, the following reasons of selection are compared: (a) number of items in each instrument, (b) number of dimensions (or factors) each instrument is composed of, (c) targeted population, (d) internal consistency (e) reliability, and (f) popularity of use. The paper provides an examples of comparing four different instruments that aim at measuring learners epistemological beliefs, and shows how one instrument is critically selected.

Efforts to address the hidden curriculum within introductory physics courses aim  in part  to move students towards more expert-like beliefs about physics and learning physics. In this poster, we examine the correlation between students beliefs upon entering college and their likelihood to continue on to become a physics major. Since 2004, we have collected CLASS survey and self-reported level-of-interest responses from students in the first-term, introductory calculus-based physics course (N>2500). Here, we conduct a retrospective analysis of students incoming CLASS scores and level of interest, comparing those students who go on to become physics majors with those who do not. We find the incoming CLASS scores and reported interest of these future physics majors to be significantly higher than the class average, indicating that these students enter their first college course already having quite expert-like beliefs. The comparative differences are much smaller for grades, SAT score, and university predicted-GPA.

A considerable number of researchers argue that cognitive conflict is a necessary condition of the type of learning that is described as conceptual change. In light of this idea, many of teaching strategies use a count-intuitive demonstration as a means of facilitating a change in students conceptions. However, other researchers argue that cognitive conflict strategies do not consistently lead to conceptual change. Even when students ideas are confronted with contradictory information through instruction, frequently such contradictory information does not result in meaningful conceptual change for a learner. In order to understand this controversy in more detail, we set about exploring how students response to a count-intuitive demonstration. Participants in this study were 96 secondary school students (9th grade) from Seoul, S. Korea. We investigated students preconceptions on the brachistochrone problem by administrating a written test. After the exam, we presented a demonstration that might contradict the current ideas of students who had answered the written test problem incorrectly. We then investigated students responses to the count-intuitive demonstration by using a Cognitive Conflict Level Test (CCLT). Results show that there were diverse responses to the demonstration, especially, superficial theory change was the major response. We discuss how those responses can make the difficulties in the process of conceptual change.

The paper shows the importance of factors to be considered in taking a temporary physics teaching assignment, and factors to be considered by a school to facilitate the teaching assignment.

A functional understanding of a concept in physics connotes the ability to interpret and apply it appropriately. The need to help students learn how to do the requisite reasoning is often ignored in introductory physics, a neglect that often continues in upper division courses. The emphasis in most recent research at the university level has been on the qualitative understanding of concepts, models of student thinking, and problem solving ability. These are all important, but there is also a need to conduct research to guide the development of instructional materials that promote the development of basic scientific reasoning skills (e.g., interpretation of proportions, construction of proper analogies, control of variables, use of limiting arguments, deductive and inductive logic). Examples will illustrate how the study of physics can cultivate ability in scientific reasoning.

When we teach physics to prospective scientists and engineers we are teaching more than the facts of physics  more than the methods and concepts of physics.  We are introducing them to a complex culture  a mode of thinking and the cultural code of behavior of a community of practicing scientists.  This culture has components that are often part of our hidden curriculum: epistemology  how we decide that we know something; ontology  how we parse the observable world into categories, objects, and concepts; and discourse  how we hold a conversation in order to generate new knowledge and understanding.  In order to understand these often-tacit components of our teaching, we need an understanding of how students minds work, how they perceive the activities of science, and how we perceive those activities.  To teach our hidden curriculum we must pay attention to students intuition and perception of physics, not just to their reasoning.

The question of the purpose of education is similar to the question about the purpose of life: it is difficult to keep the answer in mind when one is submerged in everyday routines and minor distractions. But if we stop briefly while grading an exam, preparing a lab, or running a review session and ask ourselves what students will remember 20 years form now, the question and its answer might change completely what we do every day. Our PER group has tried to answer this question and as a result is changing our approach to teaching introductory physics. We still want students to understand electromagnetic induction and thin lenses; but a larger goal is to empower them with the understanding of reasoning processes that help them make independent decisions and solve complex problems in their future lives. I will share the successes and challenges of this work.

The physics freshman laboratory curriculum would appear to be a natural place for students to participate in activities related to critical thinking. However, several elements of the more traditional curriculum, such as an instruction driven recipe-like approach in order to reproduce well-known results, conspire together to send a message that is at odds with broad scientific thinking. It is postulated that this type of formulation of laboratory activities causes a closing of the student "idea space". For meaningful reflection and critique to be a natural part of the learning activities it is necessary to open the idea space by choosing suitable ways of framing the activities in terms of the parameters that control the idea space. In the talk we look at three such parameters that appear to control the idea space: metaphors, audience and language usage.

Developing explanatory models is a central practice to scientific inquiry. When students create and test explanatory models for scientific phenomenon, they develop content knowledge, knowledge of the nature of science, and creative thinking skills. Unfortunately, such instruction rarely occurs in K-12 science. This is, in part, because teachers do not have the opportunity to develop sophisticated understandings of the process of modeling, but also because teaching in this way requires teachers to make real-time instructional decisions that are responsive to students? ideas. This is challenging for new teachers, especially because this decision process is often invisible. In this talk, I will highlight the importance of providing opportunities for sophisticated science thinking for our youngest learners and consider how uncovering the decisions that shape physics courses for teachers may benefit their future students.

The evidence is unequivocal: physics courses influence students epistemological beliefs whether we intend this or not.  Unfortunately the influence is often negative in that students seem to move further away from the epistemic perspective of a physicist. We suggest that the physics curriculum, materials, learning activities, learning environment and assessments all send epistemic messages to our students. These are messages about the nature of physics and physics learning, and how physicists have come to know what they know. Such tacit messages form part of the hidden curriculum (Lin, 1982).  Science instructors often lament that science is too often presented as a rhetoric of conclusions (Schwab, 1962)  but why should we care? Why should instructors concern themselves about anything beyond students understanding of physics content and ability to solve problems? The purpose of this round table discussion will be to explore why one should care about students epistemological development.

I am the principal investigator of a SSHRC grant with the above title. I have developed a suite of activities that seem to get students to evaluate their understanding in terms of two alternative frameworks; Aristotle, and Galileo & Newton. Students become aware that the frameworks relate concepts from different parts of the course and learn to evaluate the frameworks. We plan to develop and deploy instruments that can measure changes in students learning before and after using the array of activities.
Data will be collected in several post-secondary institutions. Interviews will be conducted by research assistants under the supervision of professors on the team. The first year of the program (2010-11) is to involve development and testing of the instruments to be used to examine changes in student epistemologies. 
In this roundtable, I and one of my co-applicants, Tetyana Antimirova would like to discuss what instruments should be used.

We have only our experiences of students' behaviors, verbal, gestural, kinesthetic, affective, symbolic, diagrammatic, etc., from which to imagine what might be their understandings of the phenomena to which we direct their attentions.  When students work alone, they are deprived of one of the necessary components for development, namely social interactions in an intellectually challenging situation.  In these evidence rich settings of students constructing and mutually negotiating for meaning of physical theory for a phenomenon, we have a window on the development of physical theory in their minds. Through this window we can observe the students constructing and testing new explanations for experiences that do not fit their initial expectations about those experiences, the development of physical theory in students' minds. A video of students constructing new understanding will be used to illustrate this perspective.

We have recently created multimedia learning modules for use in an introductory calculus-based electricity and magnetism course.  We have designed these modules in accordance with multimedia learning principles in order to reduce the cognitive load students experience during their first interaction with new physics material.  In particular, we present the material as narrated animations under student control.  Offloading the presentation of basic content to these multimedia presentations has, in turn, allowed the lectures to focus on active learning and concept refinement. The idea behind the multimedia modules is to create visual representations that reinforce the words as they are spoken so that the student can use the information from both their auditory and visual short term memories to construct their understanding.  We will present "in vitro" and "in vivo" studies of the effectiveness of this learning environment, as well as survey data on students' attitudes toward this approach to covering basic content.

Physics education has learned the benefits of respecting the ideas students bring into the classroom, an attitude that we think can and should be applied to beginning physics instructors. We advocate for a perspective of respect towards TAs when conducting TA research and instruction. Such a perspective sees TAs as partners in the endeavor of educating students and seeks productive seeds in their beliefs. A resource framework supports a respectful perspective by focusing the attention of researchers and instructors of TAs on what resources TA already have available to them. It also discourages a view of novice TAs that primarily focuses on their deficiencies as reform instructors.  Thus, a resource framework helps instructors of TAs and researchers approach TAs with a respectful perspective that can foster long-term change as well as help build a more productive relationship between TAs and the PER community.

Oregon State Universitys (OSU) upper-division physics courses re-arrange the traditional content to center around conceptual and mathematical ideas, with the aim of having students engage in authentic practices of physics in an interactive environment. The physics majors introduction to Quantum Mechanics is the Quantum Measurements and Spin Paradigm (Spins).  I am heavily influenced by the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) curriculum that mirrors the goals of these upper-division courses in having students engage in authentic practices of physics. Having spent two years implementing ISLE in the lower-division courses, when I taught the Spins course I modified some activities to align with ISLE methodology.  The constructivist, scientific abilities approach of ISLE helped me strengthen the Spins course by providing connectivity between activities and a stronger emphasis on the goals surrounding preparing our students to think like physicists. My poster will focus on a specific activity sequence I implemented in this course.

Proportional reasoning is one of six dimensions assessed by the Lawson's classroom test of scientific reasoning. Mastering of proportional manipulations is also a basic requirement for students to do well in STEM areas. Therefore, valid assessment of proportional reasoning is crucial for researchers and teachers to develop and implement effective instructions in all STEM education areas.  There are four questions in the Lawson's test on proportional reasoning, with which multiple validity issues have been observed in large scale applications of the instrument. In this presentation, we will report our research on validating the questions and the development of new questions aimed to address the validity issues of the Lawson's test.

Differences in learning gains between interactive engagement and lecture instructional practices have been well documented and yet the ways in which students participate in each of these learning environments are not clearly established. We use social network analysis as one way to establish differences the participation of students in lecture sections and students in Modeling Instruction, a curriculum that uses interactive engagement. One primary difference in the way students participate in the two instructional practices is that students in Modeling Instruction classes form learning communities and students in lecture classes remain isolated. Students in Modeling Instruction sections report 10x greater numbers of ties between students than those in lecture sections, forming richer and more deeply connected networks. We interpret these differences in terms of a participationist view on learning and as an explanatory mechanism for understanding documented differences in learning gains in the two settings.

The Algebra Project, led by R. Moses, provides access to understanding of algebra for middle school students and their teachers by guiding them to participate actively and communally in the construction of regimented symbolic systems.  We have extended this work by applying it to the professional development of science teachers (K-12) in energy.  As we apply the Algebra Project method, the focus of instruction shifts from the learning of specific concepts within the broad theme of energy to the gradual regimentation of the interplay between learners' observation, thinking, graphic representation, and communication.  This approach is suitable for teaching energy, which by its transcendence can seem to defy a linear instructional sequence.  The learning of specific energy content thus becomes more learner-directed and unpredictable, though at no apparent cost to its extent.  Meanwhile, teachers seem compelled by this method to reclaim the rightful place of their students in the scientific process.

The objectives of K-12 teacher education science courses often focus on conceptual learning and improving students overall attitude towards science.  It is often assumed that with the use of research-based curriculum material and more hands on inquiry approaches, without any explicit instruction, student scientific and critical thinking skills would also be enhanced.  I have been investigating student scientific and evidence-based reasoning abilities in a K-8 pre-service science course at Cal Poly Pomona in the last three years.  After recognizing student specific difficulties, I have provided explicit feedback using rubrics to assist students to become more rigorous and reflective thinkers; to use appropriate and accurate vocabulary; exercise evidence-base reasoning; and develop skepticism with respect to their own views.  I will share the preliminary rubrics and report the results.

As researchers and instructors, we use observations of actions, statements, and written work to make what inferences we can about student thinking.  Recent work in PER has emphasized the importance of explicit theoretical frameworks in how and what we attend to when considering such observations.  This presentation will offer the perspective of a physics-oriented PER practitioner for whom theoretical frameworks principally offer informed modes of uncovering student thinking.  In this view, a given framework is a tool for listening (or, more generally, observing) students in a certain way.  The value of the framework rests in large part in its ability to contribute to the design of instructional environments and strategies that move students toward desired learning goals. This perspective will be illustrated through the analysis of video data from a Physics and Everyday Thinking class.

As a researcher, I place a high value on feeling empowered as a key agent of my own learning. As an educator, I place a high value on empowering students as agents of their own learning. In this poster I will ask: how can educational tools be designed and used such that students take credit for what they do and learn? I will use PhET interactive simulations as an example. Educational tools re-structure the world in order to make student learning more efficient. There is always a balance between how much re-structuring is pre-determined for students, and how much is left to student choice. My theoretical bias aims to help students feel both responsible for and capable of exploring and re-structuring the world, hence seeing themselves as key agents of their own learning. I will describe this theoretical framework and how it aligns with my values and respects student agency.

The Paradigms in Physics Program at Oregon State University has adapted a variety of interactive pedagogies to engage students in "thinking like a physicist." �Video recordings of class sessions document what the students and instructor say and do. �This paper discusses development of narrative interpretations of such videos. �Examples are drawn from two detailed narratives of wrap-up discussions during which the main ideas emerged during the discussions rather than during the tasks that the students had been doing in their small groups. The goal of these "compare and contrast" wrap-up discussions was to help the students envision connections among geometric and algebraic representations of the mathematics they would be using during the coming weeks of instruction in quantum mechanics. The purpose of the narratives is to provide examples of wrap-up discussions with commentary about ways in which the instructor was choosing to guide this process.

One physics BIG Idea is cognitive engagement of the transition from discrete to continuum, from quantum to classical physics.  Probability, statistics and entropy are also challenging curriculum components for students.  Some of the issues above are reflected in the mathematical processes of discrete Riemann summation morphing into the integration of continuous functions; e.g., normalization accomplished via integration over probability density.  To help students master these concepts, I developed and twice implemented in upper-level statistical mechanics a guided-inquiry in-class tutorial with assessment homework.  Students are assigned specific tasks prior to the scheduled in-class activity, using MATHEMATICA� (code provided) for calculations and distribution plots to display probabilities for 10 < N < 107 coin flips.  We will engage part of the activity in the graphical sequence intended to help students model an outcome state of overwhelming probability, in spite of decreasing probability as N increases.

Solving problems presented in multiple representations is an important skill for future physicists and engineers.  However, such a task is not easy for most students taking introductory physics courses.  We conducted teaching/learning interviews with 20 students in a first-semester calculus-based physics course on several topics in introductory mechanics.  These interviews helped identify the common difficulties students encountered when solving physics problems posed in multiple representations as well as the hints that help students overcome those difficulties.  We found that most representational difficulties arise due to the lack of students ability to associate physics knowledge with corresponding mathematical knowledge.  Based on those findings, we developed, tested and refined a set of problem-solving exercises to help students learn to solve problems in graphical and equational representations.  We present our findings on students common difficulties with graphical and equational representations, the problem-solving exercises and their impact on students problem solving abilities.

We describe a study in which introductory physics students engage in reflection with peers about problem solving. The recitations for an introductory physics course with 200 students were broken into the "Peer Reflection" (PR) group and the traditional group. Each week in recitation, students in the PR group reflected in small teams on selected problems from the homework and discussed why solutions of some students employed better problem solving strategies than others. The graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants (TAs) in the PR group recitations provided guidance and coaching to help students learn effective problem solving heuristics.  In the recitations for the traditional group, students had the opportunity to ask the graduate TA questions about the homework before they took a weekly quiz. The traditional group recitation quiz questions were similar to the homework questions selected for ``peer reflection" in the PR group recitations.

As one measure of the impact of this intervention, we investigated how likely students were to draw diagrams to help with problem solving.
On the final exam with only multiple-choice questions, the PR group drew diagrams on more problems than the traditional group, even when there was no external reward for doing so. Since there was no partial credit for drawing the diagrams on the scratch books, students did not draw diagrams simply to get credit for the effort shown and must value the use of diagrams for solving problems if they drew them.

We also find that, regardless of whether the students belonged to the traditional or PR groups, those who drew more diagrams for the multiple-choice questions outperformed those who did not draw them.

Innovation and efficiency  the dilemma between these two aspects of learning is at the heart of our perception of what good teaching or learning are. We wish to streamline, speed up, shorten, and simplify both student learning and classroom assessment. If some curriculum "takes too long to get to X," we are unlikely to adopt it. Despite the research on the benefits of engaging students in innovation, there is very little room left for student innovation (including experimental design) in the current educational system, which is primarily based on efficiency.

In this poster we challenge conventional wisdom that prefers efficiency. We show evidence that design and innovation that take a lot of time not only engage students in constant sense-making and prepare them to learn on their own later but, most importantly, help them develop one of the crucial skills that they will need in the future: intellectual perseverance.

Understanding how specific learning environments influence student participation in science classrooms is fundamentally important to physics education research and its efforts at educational reform. Over the past few decades, science education researchers have shown an increased interest in the role that scientific argumentation plays in school science, both as an aspect of authentic scientific practice and as an instructional approach to learning. We report on an ongoing investigation to understand how curricular structures common to physics education shape student participation in scientific inquiry, using student argumentation as a window into classroom participation. In this paper, we provide a brief analysis of students' collaborative arguments during an inquiry lesson on the nature of light in order to illustrate how students' arguments about the physical phenomena interact with the specific claims students make about the lesson, and discuss the impact this has on students' opportunities to participate and learn.

Inventing-with-Contrasting-Cases (ICC) is an instructional method that helps students perceive critical deep structures underlying problems.  This poster delineates three essential ingredients of ICC.  First, the instruction must focus on a deep structure or "big idea" that runs through many areas of physics.  In the examples of ICC we provide, ratio is the big idea.  An understanding of proportional reasoning is necessary for learning many physical concepts such as density, speed, and acceleration.  A second element of ICC is that students "invent" or generate a single representation that captures the big idea.  This representation could take the form of a formula, theory, or graph.  Third, optimal contrasting cases support invention.  Contrasting cases are examples of phenomena that are designed to highlight critical deep features through contrast.  These three design points are illustrated with instructional and empirical examples in the domain of proportional reasoning.

Mathematical reasoning skills are fundamental tools for understanding physics, and proportional reasoning is perhaps the most familiar skill.  Physicists reason this way in the context of nearly every physical quantity. It is rudimentary, yet we know our students often leave our courses without having mastered this important skill. In an ongoing collaboration between Rutgers University, Western Washington University and New Mexico State University we have developed curricular materials and methods for using invention as a preparation for instruction, building the foundation for proportional reasoning in the context of physics. This poster describes "invention sequences" that are based on inventing-with-contrasting-cases piloted at Stanford University School of Education*. We present the materials and how their existence has affected the emphasis of the teachers and students that use them.

Kinesthetic activities are powerful tools for physics instruction. These activities require students to interpret a physical situation or concept with movement and postures - like acting out the motion of a particle based on a graph of its motion. They provide memorable classroom experiences and allow students to embody their conceptual physics knowledge. We will present kinesthetic activities that are used in junior level physics courses and lead a discussion about their implementation and affordances for student learning. In particular, we will discuss the relationship of these activities with sense-making, representational competence, spatial reasoning, and building a community of practice.  This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DUE 0618877.

No instruction is free from the 'hidden curriculum.'  Modeling Instruction developed to explicitly uncover the underlying physical models hidden in a standard physics curriculum. Associated with this curricular reform is a pedagogical reform that enacts the epistemological belief system that Modeling is the central process in science.  As with all belief systems, Modeling embeds features in the instructional practice that are 'hidden'.  In this poster, we consider the implications of exposing elements from the hidden curriculum by focusing through Modeling Instruction, and also what has been hidden by implementing a curriculum and pedagogy with a modeling epistemological foundation.

This study seeks to answer the question, "How does learning happen?" The context was a Physics and Everyday Thinking course, a highly interactive physics curriculum in which students collect and analyze data as a means by which to establish scientifically accepted ideas. Two focus students were video taped throughout a unit on magnetism as they transitioned through 7 different representations of their model of magnetism. Evidence also shows that their discourse and model-building practices developed greatly throughout the unit. The findings of this study are framed in terms of Sfard and Laive's (2005) notion of the objectification of discourse as a definition of learning.  I will demonstrate that the learning of physics that was observed in this study resulted from the students objectifying their discourse away from the self and its communication with other people and toward the self in relation to the human-independent world of magnetic phenomena. Evidence is used to demonstrate how elements of the curriculum, classroom norms, and the discourse itself were instrumental in the learning that took place for these students.

In research on disciplinary knowledge, language is often treated as a communication medium rather than as a legitimate part of cognition. Both language and concepts are involved in the learning process, yet they are almost impossible to analytically distinguish from one another. I tackle this problem head-on using the notion of objectification of discourse to define the development of conceptual understanding. Objectification of discourse is the process that begins as an interpersonal affair and as a result, turns into a matter of one's relation with the human-independent world. This Vygotskian perspective integrates elements of a behaviorist perspective and can shed light on how learners come to understand, and participate in, the Discourse of physics. Using a video snippet from a Physics and Everyday Thinking class, I will illustrate early phases of this learning process and demonstrate the interpersonal focus of students' discourse and highlight how this leads to scientific, mechanistic reasoning.

The ability to carry out complex analytical calculations is an important skill for a physicist. As an activity in a first semester, upper division electricity and magnetism course, students work in groups during class to develop an integral expression for the magnetic field in all space due to a ring of charge rotating about its axis. This is a direct but complex application of the Biot-Savart Law, requiring students to break the problem into pieces and employ a number of physics concepts. The problem also presents an opportunity for students to draw on analogous earlier work, including finding the electrostatic potential and field due to a ring of charge. This poster will explore the "physics thinking" required to solve this problem, and how the activity and instructor engage students in that thinking.

At Oregon State University, the introductory calculus-based physics sequence utilizes social engagement as a learning tool. The reformed curriculum is modeled after the Interactive Science Learning Environment from Rutgers University, and makes use of Peer Instruction as a pedagogical tool to facilitate interactions.  Over the past two years we have utilized a number of techniques to understand how to facilitate activities that promote productive discussion within the large lecture classroom.  We specifically seek student discussion that goes beyond agreement on conceptual questions, encouraging deeper discussions such as what assumptions are appropriate, or how different assumptions would change the chosen answer to a given question.  We have quantitative analysis of engagement based on video data, qualitative analysis of dialogue from audio data, and classroom observations by an external researcher.  In this session we share a subset of what we have learned about how to engage students in deep-level discussions during lecture.

Mathematics, the queen of the sciences, rules its domains with a strict, deductive hand---at least, that is what our students get taught explicitly.  Mathematics courses, for example, come packed with definitions, lemmas, and theorems.  At best, students learn to follow proofs made by others.  Seeing mathematics as a field where any mistake is fatal, students cannot imagine using mathematics to express or discover patterns in the world.  The explicit focus on rigor teaches rigor mortis. 

After years lamenting this problem, I created "Street-fighting mathematics", an applied-mathematics course at MIT whose explicit lesson is courage.  It teaches six reasoning modes useful across science and engineering: dimensions, extreme cases, lumping, pictorial reasoning, successive approximation, and reasoning by analogy.  I will illustrate each reasoning mode with examples---and, as a pacifist, encourage you to use these tools, and others that you find, to produce bold mathematical street fighters.

There has been substantial research on students' abilities to engage in a scientific discussion and think critically in a science class.  I will discuss a view that scientific critical thinking is not something innate, but has to be learned through a socio-cultural process.  It involves inductees (students) becoming increasingly involved in a specialized discourse that has fixed rules, but whose rules are seldom made explicit within the physics community that uses them.  I will then discuss one method of making these "discourse rules" of physics explicit for students by using formative assessment rubrics.  I will provide some examples of how these rubrics can be implemented, and examine their effectiveness in a physics class.

Many upper-division courses at the University of Colorado now regularly use peer instruction in the form of clicker questions during lectures. Particular attention has been paid to developing and implementing clicker questions in junior-level E&M and Quantum mechanics. These transformed classes are moderate in size (~20-60 students), and largely follow traditional local norms of syllabus and content coverage. However, our faculty have recently articulated broader learning goals (e.g developing math-physics connections) expected for physics majors in these courses. The design and use of concept tests is aligned with these goals, and has altered the dynamic of our classes. Coupled with other course transformations, we find measurable improvement in student performance on targeted conceptual post-instruments. Here, we discuss classroom logistics of upper-division clickers, design of clicker questions, aspects of student engagement facilitated by concept-tests, and measures of and challenges to sustainability of this activity.  This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DUE 0737118.

The practice of using rich records of naturally occurring activities as evidence of student knowledge promotes and supports a particular point of view:  that learning and expertise show best in what students do and say to learn together.  The "cells" of this talk and action are events on the order of one second long.  The meaning of such events is made evident in interactional sequences on the order of minutes.  Our particular analytic interest is in the ways in which our sensorimotor systems shape, generate, display, and limit the kinds of things we think about, and in how material artifacts shape the substantive and interactional aspects of students' activity.  In this view, students that just sit still and talk to each other aren't doing much.  We analyze a sequence of medium richness, in which the construction of a whiteboard structures students' thinking about energy.  In this sequence of a few minutes, the embodiment of cognition is apparent in what the participants say, but social constraints limit their use of their bodies.

Identifying the physics principles involved in solving problems is a critical step in problem solving. A major goal in physics education is to help students discern the deep similarities between problems based upon the physics principles so that they can transfer what they learned by solving one problem to solve another problem based upon the same principle. We conducted an investigation in which more than 800 algebra and calculus-based introductory physics students were asked explicitly in the quizzes to browse over and learn from a solved problem and then solve another problem that has different surface features but the same underlying physics principles. Different interventions were implemented for different groups to help students process through the physics principles involved deeply. Students' performance on the quizzes after the intervention was analyzed and compared. We will present the findings. This work is supported by NSF.

The Physics Program at Chicago State University is engaged in projects that focus on student content understanding, attitudes, and reasoning skills.  Assessment results are reported to a number of stakeholders, including the funding agency, the University, the physics faculty, the physics education community, and the CSU students.  It is naive to think that each of these stakeholders shares a common vision about the goals and objectives of the project.  In addition, it is naive to believe that each assessment focus serves the interests of our students.  In many cases a focus on the interests of an individual stakeholder, or even multiple stakeholders can cause us to overlook the development of many of the qualities we value in our students.  We present a variety tools that focus on our diverse assessment goals.  Participants at the session will discuss how the different stakeholders would view each of these tools and its results.

Physicists reason about proportions in a variety of contexts without conscious effort.  Students, on the other hand, tend to reason about ratio operations based solely on memorized algorithms.  They struggle to match the appropriate algorithm to the situation encountered.  If asked to justify or explain an operation, they not only are unable to do so, but often do not even understand what is being asked.  Further, students seldom reason consistently from context to context the way a physicist does. In light of these findings, describing the classroom work of students as "proportional reasoning" may be a misnomer.  One strategy that can be used across contexts to justify mathematical operations and check them is "package reasoning," described by Arons, McDermott, and others.  At Western Washington University, we are investigating how students engage with package reasoning, including what productive footholds might be available to them, and what features present particular difficulty.  In this poster, results from written questions will be used to illustrate student thinking.

When multiple people engage in conversational interaction, either casually or with an well-defined goal, that interaction is governed by a set of tacit rules that give rise to certain regularities in the conversation. There is a rich tradition of research that examines the moment-to-moment dynamics of naturally occurring talk-in-interaction - such as everyday conversation, tutoring, interviewing, and large group classroom discourse - to identify these rules of discourse. Knowing these rules for different interactions facilitates comparison across forms of talk and identification of continuities between them. In this work I use techniques from Conversation Analysis to understand the rules of discourse that govern the interaction of two students as they generate an explanation for magnetic attraction. Doing so allows me to examine which other conversational forms the interaction resembles, and thus speculate about which patterns of participation may either support or inhibit their learning in this interaction.

This poster will present examples of tasks, focused on the concept of force, that can be used to identify students' initial (natural) thinking and then facilitate comparing and contrasting their ideas with the physically accepted ideas. Doing this with these TIPER tasks can help students make sense of the physics they are studying, rather than just memorizing the physically accepted ideas.  We will present several related tasks that deal with different aspects of the force concept, e.g., force proportional to velocity, force as a property of an object, force calculated from mass times acceleration and examples of student responses that indicate such thinking.  We will also present ideas for how to use nTIPERs.

A major aspect of educational reform in college physics has been the design of learning environments that improve student understanding and attitudes toward science. One of the most direct impacts that these reforms have is in how they restructure students' participation in and around the physics classroom, including how and where students interact with peers, instructors, technology, and curricular materials. This session focuses on research approaches that aim to capture and characterize the nature of students participation within various educational spaces, which represent reforms common to physics education. In discussing their studies, presenters will be asked to reflect upon how their research frameworks, methodologies, and findings contributes to conceptualizations of students progress and successful programs in ways that go beyond traditional measures.

Learning physics is challenging. There are only a few fundamental
principles of physics that are condensed in compact mathematical forms.
Learning physics requires unpacking these fundamental principles and
understanding their applicability in a variety of contexts. Cognitive
theory can be employed to design instruction and facilitate thinking and
learning in the physics classroom. In this session, we will showcase
examples of instructional strategies based upon the principles of
learning that have been effective in improving students' learning. These
approches include helping students learn physics via analogical reasoning,
helping students reflect upon problem solving with peers, a new use
of multimedia learning in introductory physics, "nTIPERs" to help students
unpack aspects of Newtonian dynamics and facilitating students' problem
solving across multiple representations in introductory mechanics.

This targeted poster session will focus on projects involving the use of curriculum materials as well as class discussion techniques that will enhance student critical and reflective thinking skills.  How can we facilitates a learning environment to assist student to think and talk like a physicist: pursue relevant and reliable knowledge, ask insightful questions, gather relevant information, reason logically from this information, and come to scientific conclusions about the world?  We will report on our efforts, success, and challenges in engaging students in such activities.

Despite a significant emphasis on ratio strategies in precollege mathematics, many students have difficulty reasoning about ratio quantities in college physics. Research shows that students who struggle with simple questions that involve proportional reasoning tend to be less successful in introductory physics classes1. This should hardly be surprising: the introductory course makes extensive use of proportional relationships between physical quantities in increasingly abstract contexts, and we teach assuming that students understand the algebraic representations and the proportionalities they imply.

This session brings together current work on student thinking and learning about proportions. Well explore the mismatch between our expectations and how well students actually reason about proportions, some productive and unproductive ways students reason about ratio quantities in physics, an instructional method that promotes proportional reasoning, and its implementation in college physics courses.

An invitational interactive poster session

This interactive poster session will lead a community discussion around two major themes: 1) what are ways and models for us to enact and make explicit our efforts to address the hidden curriculum (beyond standard content learning) in physics classes, and 2) what barriers are faced in doing so.  We will emphasize how we might take responsibility for what actually happens in the classroom, as well as the historical and institutional resources and barriers that we face. Four posters will highlight the variety of scales and approaches that may be used to address the hidden curriculum and serve as a focal point for our collective discussions. Be prepared to share your own successes and challenges.  We will begin discussions by focusing on our roles and goals as educators, and will happily draw on theory and practice alike.

Education research is highly value laden. [1] This session focuses on the issue of respect for the subjects of research, for instance students. Theoretical frameworks in education can influence which data is collected and analyzed, as well as how that data is interpreted.  We assert that both theories and methods in education research entail a variety of values, and hence attitudes toward students. We will ask: how do theoretical frameworks in PER align with our morals and personal values? And, how might morals and personal values influence our choice of theoretical framework? The presenters will illuminate and confront the relationship between their personal values and research, particularly attitudes toward and treatment of students.

In this targeted poster session cum research working group, curriculum developers will each present their favorite upper-division activity to small groups of session participants. The participants will be asked to identify aspects of the activity that engage students in thinking like a physicist, the in-class actions of the instructor that foster this skill, and the types of resources that students must employ when working with the materials. Then we will compare the activities, looking for common curricular structures and hidden curriculum goals, the differing affordances of different activities, and hopefully, at the end, a rich description of what thinking like a physicist might mean and how we can foster this capability in our students. A research paper summarizing the sessions conclusions will be written for the proceedings. (Yep, expect videotaping and IRB forms!)

This workshop will focus on the use of intelligent tutor systems in a classroom setting to study student meta-cognition and affect. We have been using a tutoring system to study gaming behavior (that is, attempting to succeed in a learning environment by exploiting properties of the system rather than by learning the material) as students work on introductory physics homework problems.  Gaming behavior can be explained by either student affect (e.g., frustration or lack of motivation) or meta-cognition (e.g., "reading hints won't help me learn").

Join us as we: 1) survey research methodologies for studying affect and meta-cognition, listing their strengths and weaknesses; 2) present some relevant studies of meta-cognition and affect using intelligent tutor systems as an experimental probe; 3) conduct a hands-on introduction of the new version of our physics tutoring system, Andes, that allows natural language conversation through chat; and, 4) brainstorm possibilities for future studies.

Scientific, critical, and reflective thinking are processes that unfold as students learn together.  Ideally, students collaboratively construct ideas through the use of a wide range of representational resources. At Seattle Pacific University, "embodied learning activities," in which we deliberately arrange for human bodies to symbolize entities in physical phenomena, are playing an increasingly important role in the instruction that we design and study.  Students communicate their ideas not only through talk, but also body positions, movements, uses of objects, gestures, looks, and so on.  Video documentation of such dynamic multi-modal representations offers the chance to develop our professional vision as well as our understanding of what constitutes scientific reasoning processes.  In this workshop, participants will work closely with short episodes of videotaped classroom activity in order to engage with the theoretical and practical issues that are raised by fine-grained qualitative analysis. Please bring a laptop and headphones if it's convenient.

Details of a hidden curriculum can be discovered by studying the intentions of the instructors and the actions of the students.  This workshop will present research techniques that we use to target and uncover aspects of this curriculum in the context of problem solving.  We will introduce the development, use, and analysis of interviews based on authentic artifacts to probe the factors that shape instructors intentions.  We will also introduce the use of an analysis rubric for written problem solutions to determine if student actions reflect these faculty intentions.

Transferring physics principles from worked examples to new problems can be very hard for students, since they often tend to memorize math manipulations only. Elaborating verbal explanation of the meaning behind math expression often does not seem to help. Therefore, we decided to focus on visual perception. Based on knowledge from grounded cognition research, perception should be more powerful in conveying meaning. We designed several animated multimedia solutions for some difficult problems according to principles derived from grounded cognition, and compared their ability to improve transfer with two very similar animated solutions that contain equivalent spatial information but lack critical perceptual elements. The perceptually rich (good looking) solutions turn out to significantly improve transfer of physics principles, especially when the target problem involves much abstract logical reasoning, and is very different from the example in terms of surface feature.

We present Implicit Action, a discourse management tool, through a qualitative video analysis of a Florida International University Modeling Instruction Introductory Physics I class. Implicit Action in Modeling Instruction is where instructors deliberately create intellectual space in which students ideally see value and need for the construction of new classroom norms and tools that are productive in developing a learning community. This space is created by the implications expressed through the instructor's deliberate actions. Discourse Management is a technique to moderate student discussion in Modeling Instruction classes at the university level that was initially described by Desbien. Implicit Action is one of 9 Modeling Discourse Management tools that we have identified. By means of qualitative analysis we illustrate the effectiveness of Implicit Action in implementing Modeling Pedagogical Theory.

The normalized gain, g, is among the most widely- and easily-used metrics in physics education research, particularly as it is applied to the Force Concept Inventory (FCI).  However, its ease and ubiquity mask several pitfalls associated with the metric, particularly when it is used to directly compare a small number of courses.  Specifically, these pitfalls are: the ambiguities between class and student average gain, the tendency not to report error margins, the effect of losses in initially high-scoring populations, and the extent to which details about classes are washed out by reporting a single number.  Here, we extend the work of others by highlighting these pitfalls using data collected from over 12,000 students in several universities.  Ultimately, we propose an alternative metric that assesses the rate of Newtonian thinking in a class, which is more closely aligned with the description of the FCI suggested by the survey authors.

A widely used assessment tool for Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs is the Survey of Undergraduate Research Experiences (SURE). [1]  A comparison of the SURE responses given by summer researchers in physics and biology in 2009 showed a difference on the perceived benefit toward understanding the research process.  In an attempt to understand this difference entrance and exit interviews on the topic were conducted with the students from both a physics and a biology REU program in the summer of 2010.  Both groups also completed the SURE. Analysis of the interview data and the SURE results will be discussed.  The REU programs are supported by grants from NSF: for physics, PHY-0851599 and for biology, DBI-0851835.

Changes to the physics instruction for our pre-service middle level science teachers began in Fall 2010.  The core of those changes has been the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE).  This initial implementation of an ISLE based curriculum provided an opportunity for qualitative investigation.  Students were asked a complex question requiring multiple representations and higher order thinking on their end of the quarter exam.  This poster will discuss the first iteration of the course, the question with student responses, and implications for further refinement of the use of ISLE in the pre-service teacher physics content courses.

A large-scale assessment was conducted to assess the effectiveness of implementing lecture and lab interventions in increasing students' understanding of physics concepts and problem solving skills. Standardized conceptual and problem-solving tests (i.e., FCI & MBT) were administered to algebra-based and calculus-based introductory physics students over the course of multiple semesters. A 2 (lecture intervention: interactive engaged classrooms vs. non-interactively engaged classrooms) x 2 (lab intervention: traditional cookbook labs vs. reformed research-based labs) analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted. Possible synergism between the two interventions will also be discussed. A multiple regression analysis was performed to investigate the roles of students lab grade and TA effectiveness, as measured by RTOP, in students learning outcomes (i.e., FCI post scores, FCI gain scores, & MBT post scores).

Self-efficacy is often described as a person's belief in her/his ability to accomplish a specific task, and is both content and context dependent. Self-efficacy is both informed by past performance (of the individual and of those considered to be peers), and can impact current performance levels.  This may be especially important for female students in science, who tend to drop out of science classrooms with much better performance records than their male counterparts.  Ethnic minorities are also under-represented in STEM fields.  Self-efficacy beliefs for both female and minority students informs course-taking patterns and career choices.  Work has been underway to develop an instrument to examine self-efficacy beliefs of students on their problem solving abilities in physics, paralleling work in math self-efficacy literature.  Analysis of student self-efficacy ratings  on physics problem solving tasks as they correlate with performance measures will be presented.  Differences by gender and ethnicity will also be analyzed.

Student success in a Physics degree has been shown to depend on more than just performance in course assessment; important additional factors include student attitudes and beliefs about their subject. We have used an instrument (CLASS) that measures how student epistemologies evolve over the course of their undergraduate degrees. Our previous work has sampled a cross-section of students across the Physics undergraduate programme at Edinburgh in a given academic year, and found that student attitudes and beliefs remain essentially static. Here, we present fully longitudinal data collected over the past three years, where we track the evolution of attitudes and beliefs of one group of students. We find broadly similar results: attitudes and beliefs remain surprisingly consistent over time. This suggests that a cross-sectional or pseudo-longitudinal study (collecting snapshot data in one year) is a valid methodology, rather than necessarily having to wait several years to accumulate fully longitudinal data.

The ability to work with graphs is a necessary skill in all of the sciences, yet students still struggle with it.  Previous graph-related problems in LON-CAPA required students to pick the correct graph from a set of graphs or infer data from a given graph.  A new problem type has been developed in LON-CAPA that allows students to input (draw) graphs for themselves, in response to a given textual (or formulaic) description.  These graphs are then checked by the server, which determines whether or not the student submitted graph is correct or incorrect.  A study is underway to test the effectiveness of this approach.

We report findings of a study that investigated the features of student-initiated questions in a general introductory physics class. The questions were extracted from a small group, collaborative peer instruction learning environment. The learning environment was chosen because students freely construct dialogue in the genre of questions in such a setting.  We gained insight into the knowledge construction process by capturing and transcribing questions that arose as students i) tried to understand new ideas and ii) tried to deepen their understanding of already learned ideas. We observed, transcribed, coded and sorted the student-initiated questions for analysis. A preliminary finding is a language pattern suggestive of a questioning hierarchy. We coded questions in 3 key categories; strengthening, deepening, and extending understanding. A finer structure of hierarchy was identified by sorting on specific linguistic forms that students used, such as causal statements, counterargument, and metaphor.

The Physics and Everyday Thinking (PET) curriculum is based on educational research and consists of carefully sequenced sets of activities intended to help students develop physics ideas through guided experimentation and questioning with extensive small group and whole class discussion.  A high school physics teacher has adapted and implemented the PET curriculum in two urban high schools with the aim of removing barriers that typically limit access to the physics curriculum. Though PET was not designed for secondary physics students, this teacher has worked closely with physics education research faculty and graduate students to simultaneously implement and investigate the impact of PET on urban high school students physics learning. Preliminary results indicate that an adapted version of PET has great potential to provide greater opportunities for access and success in understanding physics as well as the nature of science.

Studies tend to focus on the resources that students activate and utilize while solving a given physics problem. However, few studies explore how students relate a given resource such as an equation, to various types of physics problems and contexts and they ascertain the meaning and applicability of that resource. We explore how students view physics equations, derive meaning from those equations, and use those equations in physics problem solving. We adapt Dubinsky and McDonalds description of APOS (action-process-object-schema) theory of learning in mathematics, to construct a theoretical framework that describes how students interpret and use equations in physics in terms of actions, processes, objects, and schemas. This framework provides a lens of how students construct their understanding of physics concepts and their relation to equations. We highlight how APOS theory can be operationalized to serve as a lens for studying the use of mathematics in physics problem solving.

Integration is widely used in physics in electricity and magnetism (E&M), as well as in mechanics, to calculate physical quantities from other non-constant quantities. We designed a survey to assess students' ability to apply integration to physics problems in introductory physics.  Each student was given a set of 10 problems, and each set of problems had two different versions; one consisted of symbolic problems and the other graphical problems. Some students were given symbolic problems before graphical problems and others were given the problems in the opposite sequence. The purpose of this study was to investigate students skills in solving integrals they had learned after completing first semester mechanics compared to their skills after completing E&M in the second semester. We also investigated differences between the two sequences of problems.  The results from this integration survey will be presented and discussed.

Development of students problem-solving ability is commonly cited as a primary goal in introductory physics courses.  However, there is no broadly agreed upon definition of what is meant by problem solving.  Most physicists want students to successfully apply a logical yet flexible approach to solving real-world problems significantly different from any they have seen before.  Still, many introductory instructors are primarily concerned with how successfully and thoughtfully students solve standard textbook-style problems.  We report on our continuing efforts to construct and validate a 13-item survey to help assess students' abilities at solving textbook-style problems in the domains of Newtons Laws, momentum, and energy. Since the Fall of 2009, we have been beta-testing this instrument on introductory physics students (pre-instruction and post-instruction) at several institutes and on a pool of experts. In this poster, we will present details of the survey instrument, its administration, and some results from our beta-tests.

We discuss the assessment of a laboratory-based, algebra-based physics course, taught in an inquiry-based environment without a text. The course was designed 10 years ago and never fully assessed. The materials, developed with funding from two NSF grants (1), began as a modification of Workshop Physics (2) and evolved to incorporate materials designed for other populations (engineering students, pre-service teachers), modifying and adapting those materials for students in the algebra-based physics course and integrating them with our own materials. It is taught in an inquiry-based environment, with the students working through the materials, performing experiments, developing models (both qualitative and mathematical) and periodic Socratic dialog discussions with the instructors.  We have now assessed the course as part of a large-scale departmental assessment, using conceptual inventories, written pre- and post-tests and scientific attitude surveys, such as CLASS. We present the results and discuss the need to develop more comprehensive assessment instruments.

We are investigating interactions with student-driven, multi-level homework as part of our Integrated Learning Environment for Mechanics.  Student-driven means that students choose their assignment from a set of easy (fewest points), medium, and hard (most points) problems subject to accruing a specific number of total points.  Problem levels were determined a priori based on the cognitive load of the required tasks [1] and our opinion of overall challenge.  We are assessing student interactions and performance on these problems in a number of ways: item response theory, time on task, and choice of level. We will present our findings and discuss further studies of the impact that multi-level, student-driven assignments have on students learning.

In schema-based theories of cognition, vertical transfer occurs when a learner constructs a new schema to solve a transfer task.  Vertical transfer is interesting to study, but difficult to measure.  Did the student solve the problem with the desired schema or through a procedural heuristic?  Perhaps the problem cued the student to use certain resources without knowing why.  In this paper, we consider some of the dilemmas and trade-offs encountered in the process of problem design.  Although problems are often published as finished products, we look inside the box.  We map out the problem design space for some problems in calculus-based physics.  Free-response written or verbal assessment is crucial in measuring vertical transfer, but a quantitative problem can complement a qualitative investigation.

In this study, students completed a questionnaire immediately following all quizzes and tests reflecting on several aspects of test preparation: how well they thought they did and why, how they knew what to study, what specific activities helped them prepare for the assessment, and what they will do differently to prepare for the next assessment.  Responses were analyzed for patterns in student language and metacognitive statements, examining trends in both individual students and classes over time. Responses were also correlated to assessment data and changes in instructional strategies.  Results from this study provide insight into what students do to prepare for a quiz or test, and also reveal trends in how students interpret the purpose of reflective activities.

For several years, the physics department at Spelman College has used project-based instruction as a central focus of our curriculum at all levels. This presentation will describe our work on the second-semester introductory course, in which we have moved all of the circuits material to a project-based investigation conducted entirely in the lab. There are several important differences between our implementation and similar efforts such as Workshop Physics, notably the use of complex, ill-formed problems as a central focus of the pedagogy, the use of distributed expertise to drive collaboration and communication, and the improvement of process skills through iterative refinement. We will describe the foundations of our pedagogical design in cognitive and learning science and previous similar efforts in other learning contexts, contrast it with other inquiry-based designs, and describe some of what we are observing in the test and comparison classes. Data collection and processing is currently ongoing so this presentation will necessarily focus more on the design rationale than on the results. This is a more detailed discussion of a project introduced in the AAPT session FA05.

The goal of professional development (PD) for physics Teaching Assistants (TAs) is frequently about increasing their pedagogical content knowledge. Increased pedagogical content knowledge may better prepare TAs for the next week's instruction, but it is naturally tied to a specific topic, and is therefore limited. We present data from a TA PD seminar that offers pedagogical content knowledge and encourages TAs to reflect on their practice and to view their fellow TAs as resources for improving their instruction. These seminar goals are based on the idea that TAs will be see long-term benefits if they see themselves as part of a community of practice, where the practice is physics instruction. Using video data from weekly PD meetings, we report on elements are part of the establishment of a community of practice.

As students transition to become scientists they must develop the skills necessary to solve ill-structured problems encountered in their professional lives.  We have investigated students' ill-structured problem solving strategies during a capstone project in an upper-division electronics and instrumentation laboratory course. Prior to this project, the students had learned about electronics circuits and devices in this course through mini-lectures and laboratory activities earlier in the semester. Completing the ill-structured capstone project requires students to use their knowledge of electronics to improve the measurements done on a physics experiment they had worked on in a previous semester. As a group, the students proposed ideas to improve the measurement design and then built circuitry to implement this improved design. We describe the activities that students worked on as they completed the capstone project as well as their interactions with each other during this ill-structured task.

In a climate where teachers feel de-professionalized at the hands of regulations, testing, and politics, it is vital that teachers become empowered both in their own teaching and as agents of change. This physics education research study investigates the Streamline to Mastery (S2M) professional development program, in which the teachers engage in action research while designing future professional development opportunities for themselves and for fellow teachers. The research reported here describes the process of empowerment through changes in roles and identities over time. Videotaped data were analyzed to glean insight in language, practice, and participation shifts as secondary physical science teachers participated and formed the S2M community and engaged in their own classroom research. Implications for the role of PER in teacher professional development and teacher preparation will be discussed. This research is partially funded by the NSF DUE grant #934921.

In this poster we present an alternative perspective to physics expertise research. Using Lave and Wengers theoretical perspective of Legitimate Peripheral Participation as a guide to understanding expertise development, we redefine expertise from the perspective of the physicists. We analyze data from an ethnographic, qualitative study of a physics research group and draw data from multiple sources to triangulate a definition of expert. Results show that a very critical part of becoming a physics expert in this physics research group is communicating ones scientific ideas in writing. Evidence suggests that scientific writing is at the heart of this physics research group. It is demonstrated through the students perception of scientific writing as an important aspect in expertise development and it is a significant discussion point in the research meetings. Thus, it appears that learning to write a scientific paper is a process parallel to developing physics expertise.

Beginning fall 2007 successive 48-student cohorts of entering freshmen bio-science majors have been enrolled in reformed course sections of our large introductory physics course at UC Davis to test the proposition that students who were exposed simultaneously to both math and science courses, which explicitly stress sense-making rather than memorization, would more quickly develop habits of mind and approaches to learning that are more productive and useful than the memorization mindset that is so typical of entering freshmen. Students' epistemological gains were measured using MPEX II in the 2009-2010 school year. These gains are significantly more positive than those of sophomores, juniors, or seniors who were in other sections of the same course.   Post test scores are modeled as a function of pre-test scores and student class standing, eg. sophomore, etc., controlling for a variety of incoming student characteristics to discern the effects of when a sense-making physics course is taken.

Research based laboratories were introduced in the 2nd semester algebra and calculus based introductory physics courses at Texas Tech University in the fall of 2010.  Students were given pre and post tests to measure the effectiveness of the labs.  Data from Spring 2011 are presented for the lab dealing with Faraday's Law of Induction, showing gain based on whether the lecture instructor taught in a traditional manner or employed lab-lecture integration coupled with interactive engagement.

This work presents research about the degree of assimilation of the concept of the uncertainty principle by Physics Engineering students at a private Mexican university. They have been previously exposed to this concept in non-active learning traditional courses. Some of them were interviewed to establish a taxonomic table of their conceptual errors about the uncertainty principle. The results presented serve as a base for the design of units of active learning that integrate the use of interactive applets made by the PhET Team of the University of Colorado. The course learning units cover the concepts related to the uncertainty principle and the activities emphasize collaborative work, discussion, prediction, as well as qualitative and quantitative analysis. Achievement for active learning versus traditional education is compared using demonstrative interviews after the new activities were applied in class.

Conventional wisdom is that teachers have a model of teaching that they enact in the classroom. We studied four middle school science teachers and found that the conventional wisdom does not explain large variations in practices for the same teachers in different contexts. During a study of PhET interactive simulations, we observed four teachers in their regular (non-sim) classes and then in after-school classes in which they used PhET sims and activities developed by the PhET group. These activities were designed to be student-centered and inquiry-based. We found that two teachers led student-centered, inquiry-based activities in their regular classes but, in the after-school classes, controlled the classroom so that the sim activities were teacher-centered. The other two teachers led teacher-centered regular classes, while enacting the sim activities in student-centered ways. We observe that teachers practices are highly sensitive to context and we consider two possible explanations for these observations.

In this poster we present an initial analysis connecting key elements of Modeling Instruction (MI) to self-efficacy experience opportunities. Previously, we demonstrated that MI has positive effects on self-efficacy when compared with traditional Lecture instruction. We also found a particularly strong positive effect on the social persuasion source of self-efficacy for women in the MI class. Our current study seeks to understand through what mechanisms MI influences self-efficacy. We demonstrate this connection through an in-depth analysis of video chosen to exemplify MI techniques used in a problem-solving episode by three female participants enrolled in a MI introductory physics class. We provide a rich and descriptive analysis of the self-efficacy experiences opportunities within this context and discuss how these opportunities provide a potential explanation of how MI influences self-efficacy.

Traditional instruction on energy often presents forms of energy as a seemingly arbitrary list to be memorized, with little discussion of the meaning or purpose of these forms. Learners often struggle to make sense of these forms, and neither physicists nor physics educators are explicit about the criteria used to create these lists. This article presents our understanding of the meaning and purpose of forms, based on (1) our understanding of how physicists have used forms and (2) our observations of how elementary teachers create new forms and categorize existing forms in order to understand real-world problems. We propose that explicitly articulating the criteria used to identify forms of energy can empower teachers and students and help them to understand both the concept of energy and the nature of science.

Physics students enter our classroom with significant learning experiences and learning goals that are just as important as their prior knowledge. Consequently, they have expectations about how they should be taught. The instructor enters the same classroom and presents the students with materials and assessments that he/she believes reflect his/her learning goals for the students. When students encounter a reformed physics class, there is often a misalignment between students perceptions, and learning goals the instructor designed for the students. We want to propose that alignment can be achieved in a reformed physics class by taking a holistic view of the classroom. In other words, it is not just about teaching physics, but a problem of social engineering as well. We will discuss how we applied this social engineering idea on multiple scales (individual students, groups, and the whole class) to achieve alignment between students expectations and the instructors learning goals.

Most rubrics are designed to satisfy the following purposes: setting the learning goals, helping the instructor to determine where the students are, providing a scale for assigning grades. In our physics class we would like to achieve one more purpose: to use rubrics to guide students toward self-directed learning. We designed a homework rubric with only three items. This made the rubric easy for students to understand and easy for the instructor to implement. The three-item-rubric focuses on requiring students to reflect on their own thought processes, check consistency between representations, and evaluate the result. In the process, students slowly become accustomed to the complex process of self-directed learning. Through the process of reflection and self-evaluation, students also gain confidence in their own understanding before they receive the instructors feedback. By the end of the semester students were able to demonstrate the ability to learn on their own.

In support of an NSF-CCLI program, we developed a multiple-choice efficacy assessment for the energy concept.  What makes this work novel amongst the sea of energy concept assessments is the intended audience:  elementary and early childhood education majors.  While these are smart and capable college students, their demographics require a different assessment than our engineering students.  We will discuss the development of the assessment and our preliminary results.

Many researchers and textbooks have promoted the use of rigid prescribed strategies for encouraging development of expert-like problem-solving behavior in novice students.  The UBC Physics 100 course has been using Context-Rich problems with a prescribed five-step strategy since 2007.  We have coded audio recordings of students during group problem-solving sessions to analyze students' epistemological framing based on the implicit goal of their discussions.  By treating the goal of understanding the physics situation as sensemaking, we analyze the effectiveness of structured prompts intended to promote a shift to a sensemaking discussion.

The Colorado Learning Assistant (LA) Program serves as a content-specific supplement to standard teacher preparation programs. In addition to transforming undergraduate STEM courses, it recruits and prepares math and science majors for teaching careers by involving university STEM faculty. The research reported here compares the teaching practices of in-service teachers who participated in the LA experience as undergraduates to colleagues who did not participate in the LA program as undergraduates but were certified through the same program. We report on teachers views of assessments, their views of learning, and differences in their teaching practices.  This analysis is based on interviews with approximately 30 teachers and observations of their classrooms throughout their induction years of teaching. This work considers how the LA program may help improve current teacher preparation models.

That students think of wavepulses as if throwing balls down a long taut spring is well established [1,2]. Typical questions involve students imagining the spring already pulled taut; a different scenario would imagine them pulling the spring tight first. This situation creates a different baseline of physical experience from which to reason. For example, it provides an experience in which tension is a relevant measure in the system. We investigated the effects of students pulling the spring (or not) in interviews after instruction. We also wrote two surveys, each giving a different physical description of a typical problem. From interviews, we find evidence that a different embodiment of the problem affects students' responses. In surveys, with students asked to imagine different situations, we found no such evidence.

We previously reported on the success of a psychological intervention implemented to reduce gender differences in achievement in an introductory college physics course. In this prior study, we found that the gender gap on exams and the FMCE among students who completed two 15-minute self-affirmation writing exercises was significantly reduced compared to the gender gap among students who completed neutral writing exercises. In a follow-up study we replicated the self-affirmation intervention in a later semester of the same course, with the same instructor. In this paper, we report the details and results of the replication study, where we find similar trends along some measures (exams) and do not observe these trends along others measures (FMCE).  We begin to investigate the critical features of replicating educational interventions, finding that replicating educational interventions is challenging, complex, and involves potentially subtle factors, some of which we explore and others that require further research.

The Physics Education Group at the University of Washington is examining the extent to which students are able to interpret graphs of potential energy vs. position and use these graphs to infer kinematic and dynamic quantities about a system. The findings reveal difficulties that many students have in relating total energy, potential energy and kinetic energy. Some problems seem to be graphical in nature (e.g., interpreting graphs of potential energy vs. position as if they were of position vs. time). Others arise in specific cases, such as when the potential energy is negative. The results have implications beyond the introductory level since graphs of potential energy are used in advanced courses on classical and quantum mechanics.

This report analyzes the results of the implementation at a large private Mexican university of the Pedagogical Expectancy Violation Assessment (PEVA), developed by Gaffney, Gaffney and Beichner [1]. The PEVA was designed to evaluate shifts of the first students' expectations due to the initial orientation and experiences in the classroom. The data was collected at the Student-Centered Classroom, based on the Student Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs (SCALE-UP) classroom. Three professors participated with their groups during the first semester they implemented their courses in this environment. Participants were enrolled either in a Pre-Calculus, Differential Equations, or Electricity and Magnetism course. The results indicate shifts in students expectations during the semester and reveals differences in shifts among the different courses.

This paper attempts to use Rasch theory to explicate the latent construct of BEMA the Brief Electricity & Magnetism Assessment. BEMA is a 30-item multiple-choice test, designed to measure student understanding of basic electricity and magnetism (E&M) concepts at the introductory physics level. Differing from many concept inventories, such as the FCI, BEMA covers a broad range of topics in the E&M domain. A great deal of prior research has been conducted to evaluate its validity and reliability, and implement it to gauge students performance. However, all these efforts relied on students raw data entry with the Classical Test Theory (CTT) for analysis. In the present study we applied the Rasch model to investigate the extent to which the BEMA items can measure a single underlying construct, students understanding of E&M. In addition, we sought to explore multiple latent constructs for comparison with the single-construct case.

We perform an experiment involving 300 students in an active-learning introductory physics course for biological science undergraduates at the University of California, Davis.  The students are divided into 10 discussion/labs (DLs) that meet for 140 minutes twice a week and are taught by five teaching assistants (TAs).  Five DLs are autonomy-supportive in that during the second half of each class the students choose how to apply or clarify what they have learned.  We compare this experimental group to a control group of five traditional active-engagement DLs.  Each TA teaches one autonomy-supportive and one traditional DL.  We hypothesize that increased autonomy-support will help improve attitudes, increase interest, and enhance performance.  We measure these effects with specially designed surveys and grades.  This study could have important implications for introductory physics class design by testing whether the positive effects of increased student autonomy in class outweigh the benefits of the instructor making most of the choices for the students.

In Physics Education Research (PER) it is often considered important to build course reforms based on input from non-PER faculty on their learning goals for students.  Our upper-division course reform efforts at the University of Colorado start with such input, and these conversations with faculty enrich and guide our course reforms.  We have discovered additional benefits of such conversations, such as that they serve as a forum for discussions of pedagogy and PER.  However, it is not always obvious  to the faculty or to the PER researchers  what approach will lead to successful meetings. During the process of several course transformations we have met with diverse faculty to generate consensus learning goals and course assessments. We describe the general approach used to structure and facilitate these meetings, and include details on what these meetings entailed, how we achieved broad participation and productive conversations, as well as potential pitfalls to avoid.

Faculty and their institutions should have a shared set of metrics by which they measure teaching effectiveness.  Unfortunately, the current situation at most institutions is far from this ideal.  As part of a larger interview study, physics faculty were asked to describe how their institutions evaluate teaching effectiveness. The most common response was that institutions commonly rely on anonymous numerical ratings of courses by students (student evaluations of teaching effectiveness) for most or all of their assessment.  Faculty were often skeptical that the metrics used by their institutions were sufficient to reasonably evaluate teaching effectiveness.  In this poster we present faculty perspectives of institutional evaluation of teaching effectiveness and compare these to the research literature on the evaluation of teaching effectiveness.

The Pathway Active Learning Environment synthetic tutoring system is capable of collecting large numbers of students' short responses to open-ended questions.  The analysis of these responses may provide insight into the utility of the system, as well as information about student understanding of physics.  The free-response nature of our data lends itself to qualitative analysis, however large data sets benefit from automated analysis.  Natural language processing and data mining approaches, such as clustering, have been of interest across a variety of fields for automating the analysis of qualitative data.  However, content-specific vocabulary, an abundance of search features, some of which are irrelevant, and inherent limitations on computers abilities to match meaning are challenges that must be overcome.  In this poster we discuss the extraction of features from human-grouped responses that may be meaningful and also useful for training automated systems for the analysis of future data.

This study investigates the gaze patterns of undergraduate college students attending a lecture-based physical science class to better understand the relationships between gaze and focus patterns and student attention during class. The investigators used a new eye-tracking product; Tobii Glasses.  The glasses eliminate the need for subjects to focus on a computer screen or carry around a backpack-sized recording device, thus enabling the ability to investigate a broader range of research questions.  This investigation includes what students focus on in the classroom (i.e. demonstrations, instructor, notes, board work, and presentations) during a normal lecture, what diverts attention away from being on task as well as what keeps a subject on task. We report on the findings from 8 subjects during lectures designed for future elementary school teachers.

Strategic knowledge is required to appropriately organize procedures and concepts to solve problems.  We are in the process of validating a standardized instrument assessing strategic knowledge in the domain of introductory mechanics.  This instrument is inspired in part by Lawson's Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning and Van Domelen's Problem Decomposition Diagnostic.  The predictive validity of the instrument has been suggested by studies showing significant correlation with performance on final exams administered in introductory mechanics courses at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Georgia Institute of Technology.  In order to study the validity of the content from the students perspective, we have administered the instrument in free-response format to 40 students enrolled in calculus-based introductory mechanics at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville.  This procedure has the additional advantage of improving the construct validity of the inventory, since student responses suggest effective distractors for the multiple-choice form of the inventory.

Magnetic induction has been known to be a particularly difficult concept in introductory physics. In this project, we build upon our previous research on probing the difficulties students have with magnetic flux in regards to Lenz's Law and Faraday's Law. This presentation will explore student responses when the format of the instrument was reversed, so that students had to use a flux vs. time graph to infer details of the physical situation. Although the newer version of the survey identifies other difficulties students have, the student responses suggest the value of this reverse process in both probing student thinking and in instruction on magnetic flux.

Could the well-established fact that males tend to score higher than females on the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) be due to gender bias in the questions? The eventual answer to the question hinges on the definition of bias. We assert that a question is biased only if a factor other than ability (in this case gender) affects the likelihood that a student will answer the question correctly.  The statistical technique of differential item functioning allows us to control for ability in our analysis of student performance on each of the thirty FCI questions. This method uses the total score on the FCI as the measure of ability. We conclude that the evidence for gender bias in the FCI questions is marginal at best.

It has been known that context in homework exercises and exam questions affects student performance and highlights gender differences in the physics classroom.  Writing assignments that ask students to evaluate and create may help overcome some of these issues and improve conceptual gains of female students.  One example of such an assignment is that of problem design.  Problem design assignments were assigned to a subset of students in an undergraduate College Physics course, and assessment was performed to measure and compare conceptual gains for all students.  Two concept surveys (FCI and EMCS) were used to assess the students conceptual gains and whether females or males might benefit more from the assignment, with the awareness that gender biases may exist within the surveys themselves.  The students' attitudes were also probed to investigate if those opinions shaped the outcome of the potential benefits associated with the completion of the problem design assignment.

When grading a large stack of student solutions, there are two things I find most difficult; 1) determining how much each error is worth, and 2) balancing that with how much correct work the student has shown while still applying the rubric fairly. I describe a grading technique in use for a large-enrollment introductory physics course that separates student responses into concept-centered categories and effectively eliminates these two difficulties.  More importantly this technique allows instructors to assign grades based on apparent conceptual understanding rather than procedural ability.  Data from our study comparing traditional and categorical graders will also be discussed.

Research has shown that students' beliefs regarding their own abilities in math and science can influence their performance in these disciplines.  I investigated the relationship between students' estimated performance and actual performance on five exams in a second semester calculus-based physics class.  Students in a second-semester calculus-based physics class were given about 72 hours, after the completion of each of five exams, to estimate their individual and class mean score on each exam.  Students were given extra credit worth 1% of the exam points for each estimating their score correct within 1% of the actual score and another 1% for estimating the class mean score within 1% of the correct value.  I compared students' individual and mean score estimations with the actual scores to investigate the relationship between estimation accuracies and exam performance of the students as well as trends over the semester.

An ongoing partnership was formed between the conceptual physics classes at an urban high school and the second-grade classes at an elementary school in the same district. During the latter half of the course, students in the high school classes learned how to create backward design lesson plans and utilize formative assessments to measure student understanding. The physics students then created lesson plans pertaining to three units of study (Newton's Laws, conservation of energy, and electrostatics), which they implemented in their partner elementary classroom. Participating physics classes were comparatively evaluated for effects on content understanding and retention, engagement, motivation, and perception of learning. Data from four classes will be presented with recommendations for continuing the elementary-secondary physics partnership.

In a large private Mexican University both introductory physics and mathematics courses are taught in a Student-Centered Learning Classroom (ACE classroom in Spanish) which is based on the Student Centered Active Learning Environment for Undergraduate Programs (SCALE-UP) classroom. [1] In both courses, activities to improve students' Problem-Solving skills are implemented. To assess Problem-Solving skills, we use the Physics Problem-Solving Assessment Rubric by Docktor [2] in which students' solution of a problem is assessed. In this contribution we propose an implementation protocol that reduces average raters' disagreement. This protocol enables novice raters to reach an average disagreement as low as 14% in the first implementation.

The ACE classroom (Spanish for Student-Centered Learning), based on SCALE-UP aims to establish a high collaborative participation and interactive learning environment [1]. Previous studies used qualitative video analysis to identify clusters of behavior that reflect verbal reasoning [2]. A multiple-case study was conducted using the heuristic for Taxonomies of Interpersonal Skills [3]. A total of 720 minutes of videorecordings were analyzed including sessions from both introductory physics and mathematics courses offered in ACE classroom during Fall 2010 and Spring 2011. There was a high recurrence for altercentrism ability and a large number of expressions of care and support among members of each team. There was also a considerable change in the communication context from a 10% academic at the beginning to nearly 90% by the end of the semester. These results confirm that design enables a collaborative learning environment and promotes development of students interpersonal skills.

You've seen them in your college physics classes; bright students who seem to know the material, but fail the exams.  Even when you work with them one-on-one to help them master the physics, they still fail the exams.  We posit that knowing the material is not the problem, but rather it is about self-efficacy.  To test this hypothesis, we spent six weeks with two groups of students; one was given a heavy dose of physics instruction and homework; the other group was given a selection of PER-inspired activities designed to improve self-efficacy.  At the end of the semester both groups' self-efficacy improved as did their exam performance, but the difference is impressive.

Most of the students who enter the Physics content course for pre-service elementary and middle school teachers at the University of Kentucky are, at least anecdotally, uncomfortable with their understanding and ability to teach physics. Consequently, one goal for this course is to improve students' self-efficacy for both of those aspects; regardless of one's ability to do physics, how could we expect her to teach it if she feels uncomfortable with the subject? In this project, we investigate students' levels of self-efficacy at the beginning and end of the course, confirming that while students enter with low self-confidence, they leave significantly more confident both in their understanding of physics and their teaching of it. Nonetheless, there is still room for improvement. By comparing two distinct sections of the course, we seek to isolate specific aspects of the course with the greatest opportunity for impact.

Research in several disciplines has shown that using visual cues to focus learners attention on relevant areas in diagrams and animations can increase comprehension and facilitate problem solving. We investigate the effectiveness of visual cues in introductory conceptual physics problems containing a diagram with respect to comprehension and transfer of physics concepts. We also investigate to what extent viewing short duration visual cues influences eye movements. Students in the treatment group saw an initial problem, and if they answered incorrectly, were shown a series of similar problems each overlaid with dynamic visual cues that related to the correct solution. Students in the control group saw the same problems, but without any visual cues.  Students in both groups verbally explained their reasoning after each question and answered transfer problems without cues. We report on students' eye movements while answering the questions, the correctness of answers and verbal reasoning for their answers.

The Florida International University (FIU) Science Collaborative (FSC), a HHMI Science Education Project, seeks to transform instructional practices in biology, chemistry, and physics through supporting faculty as they implement reform. The projects goal is to integrate effective education practices into a model of sustainable, institutional science education reform that expands the talent pool of ethnically and gender diverse future scientists. FSC will: (a) develop a multi-disciplinary faculty cohort to serve as leaders for curriculum innovation; and (b) support their implementation of research-based curricula in introductory science courses. Faculty Scholars will receive significant curricular, assessment, and financial support; thus reducing barriers to reform. Through investing in faculty practices, we hope to develop faculty advocacy for education reform and seed sustained institutional change. These activities, as well as other FSC activities, will be presented.

In this article we report an investigation on the effect of the context and the position of the vectors in the interpretation of dot and cross product. We administered two tests to 380 students completing all introductory physics courses at a large private Mexican university. We studied students' responses in four problems about dot product: 1) no physical context with a tail-to-tail representation, 2) no physical context with a head-to-tail representation, 3) work and 4) electric flux; and in four problems about cross product: 1) no physical context with a tail-to-tail representation, 2) no physical context with a head-to-tail representation, 3) torque and 4) magnetic force. In this article we report the analysis of the responses by comparing the frequencies of the errors in both types of problems to infer students' conceptions in the interpretation of vector products.

On its 30th anniversary, we are re-examining the seminal paper by Chi et al., which firmly established the notion that novices categorize physics problems by surface features (e.g. incline, pendulum, or projectile motion), while experts use deep structure (e.g. energy conservation or Newtons second law). The paper has been cited over 3000 times in scholarly articles over a wide range of disciplines. Yet, this card sorting experiment's research design and analysis methods are not clear. In replicating the study, we set about looking for a way to compare one categorization to another without reference to some standard categorization set, and in doing so have developed a new method for analyzing card sorting experiments.

The nature of energy is not typically an explicit topic of physics instruction.  Nonetheless, participants in physics courses that involve energy are constantly saying what kind of thing they think energy is, both verbally and nonverbally.  The premise of an embodied-cognition theoretical perspective is that we understand the kinds of things that may exist in the world (ontology) in terms of sensorimotor experiences such as object permanence and movement.  We offer examples of intuitive ontologies for energy that we have observed in classroom contexts, including energy as a quasi-material substance; as a means of activation; as a fuel; and as an ineffable quantity which is not subject to further analysis.  In the classroom, multiple and overlapping metaphors for energy complement one another in complex representations of physical phenomena.

This study examined the different modes of group interaction among undergraduate students and their impact on student learning and transfer of learning. A series of group-based, problem- solving activities were designed and implemented throughout a semester in an introductory level physics course. The students were engaged in problem-solving sessions integrated with related laboratory activities using Huddleboards. The sequence of the laboratory activities and problem- solving sessions were altered throughout the semester. Mainly three modes of group interaction were observed: scaffolding mode, converging mode and leading-following mode. This paper describes the strategies used by the students in those modes and also reports the correlation of those modes with the group and individual performances as well as the subsequent transfer of learning. In addition, the impact of sequencing laboratory and problem-solving activities on group performances will be reported.

We discuss an investigation exploring students' difficulties with equations relating to circuit elements.  We find that introductory physics students have great difficulty understanding, e.g., how the resistance of an Ohmic resistor can be written in terms of the potential difference across it and the current through it, but it does not change when the potential difference across the resistor is varied. Many students believed that there should be only one equation for a physical quantity that should provide the one and only "solution" for that physical quantity. They were confused when presented with two separate equations. Similar confusions arose in problems relating to capacitors and inductors.  We discuss these difficulties in the context of introductory physics students' performance on questions about circuit elements both in the free-response and multiple-choice formats and compare their performance to that of the graduate students.This work was supported by NSF.

Advanced undergraduate and graduate students usually have common difficulties in learning the issues about measurement in quantum mechanics. In this paper, we describe some difficulties advanced undergraduate and graduate students have with quantum measurement and analyze the possible origins of these difficulties. Results from this research can be applied to develop the research-based learning tutorials to improve students' understanding of quantum measurement.

The physics department at the University of Colorado, Boulder has recently begun a transformation of its Classical Mechanics/Math Methods course, a middle-division course taken primarily by sophomore physics majors.  We describe the model and process of this transformation, including holding faculty meetings to create consensus learning goals and a conceptual diagnostic, observing students and student work, and adopting, adapting and creating research-based course materials and structures. We report preliminary observations of student learning gains, student attitudes towards the transformation, and some common student difficulties with the course material. Ongoing plans and sustainability issues for the course transformation will also be discussed.

Item Response Theory (IRT) algorithms are being developed to better assess student performance in our Integrated Learning Environment for Mechanics (ILEM; [1]) implemented in LON-CAPA.    A student's skill, as determined by IRT, provides more information than the traditional student score because it takes into account universally calibrated problem difficulties.  Importantly, it allows determination of skill on a universal scale independent of which questions the student answers.  Our approaches seek to dynamically update student and class skill level in ILEM throughout the course based on their performance, rather than relying primarily on the gain from pre/post testing.  We present results comparing IRT and pre/post gain analysis of the Mechanics Baseline Inventory Test, including discussion of item parameters for the 26 questions on the MBT exam.

This paper reports on the effect of students understanding of the basic concepts of nanotechnology tools, through activities set in relevant undergraduate courses. Three hours of hands-on learning took place, which focused on building learners basic understanding of nanotechnology tools such as Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM). This learning activity enhanced high school students understanding in the operation of AFM, in the areas of sensing nanoparticles by measuring van der Waals interactions, understanding AFM resolution and manipulating nanoparticles

Physics teachers expect that students who meet the prerequisite requirement of an introductory physics course will be well-prepared, however, this is not always the case. In reality, every physics teacher faces the challenging question: Can we identify and save the students who meet the required course prerequisite yet who are not really prepared? A recent study at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Eastern Kentucky University suggests that when students take physics, their mathematical skills improve significantly, perhaps even more so than they do in a traditional mathematics course. Encouraged by this fact, PHAS decides to offer students an auxiliary short math course taken concurrently with introductory physics. This work will discuss PHASs practice of diagnosing and assisting math-unprepared students through this course called Success in College Physics.

Operators play a central role in the formalism of quantum mechanics. In particular, operators corresponding to observables encode important information about the results of quantum measurements. We interviewed upper-level undergraduate physics majors and graduate students about their understanding of the role of operators in quantum measurements. Previous studies have shown that many students think of measurements on quantum systems as being deterministic and that measurements mathematically correspond to operators acting on the initial quantum state. This study is consistent with and expands on these results. We report on how students make sense of a quantum measurement problem involving sequential measurements and the role that the eigenvalue equation plays in this sense-making. We find that although these students recognized the importance of the eigenvalue equation, a misuse of superposition leads to unproductive analyses.

As a first step to determine if different curricula or activities such as on-line computer coaching can help improve students' problem solving skills, one needs to establish a baseline. To that end we assessed student problem solutions on in-class tests as they progressed through the first semester of a calculus-based introductory physics course (mechanics). The assessment tool used was the problem-solving rubric developed by the University of Minnesota PER Group (Docktor 2009) designed to measure problem-solving skills along five different dimensions that characterize differences between expert and novice problem solving. Student problem-solving interviews were used as a consistency check of the results.  The results from a representative sample of the students in the class will be presented.

Most definitions of forms of energy, including the national standards, suggest that forms are somehow associated with physical processes and properties of systems, but are silent on exactly how a form of energy relates to the physical state of a system.  Form is a useful shorthand label for describing the state of a system, which can enable efficient communication, but can also obscure meaning.  When a student uses a label for a form of energy, we do not know what meaning is packed inside that label.  We present video analysis of teachers studying energy in a summer professional development program.  By watching them grapple with a novel form of energy that is not included on standard lists of forms, we can better understand how they think about form in general.  Implicit in this process is an understanding of the meaning of form that goes above and beyond the standard.

We have observed first year undergraduate physics students at the University of Edinburgh attempting physics problems using the think-aloud protocol. A Livescribe smart pen was used to capture the students pen strokes and speech in synchronisation.  This approach provides a less intrusive means of measuring students behaviour than methods such as video recording, and more authentically captures how students would normally solve problems: without observers present, and with ordinary paper and pen. Problem solving activities were characterised by coding the think-aloud recordings with respect to identified problem solving behaviours, the recommended problem solving model given in class, and the representations used (diagrams, equations, words etc.).  The observed students were categorised into quartiles depending on previous exam score, allowing comparison between their quartile placing and their problem solving activities. Students in all observed quartiles showed very limited planning and self-assessment, but used multiple representations throughout the solution process.

It is important for a research community, such as Physics Education Research (PER), to understand how much funding it commands and where this funding comes from.

This poster will present the survey results related to the number, size, and source of grants that are being funded in our community.

We summarize results from a valid and reliable instrument we have developed to probe student conceptual understanding of the relationships between the directions of net force, velocity, and acceleration in one dimension. There were three main findings. First, a significant fraction of students chose partially-correct responses, and from pre- to post-test, many students moved from misconception to partially correct responses or from partially-correct to fully correct responses. Second, there were asymmetries in responding to conditional relations. For example, students answered questions of the form "Given the velocity, what can be inferred about the net force?" differently than converse questions "Given the net force, what can be inferred about the velocity?" Third, there were hierarchies in student responses, suggesting for example that understanding the relation between velocity and acceleration is necessary for understanding the relation between velocity and force. Finally, we discuss how these findings might be applied to instruction.

PeerWise is a free, online system that allows student groups to author, share, answer, rate and comment on student-generated multiple choice questions. It incorporates social functionality common to many Web2.0 applications, and features robust peer-assessment of the quality and usefulness of student submissions. We have piloted the use of PeerWise in first year physics courses at the University of Edinburgh in the 2010-11 session as part of the in-course assessment. We have found that the general standard of student submissions has been high, reaching truly outstanding quality in the best cases. Use of the system has produced enhanced student engagement with course material outside class hours and is correlated with enhanced performance on the end of course examination for the majority of students.  PeerWise seems well-suited to providing effective peer feedback and assessment, enhancing the sense of community in the class, and unleashing untapped creative potential in the students.

Through analysis of research papers, class observations, instructor interviews, and questionnaires, we examine student learning uncertainty in lower division physics laboratories. Because uncertainty is a very subtle, and in fact philosophical, topic, its treatment is paramount in students reception of the topic. Through this analysis we hope to enhance the methodology used to present uncertainty to students.

When teaching physics, instructors often use examples to illustrate concepts and to demonstrate the robustness of physical principles. The choice of particular examples is often left to intuition and instructional experience.  In this study, a more theoretical route to example choice is explored using concepts related to projectile motion and the balance-scale.  The contingency model is a computational model that proposes that certain patterns in the co-occurrence of two events can result in the learning of a causal association between the events. Our results demonstrate that different types of examples affect student answers in ways that are mostly consistent with the predictions made by the contingency model. Additionally, when asked to produce a physical "rule" to explain their answers, the students' self-reported rules were consistent with contingency model predictions. These responses, however, did indicate that examples alone were insufficient to teach complex functional relationships between physical dimensions, such as torque.

Calculus-based introductory physics serves as a gatekeeper course for physics and engineering majors. Unfortunately, there are always students who fail or receive poor grades. It would be helpful for advisers to identify predictors for success in the course so they could point at-risk students to supporting resources (e.g. tutoring) and/or preparatory courses. To better understand these predictors, a study was conducted with 273 undergraduate students enrolled in a calculus based physics course at a large Midwestern University. Variables examined were: homework, attendance, lab performance, and score on the first exam. The study further investigated whether a student's major or gender was correlated to his/her academic success. Results show that average exam score (which contributes 59% towards the final grade) is highly correlated with lab score, homework average, and attendance (measured by four random checks). Additionally, the analysis indicates that neither the student's major nor gender influence his/her average exam score.

From the history of the development of Physics one quickly becomes aware that without quantitative reasoning Physics would not have reached the state of development it has today. In addition, the large number of published ``Comments on ...'' and ``Reply to ...'' tells us that the conceptual understanding of physical phenomena is very elusive and hard to grasp even to experts. By the analysis of published research we will be showing evidence that a well structured problem solving strategy taught as a dynamical process offer a feasible way for students to learn physics quantitatively and conceptually, while helping them to reach the state of an Adaptive Expert highly skillful on innovation and efficiency, a desired outcome from the perspective of a Preparation for Future Learning approach of the process of teaching and learning Physics effectively.

One of goals of every class activity is to create a foundation for the future learning.  Previous research confirmed that promoting efficiency of learning by supplying the expert written well-structured lab is not effective for the subsequent learning from a normative resource. We compared written discourse of three groups of students who conducted three types of lab: a design lab in mechanics (control group), a traditional cookbook lab, and an innovation lab in thermal conductivity prior to learning from the normative text on thermal conductivity. We followed with qualitative analysis of students answers to the questions based on the reading. We found that students who conducted the cookbook lab prior to reading the text not only acquired less conceptual understanding, but also used higher level of cognitive activities and pictorial representations less frequently than the other two groups. Our research shows that cookbook labs are harmful for student subsequent learning.

This poster will present an experiment in project/problem-based learning (PBL) in an upper division mathematical physics course.  The group project in the course involved modeling a zombie outbreak of  the type seen in AMCs The Walking Dead.

Students independently learned and utilized numerical methods to solve highly coupled systems of differential equations.  This work will also explore student perceptions and reactions to problem-based learning, and the feasibility of using PBL as the sole pedagogy in upper division physics courses.

We employ four distinct statistical methods to model day-to-day changes in student responses to simple conceptual questions.  These questions were administered several times per week to separate, randomly selected groups of introductory physics students.  The four methods applied to parameter estimation were least-squares estimation, maximum-likelihood estimation, autoregressive integrated moving average series modeling (ARIMA), and Bayesian estimation.  Each method is able to estimate the impacts of specific learning interventions such as lectures, homework assignments, and exams.  We present brief introductions to each of these four methods, as well as a comparison of their results to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages for each.

A common learning goal for modern physics instructors is for students to recognize a difference between the experimental uncertainty of classical physics and the fundamental uncertainty of quantum mechanics.  Our prior work has shown that student perspectives on the physical interpretation of quantum mechanics can be characterized, and are differentially influenced by the myriad ways instructors approach interpretive themes in their introductory courses.  We demonstrate how a transformed modern physics curriculum (recently implemented at the University of Colorado) can positively impact student perspectives on quantum physics, by making questions of classical and quantum reality a central theme of our course, but also by making the beliefs of our students (and not just those of scientists) an explicit topic of discussion.

We report on RAWR, a new web-based system for monitoring student understanding of a wide range of introductory physics concepts throughout the term. RAWR rests upon a novel application of between-student testing to university physics courses during the time of instruction. Data collected during the alpha-testing phase on over 1200 students at Rochester Institute of Technology will be presented, as will examples of a variety of statistical analyses that are available to the  participating instructor.  Because large student numbers improve statistical analysis, it is particularly appropriate for large enrollment classes. RAWR enters the beta-testing stage at a number of external institutions in Fall 2012.

Model-based reasoning in physics requires, among other skills, the use of deductive reasoning.  In two different contexts -- pencil and paper problems requiring qualitative reasoning, and computational activities modeling system dynamics -- we have observed that many science and engineering students in the introductory calculus-based course do not appear to be employing even simple formal deductive logic.   One of our studies focuses on modeling student deductive reasoning as a search through possibility space.  Another study focuses on designing tasks to keep students focused on a model rather than intuitive guessing, by asking them to predict the behavior of an incomplete model.  Understanding how students actually approach model-based deduction can inform the design of instruction in this and future courses (especially relativity and quantum mechanics) that rely heavily on students' ability to reason formally and their confidence in the results of such reasoning.

Research on learning and problem solving in upper-division physics courses reveals a significant gap between the levels of problem solving sophistication and of abstraction developed by students in traditional lower-division courses and those presumed by traditional upper-division instruction. The sophomore modern physics course focused on relativity, quantum mechanics and their applications is an ideal middle-division setting in which to help students bridge this gap. This paper is a preliminary report on a design research project to produce a modern physics curriculum that accomplishes this. Our approach tests and refines instructional design theory along with the new curriculum. The theory is grounded in cognitive science and mathematics education research on transfer and on abstraction that illuminates resource theory. The new modern physics curriculum is inspired by the Matter & Interactions introductory physics curriculum and explicitly exploits cognitive resources developed by students who have studied it.

Differentiation and integration are very powerful mathematical tools widely used in calculus-based introductory physics. Students are expected to have the prerequisite mathematical skills to solve physics problems. However, research shows that students encounter several difficulties when transferring calculus knowledge to physics problem solving. Based on the knowledge of the difficulties students encountered with the use of differentiation and integration in physics from previous studies, we are developing instructional materials aimed at facilitating students to address these difficulties in several topics in introductory physics. We have implemented these materials in group problem solving sessions aimed at enabling students to construct and apply the mathematical concepts of tangent lines, slope, Riemann sum, integration and approximation in physics contexts. We discuss the development of our instructional materials and students ability to transfer the concepts to new types of problems after our group problem solving sessions.

Research has shown that students activate a diverse set of resources to construct a mental model of how pulley systems reduce the force needed to lift a load. We report on a study in which students enrolled in a conceptual physics laboratory spent two weeks investigating pulley systems using either physical or virtual manipulatives. Students were given written materials which guided them through a series of activities which scaffolded their construction of a mental model. They were required to make predictions and then test these predictions by building and comparing different pulley systems. Students were presented with a challenge to design the best pulley system to lift a piano at the end of each week. We compare how the students' models develop between the physical and virtual treatments as well as investigate the ways in which they use the manipulatives while completing the scaffolding activities.

In addition to promotion of inquiry-based classroom practices and increasing the level of content knowledge in the cases of both teachers and students, a major focus of the School Year Based Inquiry Learning (SYBIL) professional development program is that of scientific reasoning. While the learning of content knowledge is an important goal of K-12 science education, concepts such as process skills and reasoning ability are also becoming increasingly more prevalent aims.  Using a measure of scientific reasoning ability at both a teacher and student level, hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis indicates a positive relationship between a teachers reasoning ability and the reasoning ability of his or her students. This analysis provides evidence that a teachers ability to reason scientifically affects his/her students ability to reason, and therefore a vital component of the professional development.

One goal of Florida International Universitys  (FIU) Learning Assistant (LA) seminar is to help our participants develop as reflective practitioners.  We endeavor to reach this goal by means of classroom activities, classroom discussion, and homework assignments.  Weekly written reflections on course readings and teaching experiences are assigned to help our students learn to reflect through writing.  To assess our LAs' development in this regard, we have analyzed reflections from our chemistry, mathematics, and physics undergraduate LAs using Hatton and Smiths (1995) [1] criteria for the recognition of evidence for different types of reflective writing.  Presentation of this poster will include the results of our analysis of the level of reflection evident in our LAs writing and excerpts from a sample of the reflections illustrating their use of reflective teaching practices during their teaching experiences.

Drawing appropriate diagrams is a useful problem solving heuristic that can transform the problem into a representation that is easier to exploit for solving the problem. A major focus while helping introductory physics students learn problem solving is to help them appreciate that drawing diagrams facilitates further problem solution. We conducted an investigation in which approximately 120 students in an algebra-based introductory physics course were subjected to three different interventions during the problem solving in recitation quizzes throughout the semester. They were either asked to solve problems in which the diagrams were drawn for them or they were explicitly told to draw a diagram or they were not given any instruction regarding diagrams. We developed a rubric to score problem solving performance of students in different intervention groups. We will present our findings including some surprising results for problems which involve final/initial situations. This work is supported by NSF.

The general problem of effectively using interactive engagement in non-introductory physics courses remains open. We present a three-year study comparing different approaches to lecturing in an intermediate mechanics course at the Colorado School of Mines. In the first year, the lectures were fairly traditional. In the second year the lectures were modified to include Socratic dialogs between the instructor and students. In the third year, the instructor used a personal response system and Peer Instruction-like pedagogy. All other course materials were nearly identical to an established traditional lecture course. We present results from a new instructor-constructed conceptual survey, exams, and course evaluations. We observe little change in student exam performance as lecture techniques varied, though students consistently stated clickers were the best part of the course from which they learned the most. Indeed, when using clickers in this course, students were considerably more likely to become engaged than students in CSM introductory courses using the same methods.

When energy is added to a liquid to evaporate it, what is the form of energy in the gas?  Is it thermal energy, which is indicated by temperature? Is it chemical energy, which is indicated by chemical composition of a substance? [1] Maybe something else?  In a summer professional development course in the Energy Project [2] at Seattle Pacific University, secondary teachers posed this question while cooperating in Energy Theater [3] in order to figure out the energy transfers and transformations in a real refrigerator. Their negotiation of the name of this form of energy boiled down to a discussion of the difference between kinetic and potential energy.  We show how the speech and gesture that mediated the negotiation display different levels of distinction of energy concepts among the teachers, and we suggest how dynamic refinement, or speciation, of these concepts might be promoted strategically in instruction.

One learning objective of contemporary physics instruction is to introduce students to iterative predictions of motion and to some of the numerical integration techniques used to model problems that lack closed-form solutions. The Matter & Interactions introductory mechanics labs enact this objective by having student groups add the fundamental interactions and relations into a sequence of incomplete, yet functional computational models. We present an initial analysis of student conversations as they work in groups to construct a physically appropriate computational model of Rutherford Scattering. Interestingly, the students are able to invoke appropriate physics knowledge in this novel context, but they can also invoke knowledge of the analytic procedures emphasized in other aspects of the course, leading to confusions over the iterative structure of the computational models.

An upper level E&M course (i.e. based on Griffiths) involves the extensive integration of vector calculus concepts and notation with abstract physics concepts like field and potential.  We hope that students take what they have learned in their math classes and apply it to help represent and make sense of the physics.  To assess how well students are able to do this integration and application I have developed a simple concept test on position and unit vectors in Spherical coordinates. In this poster I describe this concept test and present results that show students at all levels (pre-E&M course, post-E&M course, 1st year graduate students) and in different disciplines (physics, electrical engineering) struggle with using non-Cartesian unit vectors.  A curriculum is being developed to address these difficulties.  Some preliminary results from this curriculum are shown.

Writing assignments can be an effective way of getting students to practice higher-order learning skills in physics.  One example of such an assignment is that of problem design.  One version of the problem design assignment asks the student to evaluate the material from a chapter, after all instruction and other activities are complete.  The student is to decide what concepts and ideas are most central, or critical in the chapter, and construct a problem that he or she feels best encompasses the major themes.  Ideally, the designed problem could be given to another student to see if he or she truly understood the important concepts and problemsolving strategies in the chapter.  Students share these problems via Blackboard or another course web shell.  Here, we introduce the assignment and use two concept surveys (FCI and EMCS) to attempt to measure conceptual gains for students completing the problem design assignment.

One goal of physics instruction is to have students learn to make physical meaning of specific mathematical ideas, concepts, and procedures in different physical settings. As part of research investigating student learning in statistical physics, we are developing curriculum materials that guide students through a derivation of the Boltzmann factor, using a Taylor series expansion of entropy. Using results from written surveys, classroom observations, and both individual think-aloud and teaching interviews, we present evidence that, while many students can recognize and interpret series expansions, they often lack fluency with the Taylor series, despite previous exposures in both calculus and physics courses. We present students' successes and failures both using and interpreting Taylor series expansions in a variety of physical contexts.

It is commonly known that students have difficulty connecting the techniques they learn in math classes with necessary steps for solving physics problems.  In this study, introductory-level physics students were given a set of pure math problems and a set of physics problems that required them to use the exact same mathematical processes.  The students were then asked to pair the analogous problems and explain the pairings.  Presented here are the results of that study, which support previous findings that students have difficulty determining how the two are connected and give some insight into what can be done to help scaffold that connection in the future.

Physics students are expected to apply the mathematics learned in their mathematics courses to physics concepts and problems. Few PER studies have distinguished between difficulties students have with physics concepts and those with either mathematics concepts, application of those concepts, or the representations used to connect the math and the physics. We are conducting empirical studies of student responses to mathematics questions dealing with graphical representations of  (single-variable) integration. Reasoning in written responses could roughly be put into three major categories related to particular features of the graphs: area under the curve, position of the function, and shape of the curve. In subsequent individual interviews, we varied representational features to explore the depth and breadth of the contextual nature of student reasoning, with an emphasis on negative integrals. Results suggest an incomplete understanding of the criteria that determine the sign of a definite integral.

In intermediate and advanced physics courses, students are expected to use mathematical, graphical, and physical reasoning, as well as their intuitions. These intuitions may contradict each other and can be inconsistent with ideas developed during small group learning activities. On the topic of damped harmonic motion, students have intuitions about the mathematics, the physics, and the way the graph of the motion should look. Students remain committed to some of these intuitions to the point of not using provided instructional resources. They also deal with contradictions when their commitments to one kind of reasoning conflict with their commitments to another (e.g., the analysis of a mathematical derivation conflicts with that of a free-body diagram summarizing physical reasoning). These multiple commitments have an effect on students' classroom discussion and the way that students reconcile contradictory commitments and conclusions.

Energy concepts are fundamental across the sciences, yet these concepts can be fragmented along disciplinary boundaries, rather than integrated into a coherent whole.   To teach physics effectively to biology students, we need to understand students' disciplinary perspectives.  We present interview data from an undergraduate student who displays multiple stances towards the concept of energy.  At times he views energy in macroscopic contexts as a separate entity from energy in microscopic (particularly biological) contexts, while at other times he uses macroscopic physics phenomena as productive analogies for understanding energy in the microscopic biological context, and he reasons about energy transformations between the microscopic and macroscopic scales.  This case study displays preliminary evidence for the context dependence of students' ability to translate energy concepts across scientific disciplines.  This points to challenges that must be taken into account in developing curricula for biology students that integrate physics and biology concepts.

In this article we report an investigation on students understanding of: 1) unit vectors and, 2) scalar multiplication of a vector. We administered two different tests to a total of 850 students after taking their first introductory physics course on mechanics in a large private Mexican university. The first test about unit vectors was taken by 270 students and the second test about scalar multiplication of a vector by 580 students. In the first part of this article, we analyze students' difficulties sketching the unit vector in the direction of a vector in the Cartesian coordinate plane. In the second part, we analyze students' responses in two types of problems: positive and negative scalar multiplication of a vector. In both parts of this article we describe frequent errors that have not been reported in the literature.

Despite research documenting the potentially positive impacts of research-based physics reforms, few high school physics teachers in the US enact them in their classrooms.  One of the more successfully disseminated reforms is Modeling Instruction.  Our primary research goal was to discern aspects of this reform that contributed to its widespread dissemination and organizational sustainability.  We interviewed five people who played important roles in the development of Modeling Instruction.  Drawing from the literature in communities of practice, innovation, and leadership, we analyzed the interviews to discern aspects of the reform that the interviewees felt led to some of the successes and constraints in its dissemination and sustainability.

In June 2010, the first of two biennial conferences on Transforming Research in Undergraduate STEM Education (TRUSE) brought together researchers in undergraduate physics, mathematics, and chemistry education to transform and integrate research across disciplines. The format included plenary talks, working groups, poster sessions and substantial unstructured time to network with colleagues and build capacity for future investigations.  Research described included projects that exemplify particular disciplinary approaches; work on trans-disciplinary topics such as transfer, representations, and reasoning strategies; and investigations on content topics that cross one or more disciplinary boundaries. After the conference, mini-grants were solicited for seed projects that could lead to longer-term interdisciplinary collaborations. A summary of the conference will be given with descriptions of sample presentations and implications for PER. The organizers will be running the conference again in 2012 with at least one more discipline being included.

The need for highly qualified physics teachers in the U.S. is well established, and reform efforts are underway to develop novel and innovative teacher professional development experiences to improve the quality of K-12 physics education. Streamline to Mastery is an NSF funded learner-centered professional development program that seeks to capitalize on teachers knowledge and experience to move newer physics teachers toward mastery in their fields. Teacher participants in this teacher-driven program choose their own goals and areas of growth. One of these areas has been the development and implementation of inquiry-oriented curriculum, as well as the adaptation of traditional lessons to a greater inquiry orientation. Preliminary findings indicate that teachers' conceptions of inquiry and the relationship of physics classroom inquiry to scientific inquiry have changed significantly as they have engaged in a variety of experiences around the topic.

In the spring term of 2010, Oregon State University began using a SCALE-UP style classroom in the instruction of the introductory calculus-based physics series.  Instruction in this classroom was conducted in three two-hour sessions facilitated by the primary professor and either two graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) or a graduate teaching assistant and an undergraduate learning assistant (LA).  During the course of instruction, two of the eight tables in the room were audio and video recorded.  We examine the practices of the GTAs and LAs in interacting with the students through both qualitative and quantitative analyses of these recordings.  In particular, we examine changes in the practices of the GTAs and LAs as they gain experience in the SCALE-UP environment, as well as differences between the practices of the individual GTAs and LAs of differing experience and background.

As part of a larger study to understand how instructors make teaching decisions, we investigated how graduate teaching assistants (TAs) perceive features of written problem solutions. TAs are an important population to understand; they often provide significant instruction and they also represent the pool of future physics faculty. Twenty-four first-year graduate TAs enrolled in a training course were provided with different instructor solutions for the same physics problem and asked to discuss their preferences for prominent solution features. Preliminary findings reveal that providing a schematic visualization of the problem, listing knowns/unknowns and explaining reasoning in explicit words were the most valued features. Preferences for different features were sometimes in conflict with each other. For example, while the TAs valued solutions where reasoning was explicitly explained, they also valued concise solution. We'll present the reasons behind these preferences and discuss the implications for the professional developments of physics TAs.

This talk will focus on the methodology used to study TAs enrolled in a training course. Data were collected via a series of tasks related to concrete instructional artifacts (solutions to the same physics problem that vary in their representation of expert problem solving as well as in their instructional approach). Important aspects of the design were a) using artifacts from a previous study of faculty to allow for comparison of results, b) developing a written questionnaire that requires respondents to explicitly connect problem features with preferences and reasons, and c) documenting respondent ideas both pre- and post-discussion within their training course.

In the cognitive apprenticeship model, learning occurs most effectively in an environment of expert practice, in which students can articulate why what they are learning matters to them. Studies of transfer suggest that for students to successfully apply physics to another scientific field, it is important to study applications to that field.  Guided by this theoretical framework, we restructured our introductory physics courses for life science and premedical students around biologically rich contexts  examples in which physics plays a significant role in understanding a biological system  to make explicit the value of physics to the life sciences, and modified the syllabus to reflect the topics most relevant to these students. In this paper we describe our approaches to this course, summarize preliminary results, and identify future research directions addressing (1) the role of biological context in learning for these students and (2) issues in implementing such a course for physics faculty.

Teaching assistants (TAs) use multiple conversational methods when interacting with their students, yet they often do not choose the most appropriate methods to help students construct their knowledge of physics. TAs can affect learning in ways that professors cannot, as they typically get more one-on-one time in multiple settings, but they are not making the best use of their opportunities to help students. The goal of this study is to analyze emergent patterns in the interactions when conversation between TA and students shifts from more constructive methods to less constructive methods, and vice versa. �We explore the circumstances that trigger these shifts in the conversation and how TAs conversational methods change with these shifts. We will present preliminary data from the studio laboratory sections of the Matter and Interactions introductory mechanics course showing the patterns that emerge for different TAs.

As the rest of the world catches up to the US in industrial output and technological sophistication, our continued economic prosperity will depend on strengthening our historical success in generating new ideas. While there are limited efforts to foster creativity and innovation through formal and informal instruction in the business world, few efforts exist in science or engineering education. To address this, the Colorado School of Mines has recently created a dedicated Tablet PC classroom where we hold an elective physics course for the purpose of improving creativity in our students. In this talk, we report on the structure of the course and the technologies used. The latter include pedagogical implementations of InkSurvey, a free web-based software package that enables detailed, real-time interactions with the instructor. We assess student progress via the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking, and discuss early work towards developing a physics-specific instrument for measuring creativity.

We transformed an upper-division physics course using a variety of elements, including homework help sessions, tutorials, clicker questions with peer instruction, and explicit learning goals.   Overall, the course transformations improved student learning, as measured by our conceptual assessment.  Since these transformations were multi-faceted, we would like to understand the impact of individual course elements. Attendance at tutorials and homework help sessions was optional, and occurred outside the class environment.  In order to identify the impact of these optional out-of-class sessions, given self-selection effects in student attendance, we performed a multiple regression analysis.  Even when background variables are taken into account, tutorial attendance is positively correlated with student conceptual understanding of the material  though not with performance on course exams.  Other elements that increase student time-on-task, such as homework help sessions and lectures, do not achieve the same impacts.

Turkish high school physics students applying to college must take a university entrance exam. This study investigated the effects of this test on students' approaches to learning physics.  On a survey, tenth grade students first indicated how they study, then discussed how they would advise a hypothetical student, Arzu, to study, where Arzu plans to attend college in another country where no high-stakes entrance exam is used. As Elby (1999) found in a similar study, the students reported very different study approaches for themselves vs. for Arzu. Their learning approaches included mostly surface level learning strategies, such as studying formulas and rote practice problems, while their advice for Arzu contained mostly deeper-level learning strategies, such as studying concepts and relating what is learned in the class to everyday life. The students were explicit in attributing this difference to the university entrance examination.

We have been implementing a web-based system in which students use personal digital assistants (PDAs) to interact with their instructor during lecture. In this presentation, we discuss instructors' implementation strategies, pedagogical approaches and perceived effectiveness of the interactive teaching approach on students' progress, engagement, and achievement. In addition, we will document the impact of the interactive teaching approach on instructors' pedagogical orientation.

Using data collected from a nationally-representative sample of first-year college students, we examine how students' identity development as physics persons and their likelihood to pursue a career in physical science is predicted by differing immigrant experiences. We consider broad factors having a social, economic, or cultural nature as covariates in a propensity score model that assesses differences due to immigrant generation. Our results show that, when controlling for such factors as race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, and gender, students' physics identities and the likelihood of choosing a career in physical science are significantly higher amongst first generation students than second generation (or later) students. We conclude that physical science as a career option can be influenced by the experiences of being an immigrant and through the relationship between origin and host culture.

Demonstrations (demos) are a vital component of most introductory physics courses. Despite the presence of demonstrations in undergraduate physics, research has shown that students learn little, if anything from lecture demos. In addition, some research suggests that demos may even contribute to students misconceptions, depending on how they are delivered. We analyze one delivery method that requires students predictions of lecture demonstration outcomes in introductory mechanics and electricity and magnetism at two large research universities. We compare students predictions before having seen the demonstration to what they report as having observed both right after the demonstration and several weeks later. Students' post-demonstration explanations of the physics behind each demonstration are also analyzed. Triangulation of these data points lead us to better understand how pre-instructional beliefs influence student interpretation and persistent understanding of physics lecture demonstrations. This can mitigate the disconnect that has been shown to exist between what instructors think they are demonstrating and what students actually observe/remember.

As research-based instructional strategies become more widespread, increasing attention is being paid to the instructional role of Teaching Assistants (TAs), as well as the impact of the teaching experience on the TAs own pedagogical development. In previous work [1], we began documenting TA beliefs and presented two contrasting case studies of TA beliefs about teaching physics. In this paper, we begin to build a framework that extends the work on beliefs to identify categories of epistemological and pedagogical resources that TAs draw upon when talking about and when engaging in teaching practices. By applying this framework to observations and interviews of TAs from an introductory physics course, we demonstrate emergent differences in how these instructors talk about their own teaching, as well as examples of how these differences appear to be reflected in their framing of the instructional activity. We conclude with implications for teacher preparation and professional development at the graduate level.

Physics instructors typically try to avoid confusing their students. However, the truism underlying this approach, "confusion is bad," has been challenged by educators dating as far back as Socrates, who asked students to question assumptions and wrestle with ideas. This begs the question: Are confused students lost, or does their confusion indicate more critical thinking than less-confused learners? In previous work, we focused on a single reading assignment, a snapshot. Insights from this work allowed us to refine and expand our study to over 40 snapshots that span two semesters of introductory physics, which involved Just-in-Time Teaching and research-based reading materials.  We evaluated performance on assignments while simultaneously asking students to self-assess their confusion over the material, and then probed whether confused students were correct more or less frequently than not-confused students. We highlight our results and draw some conclusions about confusion. Is it really as bad as it seems?

The PhET Interactive Simulations Project at the University of Colorado Boulder has a new effort to develop and research simulations for middle school physical science. PhET sims have typically been aimed at the college level, but many sims are used in middle school classrooms. Thus, we aim to study the use of PhET sims at this level more systematically, particularly investigating elements of effective sim design and classroom implementation. Over the past year, we have collected observations of middle school students and teachers using PhET simulations. These observations include more than 80 student interviews as well as classroom implementations from 5th-8th grade by 4 different teachers. In this paper, we present general findings from these observations that provide insight for effective use of simulations in middle school classrooms, propose several strategies for designing and implementing simulation activities, and give concrete examples of activities where these strategies have been used effectively.

Within PER relatively little attention has been given to laboratory courses, especially at the upper-division undergraduate level. As part of transforming our senior-level Optics and Modern Physics Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder we are developing learning goals, revising curricula, and creating assessments.  In this paper we report on the establishment of our learning goals and a surrounding framework that have emerged from discussions with a wide variety of faculty, from a review of the literature on labs, and from identifying the goals of existing lab courses.  Our goals go beyond those of specific physics content and apparatus, allowing instructors personalize them to their contexts. We report on five broad themes and associated learning goals: Design (of experiments, apparatus, programs, debugging), Modeling (of natural phenomena, engineered "black boxes", algorithms, systematic error), Math-physics-data connection, Communication and record keeping, and Lab skills (data analysis in Mathematica, LabVIEW, test and measurement equipment).

Over the last several decades, research has challenged the efficacy of the traditional lecture-based instructional model of undergraduate physics education. As a result, a large number of reform-oriented instructional innovations have been developed, enacted, and studied in undergraduate physics courses. While previous work has shown that the impact of course innovations on student learning has been overwhelmingly positive, it has also been highly variable. The purpose of this analysis is to investigate this variability. For this analysis 170 published studies on undergraduate physics course innovations were coded with respect to the characteristics of the innovations as well as the methodological characteristics of the study designs. The findings of this analysis have indicated that nearly half of the variability can be accounted for by study design characteristics rather than by characteristics of the innovations used. However, a subsequent analysis has highlighted some of the critical characteristics of more effective innovations.

We discuss the effect of problem format on students responses. We focus on the information gained about the students thinking processes and knowledge structures as related to the content being assessed. We present data indicating that when students are required to show their calculations and/or explain their reasoning, the instructor has evidence of the level of scientific thinking, or the use of elements of cognitive structure, such as phenomenological primitives (p-prims). We also show data indicating that when the format of multiple choice is compared to other formats (for the same problem), such as explain your reasoning, ranking or  multiple choice with explain your reasoning that the number of students answering completely correctly drops dramatically. Our data indicates that the use of multiple choice as the form of assessment 1) does not give instructors information on the thinking processes of the students and 2) masks the fact that a significant number of students do not get to the correct answer by a consistent and coherent reasoning process.

Research suggests many students have the notion that the magnitude of the static frictional force is always equal to its maximum value. In this study, we examine introductory students ability to learn from analogical problem solving between two problems that are similar in the application of physics principle (Newtons 2nd Law) but one problem involves friction which often triggers the misleading notion. Students from algebra- and calculus- based introductory physics courses were asked in a quiz to take advantage of what they learned from a solved problem provided, which was about tension in a rope, to solve another problem involving friction. To help students process through the analogy deeply and contemplate the applicability of associating the frictional force with its maximum value, students in different recitation classrooms received different scaffolding. We will discuss the types of scaffolding support that were effective in helping students learn these concepts . Supported by NSF.

The University of Colorado's LA-Test research group investigates former learning assistants' classroom practices once they enter the K-12 classroom, using the Scoop notebook, [1] an instructional artifact package developed to assess use of reform practices, as a tool. The authors characterize differences in classroom practices between former Learning Assistants (LAs) teaching at the secondary level, and their colleagues as revealed by the notebook. Analyses of these artifacts indicate significant differences between LA and non-LA groups.  A description of the methodology and implications of using artifact packages to study classroom practice will be presented, detailing the role of the LA experience in teacher preparation.

We present results of an action research project showing a class of pre-service elementary teachers (and their instructors) valuing different learning preferences at two different times during one semester of a Physics and Everyday Thinking course. This was observed using a cogenerative mediation process in which participants discussed individual preferences in order to collectively develop classroom goals near the beginning and again near the end of the course. Throughout the semester, instructors made conscious efforts to raise awareness of this aspect of classroom culture.  The data show a shift from passive (lecturing, giving a study guide, offering incentives), to more active preferences (note-taking, organization, opportunistic learning). As a result of the cogenerative process, changes were made to the course in order to facilitate teaching and learning the nature of science, in ways sensitive to everyones preferences. That sensitivity was informed by both academic literature and the specific classroom culture.

The study investigates the kinds of mental representations constructed by engineering students at Kansas State University when solving problems in the context of kinematics. A cohort of 19 students completed six non-directed tasks posed in different representational forms (mathematical, linguistic and graphical) requiring the generation of linguistic or mathematical models. Individual interviews were conducted immediately after completing the tasks. Based on the students' actions when solving the problems together with their interview responses, two main profiles emerged from the data. Johnson-Laird (1983) cognitive framework was then related to the profiles for inferring about the categories of cognitive structures. The framework proposes three types of internal constructs: propositional representations, mental models and mental images. It is argued that comprehension occurs upon the construction of mental models. However, this study revealed that 11 in 19 participants are classified as using propositional representation while the remaining students construct a mental image.

Students in introductory physics have difficulties when applying calculus to physics problems.  The application of integration to physical situations is especially challenging yet it is crucial to several of the electromagnetism concepts taught in a typical second semester introductory course.  Understanding how students make sense of and apply integration to different physical situations could help guide future instructional development.  Individual interviews were conducted where students talked about their solution approaches for different electric field and electric potential difference problems involving the use of integrals.  A classification scheme developed to understand how students are talking about these problems will be presented.  Evidence from these interviews suggests that students approach integration in these two contexts differently.  The implications that this observation might have on instructional design will be discussed.

Effective problem solvers are often capable of distinguishing deep-structure similarities and differences between problems (Chi et. al., 1981; Jonassen, 2000).  A pilot study conducted in the spring of 2010 provided further evidence that compare and contrast activities implemented in weekly homework assignments over a semester-long, introductory algebra-based physics course facilitated students emphasis on deep-structure details between problems.  This study also revealed a direct correlation between deep-structure emphasis and physical content (e.g., simple harmonic motion, DC circuits). To evaluate the emphasis students placed in deep-structure features, students completed pre- and post- similarity ratings surveys.  A continuation study was completed in the spring of 2011 using a similar in-class treatment, but with different content coverage in the post-treatment surveys.  We will report on the pre- and post-treatment similarity ratings for both studies, and the resultant implications.

Student evaluations can be a useful tool in judging the effectiveness of a course.  Instead of relying solely upon traditional survey-type evaluations,  We have conducted focus group interviews of students at the conclusion of various introductory physics courses (talk about which courses, i.e. experimental sections of the 2-semester University Physics sequence and from an experimental section of physical science).  These mini-focus groups of 1-4 students are conducted by an interviewer who has nothing to do with the teaching and/or grading of the class taken by the student participants.  Such interviews, although semi-structured using a protocol, provide a dynamic forum for student feedback where more in-depth probing of comments may occur.  The insights gained from these interviews with both individual and small groups of students will be discussed and the incorporation of those insights into course design will be discussed.

In previous studies, we have reported a difference in how students' understanding of the physics definition of work in the context of simple machines is supported by performing experiments with physical and virtual manipulatives. We have shown that students who used the virtual manipulative (a computer simulation) before performing a physical experiment more frequently provided the correct response to multiple-choice questions about work.  In this paper, we further analyze students responses to a series of questions about work in the context of inclined planes to explore the models students used to answer the questions.  While it is possible that students who performed the physical experiment were getting penalized on the multiple-choice questions for answering in accordance with their observations (i.e. a longer ramp requires more work due to frictional effects), we actually observe students more frequently using an alternate model that a longer ramp requires less work.

This research was conducted by an urban middle school science teacher who sought to investigate the effects of self-assessment on student performance.  A group of students were asked to give themselves a score on each learning target assessed in class and to provide evidence for their decision.  Student self-assessment scores were compared to scores given by the teacher to see if students who accurately assessed their own learning scored higher on final assessments than students who did not.  Assessment scores between groups of students who completed the self-assessment preparation and students who did not were also analyzed.  Preliminary findings will be discussed in this presentation as well as further implications for this teachers classroom.

"Pyramid exams" (a.k.a. "two-phase exams") are tests in which students first take the test once on their own, turn that copy in, and then take the test again in randomly-assigned small groups. Those of us who use pyramid exams are convinced that students learn more from the test-taking experience than they would with a traditional, individual-only exam. But what do students actually DO in these situations? To address this question, we did some data-mining. Using data on students' answers and scores on each question of the exam and comparing their individual responses to the responses they chose while in the group (where group members were not required to agree), we examined the ways that students change their responses (or don't) from the individual to the group phase, and identified patterns of individual and group behavior.

Clinical interviews provide a laboratory for practicing components of proximal formative assessment in a one-on-one context.  As part of the Energy Project at Seattle Pacific University, learning assistants (LAs) are required to conduct, video-record, share, and reflect on individual physics interviews with a peer.  The goal of the project is to develop the LAs' real-time attention to others' thinking (proximal assessment).  In this context, LAs are asked to be guests at their interviewee's thinking and to refrain from using the interview as a teaching opportunity.  We contrast two LAs' interview experiences in terms of the ontological commitments, (in)formal use of language, and expectations about interviewing and listening that are evident in their interviewing behavior.

We analyze the results of a large-scale assessment project which used available conceptual inventories and locally written pre- and post-tests in the laboratories in order to assess the effectiveness of our laboratory implementation. We found that the instruments were limited in scope and not sufficient to generate an accurate assessment of all aspects of the laboratory implementation. The conceptual inventories assessed both lecture and lab and did not assess problem solving, modeling, aspects of critical thinking or laboratory skills. The locally written pre- and post-tests were limited in coverage. However, they did give information on students' thinking processes, laboratory and problem solving skills. We discuss the need for a more comprehensive assessment instrument that addresses, not just conceptual understanding, but modeling, problem solving, aspects of critical thinking, laboratory and other skills that can be used across courses and universities to evaluate the effectiveness of our instruction.

Creative thought and the ability to innovate are critical skills in industrial and academic careers alike.  There exist attempts to foster creative skills in the business world, but little such work has been documented in a physics context.  In particular, there are few tools available for those that want to assess the creativity of their physics students, making it difficult to tell whether instruction is having any effect.  In this poster we outline a new course in the Colorado School of Mines physics department designed to develop creativity and innovation in physics majors.  We present our efforts to assess this course formatively using tablet PCs and InkSurvey software, and summatively using the discipline-independent Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking.  We also describe early work towards developing a physics-specific instrument.

We investigate gender differences in students' difficulties with concepts related to magnetism.  Our research uses a multiple-choice test whose reliability and validity have been substantiated earlier.  We also conduct individual interviews with a subset of students to get a better understanding of the rationale behind their responses.  We find that females performed significantly worse than males when the test was given both as a pre-test and post-test in traditionally taught calculus-based introductory physics courses. In the algebra-based courses, the performance of females was significantly worse in the pre-test but there was no statistical difference in the post-test performance of males and females. We discuss possible reasons for these differences. Supported by NSF.

In addition to many content goals in specific physics subdisciplines, we all have many other goals for upper-division students, including robust mathematical, experimental, and computational skills.  Our majors should be able to bring a variety of sensemaking tools to their problem-solving: spatial and geometric reasoning, physical intuition, knowledge of the dimensions and sizes of physical quantities, and the ability to compare their answers to known special examples and limiting cases.  They should have a strong sense of how theory and experiment relate and how applications play out in the real world.  Above all, we want our majors to be self-confident problem-solvers who identify themselves as professionals, capable of learning new content and skills as necessary, and of working effectively in both independent and team environments.  In the Paradigms in Physics program at Oregon State University, we have developed a number of curricular strategies intended to foster these skills and attitudes.  During this poster session, we will attempt to facilitate discussion about research strategies that might allow us to begin assessing these non-curriculum goals.

The poster will present several examples of PER-tested assessment techniques incorporated into Intermediate Mechanics Tutorials (IMT), a suite of instructional materials that itself has been modeled after published materials such as Tutorials in Introductory Physics by McDermott, Shaffer, et al., (Prentice-Hall, 2002) and Activity-Based Tutorials by Wittmann, Steinberg, and Redish (Wiley, 2004).  Much like their introductory-level counterparts, the IMT pre- and post-tutorial assessments consist of written "explain your reasoning" tasks designed to probe for persistent conceptual and reasoning difficulties.  In addition, the in-class IMT worksheets include instructor checkpoints for formative student feedback.  This poster will provide evidence supporting the appropriateness and effectiveness of such assessment techniques in intermediate mechanics.  Also to be discussed are selected adaptations of these methods that have been developed by pilot-testers of IMT materials as well as the author of this poster.

Traditional upper-division physics courses tend to focus on summative assessment through quantitative and symbolic problem-solving examination questions.  Reforming instruction suggests the need for  assessment that matches the instructional strategies.  In this poster, we describe assessment strategies implemented in two physics core courses, primarily in a thermal physics course but also in a course in mathematical methods.  Strategies include frequent formative assessment in the form of written ungraded quizzes as well as the inclusion of qualitative written problems on graded quizzes and exams.  Examples of assessment items and student responses will be shown.  In particular, we will show evidence that students at this level respond more positively to 'pretests' than one might expect, suggesting more expert-like epistemological expectations than is often the case in the introductory course.

As part of a study on the science preparation of elementary school teachers, we investigated students' reasoning skills in courses with inquiry-oriented teaching strategies and their counterparts in traditional courses. Inspired by a revision of Bloom's taxonomy [1] and Neiswandt and Bellomo's [2] conceptual structure classification method, we developed assessments that would classify different levels and qualities of indications of students' reasoning ability. The assessment tools are methods of analyzing extended written questions which based on a protocol that can define the question's level of abstraction, knowledge types and cognitive processes. Along with the protocol, we developed a rubric that allowed us analytically examine students' responses through several different lenses. This approach is being test with a large amount of data that were collected nationwide from 20 different universities.  Our initial findings indicate varying results about students' reasoning abilities.

The use of concept inventories to investigate students' learning gains is common in physics education research.  However, comparatively little research has compared students' learning gains on concept inventories with other more traditional assessments in the classroom.  We present a study comparing second semester calculus-based physics students' performance on traditional classroom assessments including exams and homework with learning gains on SEMCO (Survey of Electricity, Magnetism, Circuits and Optics), which was previously created by combining questions on other conceptual surveys such as CSEM and DIRECT.  We report on students' performance on specific items on SEMCO and corresponding traditional classroom assessments that are based on the same topic.  Our results can raise some potentially interesting questions on the validity and usefulness of traditional classroom assessments and conceptual assessments that are often used to measure student learning in introductory physics.

While a multiple-choice test provides an efficient tool for assessment, instructors are often concerned that a free-response format facilitates a more accurate understanding of students' thought processes.  Moreover, free-response questions allow students to get partial credit for displaying different extent of understanding of the subject tested.  Here, we discuss a study in which two carefully designed research-based multiple-choice questions were transformed into free-response format and implemented on an exam in a calculus-based introductory physics course. Students' performance on the free-response questions was graded twice, first by using a rubric, and secondly by converting the answers back to one of the choices in the original multiple-choice format. There was an excellent match between the different free-response answers and the original choices in the multiple-choice questions. The strong correlation between the two scores graded using different methods suggests that carefully designed multiple-choice assessments can mirror the relative performance on the free-response questions.

Quantum mechanics is challenging even for advanced undergraduate and graduate students. In this poster, we discuss the development and evaluation of formative and summative assessment tools for quantum mechanics. The formative assessment tools discussed include research-based concept tests as peer instruction tools, reflective homework problems and pre-tests and post-tests for various Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorials (QuILTs).  The principal summative assessment tool is the Quantum Mechanics Survey (QMS), which covers concepts in quantum mechanics in one spatial dimension in the undergraduate courses. QMS can be useful for measuring the effectiveness of various curricula and pedagogies.

Proximal formative assessment skill development is a primary goal of the academic-year professional development course offered by the Energy Project at SPU. We have adapted a video club model (Sherin & Han, 2004) in which groups of teachers watch and discuss video of classroom interactions. Video from the professional development course shows differences in the qualities of discourse between participants as they discuss episodes of video from their own classrooms. Two dominant orientations of groups of teacher-participants emerge during discussion of classroom video: orientation to details of the video data and interpretation of student discourse and actions; and orientation to the broader instructional context, including comparison to their own classroom experience and considerations of how to improve the instruction. The student-focused orientation appears to be more productive than the instruction-focused orientation for growth in proximal formative assessment skills.

Proximal formative assessment, the just-in-time elicitation of students' ideas that informs ongoing instruction, is usually associated with the instructor in a formal classroom setting. However, the elicitation, assessment, and subsequent instruction that characterize proximal formative assessment are also seen in discourse among peers. We present a case in which secondary teachers in a professional development course at SPU are discussing energy flow in refrigerators.  In this episode, a peer is invited to share her thinking (elicitation). Her idea that refrigerators move heat from a relatively cold compartment to a hotter environment is inappropriately judged as incorrect (assessment). The "instruction" (peer explanation) that follows is based on the second law of thermodynamics, and acts as corrective rather than collaborative. The episode highlights the importance for proximal formative assessment of reserving judgment on learners' ideas until their strengths and weaknesses are well understood.

In a course organized around the development of diverse representations, no single mode of expression offers a complete picture of participants' understanding of the nature of energy.  Instead, we argue, their understanding is actively constructed through the simultaneous use of a range of quite different kinds of representational resources (Goodwin, 2000), including not only words but also gestures, symbolic objects, participants moving their bodies in concert, and whatever other communicative modes the course invites them to use.  Effective proximal formative assessment involves attention to all of these representational resources.  Examples are provided from a teacher professional development course on energy.

We observe no significant effect of gender on grades in our IE introductory mechanics courses at Loyola Marymount University, but we do observe a significant gender gap on FCI normalized gains, with males achieving higher gains than females.  Over the past three years FCI gains have improved for both male and female students in IE classes taught with the Thinking in Physics (TIP) pedagogy.  However, a gender gap on FCI gains remains, even when scientific reasoning abilities are taken into account.  Indeed, the gap appears much greater for students with the strongest scientific reasoning skills and the highest FCI gains.  Data from IE introductory physics courses using modeling at Edward Little High School in Maine show a similar result, with some additional data showing a reverse gender gap for those students with very weak scientific reasoning skills.

In upper division electricity and magnetism, the manipulation and interpretation of vector functions is pervasive and a significant challenge to students. At CSU San Marcos, using in-class activities adapted from the Oregon State University Paradigms in Physics Curriculum, students' difficulties with vector functions become evident in two types of in-class activities: sketching vector functions and relating vector and scalar functions (e.g., electric field and electric potential). For many students, the cause of these difficulties is a failure to fully distinguish between the components of a vector function and its coordinate variables. To address this difficulty, we implement an additional in-class activity requiring students to translate between graphical and algebraic representations of vector functions. We present our experience with these issues, how to address them, and how in-class activities can provide evidence of student thinking that facilitates curricular refinement.

How do we help students succeed and how do we assess their progress in such a course?

The role of assessment has been critical at three very different scales: (1) Formative assessment focused on the course itself in the design phase; (2) Formative assessment focused on students in the instructional phase; and (3) Summative assessment to determine student performance and the success of course design. We summarize the role and nature of assessments at each of these levels.  At the design scale, investigative measures include observations and surveys of students and student work. In the classroom, assessments to determine and address student difficulties include clicker questions, class activities, and tutorials. At the summative scale, assessments include faculty interviews and course and tutorial-scale posttests. We discuss the development of these different layers of assessments, provide a sampling of new materials, summarize summative outcomes, and outline ongoing challenges to sustainability.

It's becoming common for physics courses to utilize active engagement and social learning.  However, newest innovative curricula aim not only to improve content knowledge, but also include helping students develop practices and skills of authentic scientists. To students, this is often very different from their previous learning experiences in terms of behavioral expectations, attitude, and what learning means. Consequently, students must modify their identity as learners to participate productively in this learning environment. Current assessments are very good at measuring development of conceptual understanding, basic scientific reasoning, and attitudes toward science, but do not address issues specific to these innovative  courses.  We developed a 49-item survey to assess students' 1) expectations of student and teacher roles, 2) self efficacy towards skills supported in the Investigative Science Learning Environment and 3) attitudes towards social learning. Using principle components exploratory factor analysis, we established eight factors that measure these three characteristics.

In the Paradigms in Physics Curriculum at Oregon State University, we take a spins-first approach to quantum mechanics using a java simulation of successive Stern-Gerlach experiments to explore the postulates.  The experimental schematic is a diagrammatic representation that we use throughout our discussion of quantum measurements.  With a spins-first approach, it is natural to start with Dirac bra-ket language for states, observables, and projection operators.  We also use explicit matrix representations of operators and ask students to translate between the Dirac and matrix languages.  The projection of the state onto a basis is represented with a histogram.  When we subsequently introduce wave functions, the wave function attains a natural interpretation as the continuous limit of these discrete histograms or of a projection of a Dirac ket onto position or momentum eigenstates.  We are able to test the students' facility with moving between these representations in later modules.

One of the mathematical objects that students become familiar with in thermodynamics, often for the first time, is the partial derivative of a multivariable function. The symbolic representation of a partial derivative and related quantities present difficulties for students in both mathematical and physical contexts, most notably what it means to keep one or more variables fixed while taking the derivative with respect to a different variable. Material properties are themselves written as partial derivatives of various state functions (e.g., compressibility is a partial derivative of volume with respect to pressure).  Research in courses at the University of Maine and Oregon State University yields findings related to the many ways that partial derivatives can be represented and interpreted in thermodynamics. Research has informed curricular development that elicits many of the difficulties using different representations (e.g., geometric) and different contexts (e.g., connecting partial derivatives to specific experiments).

The practice of proximal formative assessment depends on students' sharing their ideas with instructors and on teachers' attending to them.  Normal classroom conditions, characterized by mutual evaluation and attention to learning targets, present threats to students' and teachers' sense of their own competence and value.  Students who feel threatened tend to conceal their ideas; teachers who feel threatened have difficulty attending to students' ideas.  This necessary self-protection on the part of learners and teachers depletes the classroom of information that could be valuable for instruction.  In contrast, discourse patterns characterized by positive anticipation and attention to learner ideas increase the potential for proximal formative assessment and promote self-directed learning.  Episodes of classroom video illustrate these effects.

Students' reasoning regarding electric field concepts was analyzed by pre- and post-instruction responses to two related questions on the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism; both multiple-choice responses and written explanations were examined. Although nearly half of all students gave correct pre-instruction responses on one of the questions, their written explanations made it clear that many either based their correct answers on vague or inconsistent "intuitive" thinking, or they simply guessed. These explanations, along with inconsistent responses on the related question, showed that most correct pretest answers on this item were not genuinely indicative of conceptual understanding. By contrast, most correct post-instruction responses to the same question were accompanied by acceptable explanations, as well as by matching correct responses on the related item. Thus the same (correct) response on a particular multiple-choice question had dramatically different interpretations regarding students' thinking depending on whether it had been given pre- or post-instruction.

When solving two integrals arising from the separation of variables in a first order linear differential equation, students have multiple correct choices for how to proceed. They might set limits on both integrals, use integration constants on both, or on only one equation. In each case, the physical meaning of the mathematics is equivalent. But, how students choose to represent the mathematics can tell us much about what they are thinking. Typically, limits indicate more physical thinking, constants more mathematical thinking. Furthermore, evidence for the way they interpret the physical situation is found in choices of limits or constants. At the University of Maine, using a resources (knowledge-in-pieces) framework, we organize these results to show the many skills needed in solving seemingly simple integrals.

An introductory physics course at Georgia Tech requires students learn numerical computation for describing physical phenomenon that are not amenable to being solved using analytic methods. Students' motivation to learn computation and anxiety about solving computational exercises varies greatly. The attitudes, interests, and values that students exhibit when learning a subject can play a role in their motivation to and anxiety about learning the subject. We present a brief overview of the development of a new tool, the Computation Modeling in Physics Attitudinal Student Survey (COMPASS), aimed at helping to characterize students' attitudes about, interests in, and values concerning computation as well as preliminary measurements derived from this instrument.

For 30 years, research on the effects of high-stakes testing in K-12 schools has documented the negative effects of teaching to the test.  Most obvious is the reduction or elimination of time spent on science and social studies instruction, especially in high poverty schools.  Less obvious is the harm to student learning in reading and mathematics when instruction is limited to repetitive drill on worksheets that closely resemble test formats.  The lack of generalized, flexible understanding of underlying principles in K-12 tested subjects is similar to Mazur's experience with plug-and-chug versus conceptual test questions.  The PER community is well aware of the importance of more complete representation of learning goals as a remedy to this problem.  Equally important, however, are the assessment "processes," especially feedback and grading, that can either promote or deter students' engagement and willingness to take responsibility for their own learning.  In this talk, I summarize learning and motivation research that has particular bearing on effective classroom assessment practices, in K-12 classrooms certainly, but even in university courses.

Interactive engagement (IE) methods provide instructors with evidence of student thinking that can guide instructional decisions across a range of timescales: facilitating an activity, determining the flow of activities, or modifying the curriculum. Thus, from the instructor's perspective, IE activities can function as formative assessments. As a practical matter, the ability to utilize this potential depends on how the activities are implemented. This talk will describe different tools for small group problem solving, including whiteboards, Tablet PCs, digital cameras, and photosharing websites. These tools provide the instructor with varying levels access to student work during and after class, and therefore provide a range of support for formative assessment. Furthermore, they differ in physical size, ease of use, and the roles for students and instructor. These differences lead to complex, often surprising interactions with classroom practices.

What do we want students to know and be able to do in disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry or Biology?  How do we determine whether students are attaining our objectives? How can we use this information to improve student outcomes? Questions about defining and assessing competence are at the heart of the science education enterprise and they continue to challenge educators across K-16+.  This presentation will provide concrete examples of how best to frame and address these issues using examples drawn from my work on the redesign of AP science courses and exams, my participation in developing the NRC Conceptual Framework for new Science Education Standards, and ongoing research on the validity and utility of instruments such as STEM concept inventories.  A major point of the presentation is that principled assessment design should be an essential and driving part of the process of designing powerful and effective science learning environments.

The  ACS Exams Institute has been producing norm-referenced exams in chemistry for over 75 years. Over the past decade, demands for assessment within chemistry education have increased, and the need has grown to consider additional ways to analyze data or develop assessment tools.

Topics include, item-order effects, criterion referencing of exam items and differential item functioning.

Standards-based grading is gaining popularity at the high school level, including physics courses. The basic notion is to give your students a list of objectives upfront that they need to master. Students can reassess often and their final grade is determined solely by their last reassessment on each standard. Its the instructors job to help students find ways of showing their mastery to you. I implemented this in a junior-level mechanics course where the small numbers allowed me to introduce a novel twist: all assessments had to include students voice. This meant that students turned in pencasts, screencasts, and in-person assessments. Several days were also set aside for collaborative oral assessments, where students offered up honest advice and scores were mutually determined. In this talk, Ill share my experience trying out this pedagogical experiment and try to convey how it has improved my  own understanding of my students understanding.

Assessment in classrooms is often viewed as the responsibility of teachers. They typically serve as the ones judge the quality of work and advise students about necessary steps to make progress towards conceptual gains. By and large, then, assessment is something done by teachers to students.  When students are involved in assessment, it is often as recipients and users of feedback from teachers. There's an analog to this in science.  Assessment encompasses the process of peer review, when community members make judgments about the quality of work and provide feedback in reviews, and when funders decide whether to provide support to a research program.  However, in science, assessment also operates on a different level; assessment of ideas is intimately connected to doing science. In this talk, we examine the relationship between assessment and learning in science and in schools. We argue for engaging students in disciplinary assessment activities and for better coordinating the different purposes and roles for assessment.

Computation (the use of the computer to solve numerically, to simulate, or to visualize a physical problem) has revolutionized scientific research and engineering practice. However, computation is virtually ignored in most introductory college courses. 

In this targeted session, we present an overview of efforts to introduce computation undertaken in both high school and large enrollment university mechanics courses. Several key questions are highlighted for discussion. How can computation be introduced into courses that have a wide variety of student skill levels? How can students' abilities to use computer modeling be evaluated? What challenges do students face when developing a computer model? What is the role of epistemology for students who are learning this new tool?

Many instructors across the country, particularly those teaching by non-traditional methods or interested in modifying their teaching techniques or curricula, find themselves in need of a more comprehensive assessment instrument. They would like to evaluate their instructional methods through a broader assessment of their students skills, including laboratory, modeling (conceptual and mathematical), problem solving and critical thinking skills, assessed in the context of physics. They would like an instrument that can be used to compare their students performance to that of other students nationwide.

 In this targeted poster session, we will discuss the pros and cons of existing assessment instruments, which include assessments such as conceptual inventories and pre- and post-testing (mostly local), present work on assessments that go beyond conceptual inventories, and the need for broader, more comprehensive assessments, including examples of assessment instruments that might be useful to serve as a prototype.

Multiple-choice tests are used frequently in physics education as tools for assessing student learning.  These assessments are often used to evaluate research-based curricula/pedagogies because they can be administered to a large student population, and are easy to grade, compare and analyze quantitatively.  However, even with research-based multiple-choice tests, students' thought process is not revealed very well by the test answers alone. This session will showcase posters with examples of research highlighting advantages and limitations of multiple-choice assessments. These issues include correlation between students' performance on carefully designed multiple-choice tests and the same problems administered in a free-response format and graded on a rubric, gender effects, and other factors.

Classically, formative assessment has been considered in terms of changes made to lesson plans as a result of diagnostic testing.  Proximal formative assessment is teachers' continual, responsive attention to learners' developing understanding as it is expressed verbally moment to moment:  the process by which teachers carefully attend to specific aspects of individual learners' developing understanding, as instruction is taking place in real time (Erickson, 2007; Heritage, 2010).  This is among the most subtle and challenging of formative assessment practices, yet is the one with perhaps the most potential impact on a teacher's ongoing activities in the classroom.  This poster session will present research on proximal formative assessment being conducted for the Energy Project in the Department of Physics at Seattle Pacific University.

Upper-division students must learn to apply sophisticated mathematics from algebra, limits, calculus, multi-variable and vector calculus, linear algebra, complex variables, and ordinary and partial differential equations. The presenters in this session will discuss how the representations that we choose may affect whether students are able to use this mathematics spontaneously and correctly, whether they can move smoothly between representations, and the extent to which their understanding of the mathematics enhances their understanding of the physics. The discussant will incorporate the perspective of research in undergraduate mathematics education as it applies to the representations that have been presented.

We are investigating interactions with student-driven, multi-level homework as part of our Integrated Learning Environment for Mechanics.  Student-driven means that students choose their assignment from a set of easy (fewest points), medium, and hard (most points) problems subject to accruing a specific number of total points.  Problem levels were determined a priori based on the cognitive load of the required tasks [1] and our opinion of overall challenge.  We are assessing student interactions and performance on these problems in a number of ways: item response theory, time on task, and choice of level. We will present our findings and discuss further studies of the impact that multi-level, student-driven assignments have on students learning.

Most rubrics are designed to satisfy the following purposes: setting the learning goals, helping the instructor to determine where the students are, providing a scale for assigning grades. In our physics class we would like to achieve one more purpose: to use rubrics to guide students toward self-directed learning. We designed a homework rubric with only three items. This made the rubric easy for students to understand and easy for the instructor to implement. The three-item-rubric focuses on requiring students to reflect on their own thought processes, check consistency between representations, and evaluate the result. In the process, students slowly become accustomed to the complex process of self-directed learning. Through the process of reflection and self-evaluation, students also gain confidence in their own understanding before they receive the instructors feedback. By the end of the semester students were able to demonstrate the ability to learn on their own.

Students demonstrate different levels of understanding of material which often coincide with how diligent the students are with their daily preparation for class. Having them attempt homework problems prior to class enables them to be better prepared to ask specific questions about concepts and to perform on exams, as well as to develop as self learners. This paper will introduce phased-array homework which is a flexible system of assigning homework. In addition, this paper discusses resources for students that provide a scaffold for completing this type of homework. As the name of the homework system implies, phased-array homework (PAH) allows an instructor to shape and steer student understanding in much the same way that a phased-array antenna allows for the shaping and steering of a transmitted electromagnetic signal to yield its subsequent effective radiation pattern. Implementation method and results will be presented as well as student perspective on the system.

We report on RAWR, a new web-based system for monitoring student understanding of a wide range of introductory physics concepts throughout the term. RAWR rests upon a novel application of between-student testing to university physics courses during the time of instruction. Data collected during the alpha-testing phase on over 1200 students at Rochester Institute of Technology will be presented, as will examples of a variety of statistical analyses that are available to the  participating instructor.  Because large student numbers improve statistical analysis, it is particularly appropriate for large enrollment classes. RAWR enters the beta-testing stage at a number of external institutions in Fall 2012.

Model-based reasoning in physics requires, among other skills, the use of deductive reasoning.  In two different contexts -- pencil and paper problems requiring qualitative reasoning, and computational activities modeling system dynamics -- we have observed that many science and engineering students in the introductory calculus-based course do not appear to be employing even simple formal deductive logic.   One of our studies focuses on modeling student deductive reasoning as a search through possibility space.  Another study focuses on designing tasks to keep students focused on a model rather than intuitive guessing, by asking them to predict the behavior of an incomplete model.  Understanding how students actually approach model-based deduction can inform the design of instruction in this and future courses (especially relativity and quantum mechanics) that rely heavily on students' ability to reason formally and their confidence in the results of such reasoning.

The qualities of an effective teacher have been an enduring question in science education research. In particular, the roles of superior content knowledge, of pedagogical content knowledge, and of experience in teaching have been identified as important factors.  The present study examines the role of teacher reasoning ability. Reasoning ability was assessed in four different introductory physics courses with varying degrees of inquiry-based instruction.  An analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant differences in gains between inquiry-based formats and traditional, lecture-based courses in favor of the active learning teaching style. The significance of this on the training of pre-service teachers as well as the professional development of in-service teachers is discussed in view of a second study which indicates that teachers scientific reasoning ability correlates extremely well with the measured scientific reasoning ability of the students they have taught.

Data from several years and several different classes have shown that Lawson test scores do not change much over the course of a single semester, and are strongly correlated with FCI gains. So what does change Lawson scores? We have new data that we think shows that more interaction with materials that demand reasoning (and not just clicker questions and end of chapter Homework problems) improves reasoning ability and subsequently conceptual development.

We all want the students to achieve higher level reasoning and learning. There are lots of reformed physics curricula that focus on teaching those higher level skills. However, most instructors struggle to come up with matching exam questions that will assess those higher level skills. In this workshop, we will examine the common assessments: homework and exams. We will discuss how to turn the regular end-of-chapter question into a question that requires students to apply higher level thinking and reasoning. We will also talk about some unusual places to look for possible homework and exam questions. Participants are strongly encouraged to bring a copy of their own final exam to the workshop for analysis and discussion.

Individual interviews are often considered the gold standard for researchers interested in understanding how people think about a phenomena.  However, conducting and analyzing interviews is very time consuming.  This workshop will present the group-administered-interactive-questionnaire as an alternative to individual interviews and engage researchers in discussions about the pros and cons of alternative data collection methods.  We will discuss our experiences with both types of data collection tools in the context of understanding instructors beliefs about problem solving.  Both tools made use of an "artifact comparison" technique intended to mimic the instructional decision-making.  The group-administered-interactive-questionnaire replaced the probing of a one-on-one interview with a group task preceded and followed by individual questionnaires.  Workshop participants will compare these data collection tools to identify key design features.  Collaborative analysis of data collected in both approaches will examine their validity and reliability in clarifying respondents' intentions.

Inventing a general explanation for contrasting cases is an effective learning strategy (Schwartz, Chase, Oppezzo, & Chin, 2011).  Inventing activities implicitly ask students to compare and contrast cases.  Is compare and contrast alone enough?  Over 4 class periods, 6th grade students learned about horizontal projectile motion through Compare and Contrast (CC) instruction or Invention (INV) activities using identical contrasting cases generated by a Physics Education Technology (PhET) computer simulation. Results showed that the INV treatment led to superior learning outcomes over the CC condition.  Worksheet analyses revealed that CC students mainly focused on single factor features, whereas the inventing directive led students to focus on finding an overall explanation. As a result, the INV students were more likely to give deeper structure accounts of the features that could explain all the contrasting cases.  Comparing and contrasting is necessary for induction but not sufficient for finding deep structure in physics.

Students views about physics and learning of physics exert a great influence on the way they study this subject matter. Those who perceive physics as a coherent scientific enterprise consisting of interconnected knowledge resources are likely to approach physics differently than those who view it as a laundry list of disconnected bits-and-pieces of facts or formulas. Although many physics classes are intended to cultivate student scientific learning attitudes, prior research has shown that typical instruction often resulted in a lesser alignment of students views about physics with those of experts. Much work along this line has been carried out in the US, and only a few studies were aimed at international students. We report here a cross-grade study of Chinese students views about physics and learning of physics using the Colorado Learning Attitudes Survey about Science. Results that reveal the trend of change in student learning attitudes are reported.

Modeling, the practice of developing, testing, and refining models of physical systems, is gaining support as a key scientific practice, and is included in the new Framework for K-12 Science Education released by the National Research Council. Modeling Instruction, RealTime Physics, Matter & Interactions, and other model-based curricula have introduced a modeling emphasis to many classrooms at the high school and introductory college level, but there has been little move to include modeling in the upper-division lecture or lab courses. In this poster we present a framework for adopting modeling into existing lab courses as part of general strategy for scientific inquiry. We also present a model of laboratory modeling that includes modeling the physical and measurement systems and their relationship. We elucidate the framework through the specific example of a polarization of light lab.

At Florida International University we have implemented a learning assistant program (LAP) based on the Colorado Learning Assistant Model.[1] As a part of this program, students take a course on science and mathematics education theory and practice in which they are required to submit written reflections. The purpose of this study is to determine if students writing assignments provide evidence that they are reflecting on their teaching experiences and to characterize the different ways in which they reflect on those experiences. In our investigation we adapted a rubric from Hatton and Smith[2]. We show how this rubric helps us to categorize the depth of student reflections and provide them with constructive feedback.

It has been observed in the literature that student self-confidence about mathematical ability tends to be reduced by attending a selective secondary school.  This has been termed the Big-Fish-Little-Pond Effect".  We have examined CLASS data from the mainstream introductory physics course at MIT and found evidence of an analogous decline in confidence about physics problem solving ability, even among students receiving an A or B in the course.  This decline is apparently correlated with a student's subsequent selection of major.  Students who eventually select a major closely related to physics do not (on average) exhibit a significant decline in self-confidence during the freshman course, regardless of gender.  Students whose major has no close relationship to physics do (on average) exhibit a significant decline in confidence regardless of gender.  Students whose major is intermediate display a gender-dependent evolution of confidence, with only female students (on average) exhibiting a significant decline.

These cohorts preformed significantly better than their in class peers in many courses.

Preliminary results indicate that a cohort effect played a significant roll in the success of students. For example study habits and achievement norms are common themes of the interviewees.

After learning Newtons 2nd Law, students in a university modeling-based introductory physics class are asked to imagine a box sliding across a floor and slowing to a stop. Although theyve had extensive experience with friction in the context of energy, this is their first exposure to friction within the context of forces.

They are asked to make different representations for this scenario, including a system schema, and force diagram.  During their small group work, students quickly run into a difficulty:  there are only two interactions with the box (contact, gravitational), so there should only be two forces, yet the box is slowing, which means it must have unbalanced forces in the direction of acceleration.

In this poster, I present evidence from the student-lead whole class discussion showing how the class uses the System Schema to help reason about this problem in a productive manner and come to a useful consensus.

Prior to taking a translated version of Open Source Tutorials [1] (OSTs) as a stand-alone course, most students at Tokyo Gakugei University had experienced physics as memorizing laws and equations to use as computational tools.   We might expect students entering this reformed physics class, which emphasizes common sense and conceptual reasoning and rarely invokes equations, to produce students who see a disconnect between equation use and intuitive/conceptual reasoning.  Many students at Gakugei, however, somehow learned to reconcile quantitative problem solving with conceptual understanding even though OSTs do not emphasize this process.    Tadao, for example, came to see that although a common-sense solution to a problem is preferable for explaining to someone who doesnt know physics, solving the problem with a quantitative calculation (that connects to physical meaning) can bring clarity and concreteness to communication between experts.   How this reconciliation occurred remains an open question and a candidate for future research.

Postgraduate students who transfer from Historically Black Universities to the National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme (NASSP) that is run at the University of Cape Town often struggle academically.  While our previous studies on student epistemology went some way towards understanding student performance it became clear that broader socio-cultural and systemic issues were playing critical roles. Using Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) as a theoretical perspective we (a) characterized the broader context as an Activity System and (b) identified the four main levels of systemic contradictions as proposed by the theory. We present findings from studies involving various cohorts of students.  One of the components of the curriculum that presented particular difficulty was an intermediate level Electromagnetism course. We therefore analysed this as a subsystem identifying several systemic and historical tensions.

Computer modules designed  to improve problem solving skills for science and engineering students are currently in the process of being experimentally tested in a calculus-based physics course by the PER group at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities (Q.

Additional branches of the study include adapting the coaches to suit the needs of a) different institution types, and b) students of other intended majors, e.g. science education majors and life science majors. At the University of Central Arkansas, we are currently preparing a study to recruit high school teachers to test the modules in an interview format and determine the feasibility and pedagogical use for implementation in a senior high school physics class.  Additional considerations include computational design and life science applications for both college and high school levels of physics.

The introductory physics course, Physics 7, was radically reformed 16 years ago in order to explicitly emphasize the development of scientific reasoning skills in all elements of the course(1). We have previously reported on increased performance in MCAT biological and physical science scores(1,2), in a rigorous systemic physiology course(2), and higher junior/senior GPAs(1) for students who took Physics 7 rather than a traditionally taught introductory physics course.  We report here on significantly increased performance by biological-science majors in a general chemistry course when they take the first quarter of Physics 7 prior to beginning the chemistry sequence instead of taking general chemistry prior to beginning introductory physics(3).

Guided instruction can focus students on concepts to be learned, but can reduce student agency and ownership of learning. Over the last two years, we have implemented PhET computer simulations in middle school (MS) classrooms and found that open play can allow increased student agency and simultaneously lower barriers for student-centered pedagogy. In these MS classes, activities begin with 5 minutes of open play where students use simulations without instruction. A moderately-guided, inquiry-based activity follows. In focus groups, MS students articulate that they value the play time because it is fun and because it allows them to become familiar with the simulation. These students simultaneously express that the written activities are important for learning specific content. In a study of classes with play versus no-play, we found that with play, the teacher focused on student ideas and science content, while without play the teacher employed more direct instruction.

Graduate teaching assistants (TAs) play an important role in introductory physics courses, particularly in large enrollment courses where the TA may be viewed as more approachable and accessible than the lecture instructor. Thus, while TAs may still be in the process of developing their views on teaching physics, their practices directly influence a large number of introductory students. As the first steps reforming our introductory courses and TA training program, we collected multiple types of data on TAs teaching in traditional algebra-based physics laboratories. Recently, the beliefs, practices and training of TAs have drawn the attention of several researchers. Drawing on prior work on TAs pedagogical knowledge, we explore how the beliefs expressed by TAs in interviews align with their practices during a laboratory video-taped mid-semester. Additionally, we explore how both the TAs expressed beliefs and practices align with students responses to an end-of-semester TA evaluation survey.

We present a qualitative analysis of a group of students working through a task designed to build connections between biology, chemistry, and physics. During the discussion members of the group explicitly index some of the ideas being presented as coming from chemistry and from physics. While there is evidence that students seek coherence between outside knowledge and in-class knowledge, there is little evidence of reasoning with one another's ideas, resulting in a lack of reconciliation. In this talk we present evidence that the difficulty students face in trying to reconcile each other's ideas can be understood through a positional identity lens. We examine how students position themselves and each other as experts and novices and explore how this positioning contributes to the lack of the reconciliation of ideas for these students.

There have been several studies in recent years that have demonstrated that upper-division students struggle with partial derivatives and the complicated chain rules ubiquitous in thermodynamics. We asked several experts (primarily faculty who teach thermodynamics) to solve a challenging and novel thermodynamics problem to understand how they navigate through this maze. What we found was a tremendous variety in solution strategies and sense-making tools, both within and between individuals. This case study focuses on one particular expert: his solution path and use of sense-making tools. This expert was also asked to work the same problem using differentials (an approach taught in the Paradigms in Physics: Energy and Entropy course). This presentation will also discuss his reflections on how a differential method compared to his own approach and on the utility of using differentials in teaching undergraduates.

Teaching Assistants (TAs) play an important role in supporting research-based instructional environments, yet the connection between TAs pedagogical beliefs and instructional practices is not well understood. We build upon a broad foundation of research on the nature of pedagogical content knowledge to develop an analytic framework for characterizing how physics TAs both describe and enact their roles as teachers. In a previous work (PERC 2011), we outlined a framework for TA pedagogical beliefs and highlighted examples of emergent differences between TAs along one particular dimension, agency. In this paper, we extend this framework to include TAs instructional goals, and their methods & purpose of assessment. Using examples drawn from several semesters of interviews and classroom videotape, we apply this framework and describe instances of both strong and weak coordination between TA beliefs and practices.

We use the theory of conceptual blending with material anchors to describe how people make meaning of the vector arrows representation of electric fields. We describe this representation as a conceptual blend of a spatial (coordinate) input space and an electric-field-as-arrows space (which itself is a blend of electric field concept with arrows).  This representation possesses material features including the use of spatial extent (e.g., distance on paper) to represent the coordinate space and to represent the magnitude of electric field vectors. As a result, this representation supports a geometric interpretation of the electric field, breaking the field into components, and the addition of two fields at a point. The material features also emphasize the spatial relationships between the source(s) and points where the field is represented. However, the material features also necessitate sampling and do not generally support the rapid superposition of two fields at all points. We illustrate this analysis with examples from clinical problem-solving interviews with upper-division physics majors, and interpret students' errors in using this representation as resulting from conflict between the input spaces in the blend.

Calibration is an aspect of Metacognition that describes how well students assess their own knowledge. One tool that can help to assess student calibration is the Knowledge Survey (KS). On a KS, students rate their confidence in their ability to answer questions related to course content. A comparison of a students confidence level with their actual performance on course exams gives an indication of the students metacognitive calibration. We report on a study that explores students responses to a KS in introductory physics and chemistry courses serving both STEM and non-STEM populations. In many courses, Delta (the difference between KS-score and Final Exam score, a measure of calibration) was anti-correlated with Final Exam performance. No relationship was found between Delta and students scientific reasoning abilities. We also report preliminary findings on how calibration differs for questions of a quantitative nature vs. those of a more conceptual nature.

A pre- and post- survey was conducted during an introductory calculus-based physics course to assess students' basic skills in error-propagation. Additionally, students participated in a "think-pair-share" activity during the course. Overall, based on the surveys, students improved, especially in the case where they did not have any misconceptions initially. Qualitative assessment of the think-pair-share activity contrasts with the results of the post-survey.

Physics courses ideally facilitate both students understanding of fundamental physical principles, as well as strengthen students problem solving repertoire. In this study we look at how students divide and/or aggregate various elements of problem statements and how useful distinct principles and concepts, formulae, and general problem contexts are for pairing problems assigned in the same week. Students in an algebra-based physics course were asked to choose two problems from each of their homework assignments which they found to be most similar. The two problems selected were then explicitly compared and contrasted in writing.   The written statements were then divided by clause topics and further categorized into levels of epistemic reasoning. This paper/poster presents the qualitative analysis used and provides observed trends that appear in students homework responses.

Over the past two decades education researchers have demonstrated that various types of knowledge, including pedagogical content knowledge, influence teachers' instructional practices and their students learning opportunities. Findings suggest that by engaging in the work of teaching, teachers acquire knowledge of how students think, but the education research community has not yet captured this learning as it occurs. We examined whether novice physics instructors can develop such knowledge via the activities of attending to student work and have identified several mechanisms that supported instructors in building this knowledge. We analyzed data from interviews with physics graduate teaching assistants as they examined and discussed students' written work. During those discussions, some instructors appeared to develop new knowledgeeither about students thinking or about the physics contentand others did not. We compare and contrast three cases representing a range of outcomes and identify factors that enabled some instructors to build new knowledge.

Economic challenges over the past few years have had adverse effects on reforming introductory physics laboratory instruction at Appalachian State.  An administrative decision for the Fall, 2011 semester to save money by switching from weekly, two-hour lab meetings to three-hour meetings every other week resulted in declines in student performance (via an FCI1-based diagnostic) and attitudes (via CLASS1).  Pressure to increase student enrollment to offset the decline in state support has prompted other science programs to consider similar changes to laboratory instruction.  In this paper, we will discuss our student performance and attitude results.  We will also highlight our attempts to leverage assessment data to safeguard reform efforts in the sciences, especially in terms of program reviews and accreditation processes.

Khalifa Universitys College of Engineering is among the first co-ed institutions in the Gulf Arab environment. We report on math, English and FCI test data that triangulate the difficulties in setting up a PER-motivated physics instruction method called Collaborative Workshop Physics (CWP). We focus on the process of training a large number of undergraduates whose math and English proficiency need to be improved before exposure to US-standard engineering curricula.  This report explores the existence of a threshold in elementary mathematics skills that may affect the overall success rate of our CWP method.  In addition, we report on the development of ELL-specific tools that enhance the quality of student interaction and help students identify with peers who share similar problems. Lastly, data from periodic student feedback on the effectiveness of cooperative groups in tutorials, lab problems and context-rich problems offer insight into changing attitude towards interactive engagement course.

This physics education research examines the impact of changing the classroom power structure on high school students participation, positioning, and views of themselves in relation to physics learning. Two classes of students traditionally underrepresented in physics were observed and interviewed in an urban high school using the Physics and Everyday Thinking (PET) curriculum. In the PET classroom, students collect and analyze data to produce, and come to consensus on, the ideas that are the targets for instruction. Findings indicate that students came to value and positively identify with the activities of physics through instruction that fosters a more dignified student experience than traditional approaches. Specifically, this experience was characterized by the valuing of students na�ve and developing understandings, the affordance of academically productive student talk and consensus building, and shifting the authority for validating science knowledge from the instructor to available laboratory evidence and social consensus.

As part of a large-scale investigation in how student understanding changes on a weekly basis throughout introductory calculus-based physics, we are curious about how students' epistemologies, sense of agency, and 'physics identity' change in response to instruction. The study collects data online using the EBAPS, CLASS, and SLIDe surveys from students enrolled at the Rochester Institute of Technology and The United States Military Academy at West Point.  Students' responses are correlated with their demographics and timing information to expand upon previous studies which show epistemology scores decreasing with time.

Technology-rich student-centered classrooms such as SCALE-UP and TEAL are designed  to actively engage students. We examine what happens when instructors adopt the classroom but not the pedagogy that goes with it. We measure the effect of using socio-technological spaces on students conceptual change and compare learning gains made in groups using different pedagogies (active learning vs. conventional instruction). We also interviewed 34 students to gauge their perceptions of the redesigned spaces as a function of the pedagogy they were exposed to.  Last, we correlate instructors self-reported instructional approach (teacher-centered vs student-centered) with the average normalized gains of their classes. Our findings suggest that technology-rich spaces are only effective when implemented with active pedagogies. Without active pedagogy, the technology-rich environment is not significantly different from conventional teacher-centered classrooms. We also find that students in socio-technological spaces differ in epistemic beliefs depending on the pedagogy they were exposed to. Students exposed to student-centered Active Learning had more expert-like epistemic beliefs than students exposed to teacher-centered approaches. We also find that instructors self-reported perception of student-centeredness accounts for a large fraction of the variance (R<sup>2</sup>=0.83) in their class average normalized gain. Instructors that adopted sociotechnological classrooms acknowledged the importance of student-centeredness. Though the classroom spaces were relatively easy to change, teachers pedagogies were not so easy to change. Our results suggest that adopting student-centered pedagogies is a necessary condition to the effective use of technology-rich student-centered spaces.

How does one define physics model?  How does one judge how good a model is?  In this study, I developed and used a coding scheme to examine a conversation in which a group of undergraduate freshmen attempt to answer these questions.  As part of a model-building course taught by the Compass Project at the University of California, Berkeley, students were asked to come to consensus on a definition for physics model.  Students brought up and argued about sixteen distinct claims to include in their definition.  I will present data and a coding scheme to characterize student and instructor moves that result in the acceptance or rejection of claims during the consensus-based discussion.

Developing the skills to set up integrals is critical for students success in calculus-based physics courses. It requires a high level of understanding of both math and physics concepts.  Previous studies have shown that students encounter a lot of difficulties when setting up integrals in the context of electricity and magnetism. However, the causes of students difficulties have not been carefully studied in the past.  In order to understand students solutions and mistakes from the resources perspective, we conducted group teaching/learning interview sessions with 13 engineering students enrolled in a second semeter introductory calculus-based physics course. Then we categorized the mathematics and physics resources activated by students  and used the representation of resource graphs to describe students coordination of various resources. The findings of this study provide further insights into the difficulties students encountered when applying integration in physics.

Thermodynamics is a core part of curricula in physics and many engineering fields.  Despite the apparent similarity in coverage, individual courses in each discipline have distinct emphases and applications.  Physics education researchers have identified student difficulties with concepts such as heat, temperature, and entropy as well as with larger grain-sized ideas such as state variables, path-dependent processes, etc.  Engineering education research has corroborated these findings and has identified additional difficulties unique to engineering contexts.  We are beginning a project that provides an excellent opportunity for expanding the interdisciplinary research on conceptual understanding in thermodynamics.  This project has two goals: first, determine the overlapping content and concepts across the disciplines; second, compare conceptual understanding between these groups using existing conceptual questions from PER and EER.  We will present a review of PER and EER literature in thermodynamics and highlight some concepts that we will investigate.

We compared the use of multimedia animations and written solutions to help students learn to solve physics problems requiring integration. Four problem solving tasks related to electricity and magnetism were designed. Initially all students attempted a pre-test problem. Then a solution to a different problem based on the same concept was shown to half of students as an animation and to the other half as a written solution. Finally, all students solved a post-test problem. Results indicate that on three out of four tasks, there was a statistically significant improvement in problem solving skills after watching both animation and written solutions.  However, no significant differences were found between the two groups.  We will present further details on how the animation and written solutions improved their problem solving skills and students views on the use of animation or written solutions.

We describe a study of the role of computational modeling in recognizing underlying similarities in different problems, a process called cognitive transfer. Previous studies have shown that this crucial process is highly sensitive to context, suggestion, and familiarity with the subject matter. We propose that courses emphasizing computational modeling, in which students repeatedly employ similar lines of code to model different physical systems, foster a more generalized cognitive transfer ability. We performed a think-aloud study on several students (some from a course involving computational modeling, others from a traditional physics course), exposing them to ordered pairs of problems of varying degrees of separation in specific details (molecular mechanics vs. projectile motion) and solution methods (numerical vs. analytical). With these data, we attempt to separate the influence of long-term instruction in computational modeling from the immediate priming effect of solving computational problems, and relate both to the promotion of cognitive transfer.

With the growing push to include computational modeling in the physics classroom, we are faced with the need to better understand students' computational modeling practices. While existing research on programming comprehension explores how novices and experts generate programming algorithms, little of this discusses how domain content knowledge can influence students' programming practices. "Epistemic games," which are coherent sequences of actions that are enacted to fulfill a particular set of expectations, explicitly link students' practices with their knowledge base. While these have generally been limited to describing analytic problem solving practices, they can also provide a means for addressing the interaction between content knowledge and programming practices. I will present a set of epistemic games which can be used, along with Resource Theory and framing, to describe novice students' computational modeling practices.

Conceptual Blending (Fauconnier & Turner, 2002) is a cognitive theory in which thinkers blend together new and old ideas to create conceptual networks capable of yielding new insights. The structure of these networks is heavily influenced by the frames and relative importance the thinker assigns to the different ideas being blended together. In this poster, we analyze examples of student problem solving and case reuse in introductory physics classes (Mateycik, 2009; Ward & Sweller, 1990) from the perspective of Conceptual Blending. We propose possible conceptual networks for different problem solving tasks and compare the structure and complexity of these networks. We find that the most effective problems for case reuse are those that cue for tightly integrated, easily compressible networks.

Entropy is typically not a central focus either in introductory university physics textbooks or in national standards for secondary education. However, entropy is a key part of a strong conceptual model of energy, especially for connecting energy conservation to energy degradation and the irreversibility of processes. We are developing a conceptual model of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics as they relate to energy, with the goal of creating models and representations that link energy and entropy in a meaningful way for learners analyzing real-life energy scenarios. We expect this model to help learners better understand how their everyday experiences relate to formal physics analyses. Our goal is to develop tools for use with elementary and secondary teachers and secondary and university students.

One thread in education research has been to investigate whether and in what ways students transfer their knowledge and use of particular concepts across disciplinary contexts . Such studies typically focus on the content of students knowledge.  For example, some studies investigate whether students who apply some knowledge in problem solving in a mathematical context can transfer that knowledge to solving a similarly structured physics problem.  We argue that in order to understand students reasoning across disciplinary contexts, we need to attend not just to their content knowledge, but also to their views on knowledge and learning (or epistemologies) in the disciplines.  We present the case of Will, a student working with two Taylor series approximation problems that were chosen to cue experiences from either math or physics. We aim to show that focusing on Wills epistemology aids our understanding of why he might reason differently across the two contexts.

Students may have greater difficulties to understand electric interactions since they have less daily experience compared to mechanics.  However, there might be a difference in understanding among different electric concepts like electric force and field. This work presents the results of students responses to two sequences of superposition principle isomorphic questions in which the only difference was that in one of the sequences, the electric force was used and on the other sequence, the electric field. We administered one of the sequences to 249 students at a large private Mexican university after covering electrostatics in an Electricity and Magnetism class. Answers, reasoning and drawings were analyzed. We found that students who took the force sequence can better answer correctly questions using the superposition principle than those students with the field sequence. The analysis of the students reasoning and drawing helped us to reveal students understanding of electric field.

An important goal of graduate physics core courses is to help students develop expertise in problem solving and improve their reasoning and metacognitive skills. We explore the conceptual difficulties of physics graduate students by administering conceptual problems on topics covered in the upper-level undergraduate physics courses before and after instruction in related first year core graduate courses. Here, we focus on physics graduate students' difficulties manifested by their performance on qualitative problems involving different representations of knowledge. We compare their performance with that of upper-level undergraduates. We also conduct individual discussions with various faculty members who regularly teach first year graduate physics core courses about the goals of the graduate core courses and the performance of graduate students on the conceptual problems after related instruction in core courses. We will present the findings.

In Spring 2009 the physics program at the University of Wisconsin  Platteville moved into a new building with studio classrooms.  Although the classrooms were designed to allow for more interactive engagement in the introductory physics classes, they are still compatible with lecture instruction, and instructors are free to adopt any teaching style they wish.  The Force Concept Inventory (FCI) was administered to students in 31 sections of calculus-based introductory mechanics from Spring 2008 through Spring 2012.   The 31 sections were taught by 12 different instructors with varying teaching styles.  Each section was assigned a studio index (SI) based on the amount and diversity of active learning and interactive engagement.  The FCI normalized gain increased steadily with increasing SI for students of all abilities as measured by their grades in the class.

Students' personal epistemology  their notions about the nature of knowledge and learning  affect how they approach learning. These personal epistemologies have usually been conceptualized as originating in students past experiences and recruited in particular learning contexts. Drawing on a case study based on a clinical interview with an electrical engineering major ("Rebecca") in an introductory physics class, we argue that in some instances, students' projected sense of their future profession - an aspect of their developing disciplinary identities - influences their approaches towards learning. Specifically, Rebecca positions herself as an electrical engineer and draws a distinction between her introductory mechanics course, which she sees as irrelevant to her future, and courses on digital logic and introductory electromagnetism, which she sees as relevant. She sees mechanics as less coherent than digital logic. She structures her learning in the two courses differently and reflects on how she draws on more rote-learning in physics, but deep sense making in digital logic design.

A critical goal in science education is to encourage minority students' continued interest and engagement in science (e.g., Bang & Medin, 2010; Basu & Calabrese Barton, 2007).  Here, we provide a case study of an eighth-grade student from Honduras, "Estevan," who first caught our attention in class for his dogged pursuit of trying to figure out how seasons occur on Earth.  We draw on interview and classroom data to demonstrate that what engages Estevan lies at the intersection of epistemology and identity.  Specifically, his epistemological stance toward science as figuring things out for oneself taps into his personal love of challenges, and this love of challenges is tied strongly to his sense of self.  We make the case for conceptualizing personal epistemology as deeply intertwined with aspects of identity, at least for some students, and we draw the implications of this perspective for classroom practice.

We present efforts to bring PER-based teaching methodologies to the United Arab Emirates at Khalifa University. A variant of cooperative group problem solving (CGPS) is selected for implementation in our introductory calculus-based mechanics course by following an engineering design-based approach that includes culturally-informed requirements. Course design evaluation begins by generating an evaluation matrix of requirements versus PER-based instructional strategies. Requirements for the course design emerge from an analysis using the frames of context approach introduced by N. Finkelstein. Our key consideration for generating design requirements is to answer how does the broader ethno-culture and campus idio-culture inform classroom expectations and formation of norms? By comparing published results for individual PER-based instructional strategies against the resulting requirements list, CGPS emerges as the likely candidate for an implementation attempt. We discuss initial results from the pilot implementation. We present this strategy as a modular, practical approach for designing cross-cultural secondary implementations in general.

There are many challenges and critiques of even the most commonly cited definitions of research validation, and no definition seems appropriate to every context. In this interactive poster, we will present some common definitions, along with challenges, critiques, requirements, and contexts in which each definition may or may not be appropriate.

Efforts to improve teaching in higher education have often focused on individual faculty.  However, there is a growing consensus that the academic department is a more productive focus of change initiatives.  Yet, academic departments are not all the same.  Understanding the structure of relationships within the department is important for identifying who should be involved in the change effort and in what roles.  It is also likely that a successful change effort will change the structure of relationships within a department.  This poster will present the preliminary results from a study of five academic departments at a research university.  A social network for each department was constructed based on a web survey that asked faculty to identify colleagues with whom they had teaching-related conversations.  Characteristics of the individuals and departments and their implications for change initiatives will be discussed.

Inspired by the success of pre-flight tutorials developed by physics faculty at UIUC, we are developing a series that are specifically tailored to students and faculty who use the innovative introductory text, Matter & Interactions: Modern Mechanics, by Ruth Chabay and Bruce Sherwood (Wiley). The M&I approach to mechanics (and electricity and magnetism) is distinctly different from that taken by more traditional texts. Our pre-flight tutorials will focus on those conceptual difficulties that have revealed themselves through over ten years of experience with M&I. Students will view the tutorials in advance of what would be a traditional lecture period and will be required to answer embedded questions in order to complete the assignment for course credit. The material presented in the tutorials will enable the course instructor to exercise Just In Time teaching, clicker questions that further probe student understanding, and any number of other pedagogically appropriate activities.

As an alternative to traditional teaching laboratories in an introductory mechanics course, we are developing laboratories incorporating both portable equipment kits used extramurally and real-time TA monitoring via electronic conferencing software.  Faculty surveys and literature reviews have identified several important elements of the laboratory experience.  These include: i) reinforcing content knowledge; ii) gaining research and measurement techniques; iii) solidifying understanding of experimental design, and iv) improving student confidence and attitude.  To ascertain whether the labs being created achieve the pedagogical aims of a teaching laboratory, we are designing a multifaceted assessment instrument examining each of these elements.  Once completed and validated, this instrument will serve as a comprehensive laboratory assessment tool that can provide an important function in the development of novel laboratory practices.  The poster presents the current status of the project and the assessment instrument and also outlines upcoming plans.

We present the development, validation, and preliminary results from the initial implementation of the survey in three undergraduate physics lab courses.

This study focuses on the identification of the students difficulties in electricity and magnetism using the CSEM (Conceptual Survey on Electricity and Magnetism). It is a 32-question, multiple-choice test developed by Maloney,O?Kuma, Hieggelke, and Heuvelen(2001),to assess students' knowledge about topics in electricity and magnetism. Based on results of the study, the top three difficult items are items number 16, 21 and 31. The topics covered by these items are: Work, electric potential, electric field and force; Magnetic force; and Faraday?s Law respectively, and the competencies related to these topics are: identifying the conditions for electromagnetic induction to occur; identifying the direction of the magnetic field, magnetic force and induced current involved in electromagnetic induction using right-hand-rule; interpreting the graphs of the induced current and voltage in Faraday?s law experiments; describing the motion of a charge in uniform magnetic field; relating the directions of the motion of a charge, the magnetic force and the magnetic field; identifying the relationship of the electric potential energy, charge and electric field; comparing the amount of work needed and the magnitude of the electric field in each cases and identifying the electric force exerted by the field and identifying the relative magnitudes and directions of the electric force given certain cases. Findings were used as basis for the development of intervention materials.

Astronomy education is characterized by fragmented coverage in K-12 education, caused by limited coherence across grades and a failure to emphasize the connections between explanations. The goal of this project is to develop a learning progression for Solar System formation that illustrates potential levels of sophistication that teachers can use to assess student progress.  The explanation for the  Solar Systems formation allows students to see the connections between the current physical and dynamic properties of the Solar System and the ways in which physics govern observable phenomena.  Such an approach is uncommon in most astronomy instruction, which focuses on celestial objects individually rather than as a coherent system.  Our learning progression was initially developed through the analysis of interviews with middle school, high school and college students.  We will also discuss our framework for iterative cycles of comparing student progress and instructional design to test our learning progression hypothesis.

We characterize the diversity of faculty practice at implementing a workshop-style introductory physics course through two complementary observational protocols: the Reform Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP) provides a summative assessment of fidelity to reform-teaching, while the Teaching Dimension Observation Protocol (TDOP) records direct practice.  Both are used used during the same observing period, facilitated by a new online template that allows TDOP entry through any web-enabled device. Despite the common environment and core materials, there is significant variance in RTOP score across faculty.  When comparing Mechanics and Electricity & Magnetism classes, we find a fundamentally different use of lecture in the two.  In Mechanics courses, faculty use lecture after student activities as a summative tool.  In E&M, however, lecture precedes student work, and is used in a "Tell & Practice'' manner.  We can also compare faculty practice in workshop and traditional-seating environments, surprisingly finding no significant difference between the two.

The instructors of six introductory calculus-based physics sections at Florida International University included a common question about force and acceleration on their final exams in the fall 2011 semester. We grouped the sections into Lecture, Lecture plus Recitation, and Inquiry-based Reformed Instruction. The exam question was broken down into two subparts: graphical representation and mathematical manipulation. We conducted statistical analyses to compare the total scores, as well as the scores of the subparts, between section groups. We determined that there is a statistically significant difference in scores from a both macro (total question points) and a micro (subpart points) view. We have also provided a brief overview of the differences in the representation use between sections.

The goal of this study was to examine a potential means for facilitating the translation of physics teachers conceptions of their subject matter into their work in the classroom. Teachers subject matter structures (SMS) were examined through a diagramming-and-interview format and were also separately examined in situ during their classroom practice. Treatment group teachers were asked to explicitly reflect on characteristics of their SMSs in comparison to their typical classroom practice. While a high level of congruence was evidenced between teacher-explicated SMSs and those SMSs inductively generated for both groups (treatment and control), those teachers deemed as possessing less pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) translated SMSs, and thus concepts, that were conceptually fragmented and compartmentalized. Implications highlight the challenges of both expediting the development of connected, and dynamic SMSs in teachers and for ensuring their subsequent translation into classroom practice in forms readily accessible to students (i.e., developing teachers PCK).

Several reasons have been proposed to explain students incorrect answers to conceptual physics problems.  Heckler (2011) proposed a reason with a perceptual basis: plausible and salient eye catching features in a problem capture students attention.  Once students attend to these perceptually salient features, less salient albeit thematically relevant features are not considered and students answer the problem incorrectly based on the salient features.  To test this hypothesis we recorded eye movements of introductory physics students on fifteen conceptual problems with diagrams.  Each diagram contained areas consistent with documented novice-like answers and other areas consistent with the scientifically correct answer.  We manipulated the luminance contrast of the diagrams to produce three versions of each diagram, which differed by the area with the highest level of perceptual salience.  We found no effect of the salience on the correctness of students answers.  We also discuss how the salience manipulations influence eye movements.

Mastering Physics (MP) scores and exam performance were tracked periodically throughout a two semester long (first run of) a new, calculus-based, introductory physics sequence.  In almost all cases, data indicated a statistically significant rank correlation between MP scores and exam scores. However, student assessments of the usefulness of MP were quite mixed. Further, scatter plots showed that MP score was not a particularly useful predictor of individuals exam performance  nor was exam performance a useful predictor of current MP score.   In this work, we present our data and propose plausible explanations for the apparent anomalies.

A series of video examples is being produced where three actors work on a physics problem as students.  During key problem solving stages the actors make errors and correct them through group discussion.  Previous work (Gro?e and Renkl, 2007) suggests that incorrect examples may only provide a benefit for students with favorable prior content knowledge, and that correct solutions should be given first.  Muller et al. (2008) created videos where student actors presented physics misconceptions as truth, and then they refuted them.  This demonstrated greater learning gains than a traditional exposition that even included an explicit refutation of the misconception.  Our goal is to extend this idea to worked examples and test the videos against traditional exposition based video examples.  The purpose of this poster is to present the initial ideas of this research.  Videos are currently in production and data collection is scheduled for the Fall 2012 semester.

The addition of online pretests as a primer for learning is studied in an introductory inquiry based physics course designed for pre-service K-12 teachers.  The questions are designed to address misconceptions, elicit thinking about the material covered in the upcoming week and to alert students to the physical principles essential to the class material.  The pretests are paired with an online posttest component to both measure student gains as well as reinforce student learning.  The pretests are completed and machine-graded at the beginning of the week during which the content is covered in class, while the posttests are short answer corrections to the pretests completed at the end of the week.  The relationships between online tests and the learning of course content are investigated to determine a model for predicting success in the course.

Studies in the cognitive sciences have established that color, acting as an environmental cue, can significantly affect subject performance on a variety of tasks.  However, a dearth of research exists into how this phenomenon manifests itself 1) in the combined conceptual and computational field of physics and 2) in the context of preparation (i.e. where subjects are able to prepare for an assessment as opposed to first learning of its nature while testing).  Our experiment involves approximately 450 students in an introductory E&M course in which the paper color used for examinations was varied.  Analysis is performed across three exams and differentiates between students multiple choice, written response, conceptual, and computational performance.  The time students require to complete exams and confidence levels prior to and immediately following assessment are also examined.

We report on a study of student responses to questions about an open DC circuit when small representational, linguistic and circuit element variations are made. The 8 question instrument elicited an answer choice followed by a written explanation for the choice. Based on their responses students were selected for videotaped interviews. Our findings indicate that the changes significantly affected the way in which students responded. From the written explanations we identified a foothold idea that appeared more productive than others in activating appropriate reasoning across variational presentation. The interviews indicated that often what could superficially be ascribed to a lack of understanding in fact arose from sense-making efforts based on experiential episodes with hidden ambiguities. One provocative question arising from the study is to what extent findings pertaining to student understanding of DC circuits are valid when an instrument used is based solely on questions around light bulbs.

Though some basic intelligence is required to understand something, teachers can always facilitate the learning in such a way that the majority of students come to the desired learning level. We used two instruments: an IQ test to measure the students intelligence, and a pretest/posttest assessment about thermodynamics. We compared the learning of two groups of 14 year old students. One group participated in a cooperative learning environment and other in traditional instruction. First, students took the intelligence test, second they took the thermodynamics pretest. After these tests the teacher taught thermodynamics for two months. We measured the learning with the posttest. The group that participated in cooperative learning achieved greater learning. The effect of the cooperative learning was very useful for all the students, this methodology made that the least endowed intellectually achieved a notable even excellent profit. However, the traditional group did not achieve these satisfactory results.

Conceptual Blending (Fauconnier and Turner) is a cognitive theory in which thinkers generate new ideas by blending together old ideas, oftentimes successively.  In one perspective, blending is ubiquitous, rapid, and requires no visible effort on the part of the thinker (Turner).  In another perspective, to create and run a blend requires careful coordination of myriad resources and an attendant amount of effort on the part of the thinker (Podolefsky and Finkelstein). In this poster, we present analyses of blending from both the effortful and effortless perspectives on the same piece of data -- a student making sense of harmonic motion on a rotating platform -- and claims about why some blending is hard and other blending is easy.

Clickers, while perhaps not ubiquitous, have become very common in introductory physics classes where the audience is composed of students from a variety of majors.  They have also begun to see use in upper-division physics courses where the audience is almost entirely physics majors.  In this presentation we examine the hypothesis that these substantially different populations will result in different levels of participation and engagement.  We have videotaped the audiences of two introductory physics courses and two junior-level physics courses (mechanics and E&M in both cases) during clicker questions and quantified the level of engagement in each.  Preliminary results suggest that upper-division majors-only courses exhibit more peer-to-peer interaction and overall engagement than introductory courses.

We have undertaken a revision of our University Physics laboratory to address multiple learning outcomes defined by a departmental task force.  These include measurement skills, developing experimental procedures, analyzing data, technical writing, conceptual understanding, dealing with uncertainty, working in teams and having a positive experience.  We have collected data on student learning and experiences through the FMCE, student reports, survey and end of the semester practicum.  The results indicate improvements in some areas, as well as areas for further improvement.

Since 2009 we have been developing and evaluating visualizations and animations for the teaching and learning of quantum mechanics concepts at university level [Kohnle et al., Am. J. Phys., 80, 148 (2012)]. This poster describes the evaluation work guiding the design and content of the animations. Evaluation includes student questionnaires, a diagnostic survey to evaluate learning gains, observation sessions with a small number of student volunteers and observations during a teaching session in which students interact with animations. In this poster, we present multi-year data showing substantial learning gains on topics that had been covered in the animations by students that had used the animations compared with students that had not. We show the changes we have made in a single animation over a period of three years due to evaluation outcomes.

We describe a high school physics teachers pedagogical changes, observed during the process of the class working towards collective goals. The whole class developed these goals through the Cogenerative Mediation Process for Learning Environments (CMPLE), which was used to help all participants create an environment representative of their learning preferences. This poster highlights the pedagogical changes corresponding to the goal of showing all steps when explaining solutions on white boards, which we observed through classroom video and teacher interviews. Although the teacher previously had expectations that students show all of their steps, she hadnt always verbalized these expectations to her students, and the students tended to leave out steps while presenting their white boards.  Focusing on the CMPLE goals (based on student learning preferences) allowed her to address this issue in her teaching. Through the CMPLE mediation process, the teacher began to hold the students accountable, and they responded positively.

We are studying how students talk and gesture about physics problems involving directionality. Students discussing physics use more than words and equations; gestures are also a meaningful element of their thinking. Data come from one-on-one interviews in which students were asked to gesture about the sign and direction of velocity, acceleration, and other quantities. Specific contexts are a ball toss in the presence and absence of air resistance, including situations where the ball starts at greater than terminal velocity. Students show an aptitude for representing up to 6 characteristics of the ball with 2 hands. They switch quickly while talking about velocity, acceleration, and the different forces, frequently representing more than one quantity using a single hand. We believe that much of their thinking resides in their hands, and that their gestures complement their speech, as indicated by moments when speech and gesture represent different quantities.

Physics students views about what kinds of learning and knowledge-generating activities are expected in class, their epistemological framing, influences their reasoning and what they learn [1-2].  In previous work, we observed that students likelihood of correctly answering a kinematics question easily solved through common sense depended on whether preceding questions on the survey were designed to prime sense-making or schoolish answer-making [3]. To get insight into students reasoning on the survey we collected 24 think-aloud protocols [4].  The think-aloud data indicate some participants who incorrectly answered the kinematics question misinterpreted the physical situation it describes.  This observation might be seen as evidence the question lacks psychometric validity.  However, analysis indicates that students misinterpret the question because of how they frame their approach to answering it.  So, misinterpretation of the kinematics question is a signal of epistemological framing, not an impediment to seeing it.

Policy documents advocate for greater integration of physics and mathematics into biology curricula. However, there has been little research on how students make use of physics and mathematics in biological reasoning. To address this need, we examine how students use physics equations when discussing diffusion and circulation in interviews. We present two cases: one where a student leverages the specific algebraic form of these equations in building a biological explanation and one where this is not observed. By connecting analysis of observed reasoning patterns with their expressed epistemological beliefs, we highlight implications for thinking about the physics-biology integration. In particular, our findings suggest that making something quantitative just for the sake of making something quantitative does not necessarily add value and may have negative consequences for students expressed views about equations.

Our research group is developing a standardized fluids assessment, covering buoyancy and pressure.  Understanding buoyancy requires a battery of skills and knowledge, and we have designed questions to probe understanding of background concepts such as density, incompressibility, and volume of fluid displaced.  In this talk we will describe some of the buoyancy-related assessment questions, the misconceptions they probe, and the preliminary results from the beta version of the assessment.

Our research group is developing a standardized fluids assessment, covering buoyancy and pressure.  Much of the prior research of student difficulties with pressure involves younger children.  Many of the questions on the beta-version of the assessment used this past year were designed to test the prevalence of those difficulties in college students.  In this talk we will describe the pressure-related assessment questions, the misconceptions they probe, and the preliminary results from the beta version of the assessment.

Inquiry-based laboratory activities that emphasize scientific reasoning skills are better than more traditional alternatives, but how much design is too much? In this study, students in one semester of introductory physics are split into two different design-focused sequences of laboratory activities: heuristically scaffolded, ISLE-like (Rutgers) labs and largely exploratory, SCL-like (Maryland) labs. Both sequences are implemented over five bi-weekly meetings. Written reports were evaluated using the same rubrics as those used to assess scientific reasoning abilities in ISLE labs, so our findings are directly comparable with results reported from Rutgers. We observe slight differences between the two groups along some dimensions that seem to favor the more exploratory sequence, though our clearest observation is that five bi-weekly meetings is not sufficient for several important abilities. We elaborate on these findings and make suggestions for future implementation of these approaches to introductory laboratories.

Proficient problem solvers are able to interpret and use multiple representations of information (e.g. text, equations, pictures, diagrams, and graphs). In this study, introductory physics students viewed several kinematics graphs on a computer screen and were asked to select a numbered region of the graph corresponding to a text description of motion. We present an analysis of subjects performance on the items and eye-gaze fixation patterns recorded using an eye tracker.

We used the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) to assess changes in attitude during a general education course aimed at non-science majors.  The course is two semesters in duration, and both semesters were surveyed.  We analyzed data from over 1000 students in 26 different sections over three semesters.  With this study, we observe a variety of different attitudinal shifts in different sections.  In general one might expect that increases in favorable responses would be accompanied by decreases in unfavorable responses.  However, we observe some situations with increases in both favorable and unfavorable responses, and others with decreases in both.  We will present an analysis of the attitudinal shifts, and discuss factors, such as instructor and method of instruction, that might contribute to shifts in attitude.

This poster will discuss some results from the use of two-stage collaborative group quizzes in an introductory Electricity and Magnetism course. In these quizzes, students first take their quizzes individually and then take the same quiz again in collaborative groups. Immediate feedback is provided to the collaborative groups through a special type of scratch card which indicates to the group when they have answered a given multiple-choice question correctly. If they have not answered the question correctly, they are able to continue answering the question until they have discovered the correct answer.

This study presents a model, as well as its application, for the development of formative assessments in the classroom in a rurally located, city high-needs district in Ohio. Authors wrote common formative assessments (CFAs) for the teachers in seven categories: sixth, seventh, and eighth grade (middle school), and physical science, biology, environmental science, and physics (high school). Teachers provided feedback, CFAs were changed as necessary, and teachers analyzed the CFA at the both the beginning and the end of the quarter. Emphasis in the analysis was on what student thinking (expressed in writing) reveals. The pretests reveal what students think at the beginning, giving the teacher an idea of what ideas might already exist, right or wrong; the posttest should reveal to the teacher whether the instruction succeeded. Results indicate changes not only in the way teachers view their pedagogical approaches, but also in how teachers consider student personal epistemologies.

A great deal of research indicates that feeling a secure sense of belonging in academic settings is critical to students achievement. In the current work, we present data collected over multiple semesters of a calculus-based introductory physics class indicating that women feel a lower sense of belonging than men in physics. This finding is important because our data also indicate that having a strong sense of belonging in physics positively predicts the degree to which all students see the value of physics in their daily life  an outcome that predicts motivation and persistence in achievement settings  as well as performance on exams in the course. We identify one potential antecedent of womens relatively lower sense of belonging in physics, namely, negative cultural stereotypes about womens inferior ability in physics compared to men. We then discuss pedagogical strategies that might be employed to enhance womens sense of belonging in physics.

In a previous study, we learned that students who take a physics content course for elementary and middle school majors at the University of Kentucky leave the course with more confidence in their ability to do science. This follow-up investigation used surveys and interviews to isolate specific features of the course that contributed to and detracted from these gains in confidence. Hands-on activities, group projects, and a supportive instructor emerged among leading contributions, while frustration and lower-than-expected grades were found to be detractors. The interplay between students ownership of their own learning and frustration due to the difficult challenge of learning physics produces a tension that may be central to students confidence. Students responses are used here to better understand the impact of instructor attempts to negotiate that tension.

In statistical mechanics there are two quantities that directly relate to the probability that a system at a temperature fixed by a thermal reservoir has a particular energy. The density of states function is related to the multiplicity of the system and indicates that occupation probability increases with energy. The Boltzmann factor is related to the multiplicity of the reservoir and indicates that occupation probability decreases with energy. This seems contradictory until one remembers that a complete probability distribution is determined by the total multiplicity of the system and its surroundings, requiring the product of these two functions. We present evidence from individual and group interviews that students knew how each of these functions relates to multiplicity but did not recognize the need to combine the two to characterize the physical scenario.

Critical thinking and reasoning ability in the learning of science and math are stressed in A Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC, 2011) and the proposed NGSS, and are important in high performing countries in PISA and TIMMS studies. The School Year Based Inquiry Learning (SYBIL) professional development program for K-8 teachers increased teacher scientific content knowledge as well as inquiry-based teaching practices to develop higher order thinking and reasoning abilities in their students. Teachers were pre/post tested for gains in understanding of research-based misconceptions in content areas, while scientific reasoning tests (Lawson, 2000) were given at the beginning and end of the school year to both teachers and students (using modified versions for 2-5). In addition a Q-sort inquiry questionnaire measured classroom changes in teacher/student-centric approaches. Teachers made large gains in content, reasoning and teaching approach compared with a control group, and student reasoning gains tracked teacher reasoning.

The Colorado Learning Assistant (LA) model transforms large-enrollment undergraduate courses using talented undergraduate STEM majors to facilitate small-group interaction among enrolled students. The Colorado LA model has proven to be effective in increasing learning gains in LA-supported transformed courses and LAs themselves have been shown to outperform their peers in upper division courses. The LA model has also proven to be successful in recruiting talented physics majors to teaching careers and positively impacting their K-12 instruction. In this study we evaluate the impact of the LA model on the percentage of students who receive a final grade of D, final grade of F, or withdraw (DFW) from introductory physics courses at the University of Colorado-Boulder. Results will be reported and discussed.

Informal education programs organized by university physics departments are a popular means of reaching out to communities and satisfying grant requirements. The outcomes of these programs are often described in terms of broader impact on the community. Little attention, however, has been paid to the influence of such programs on the informal science facilitators themselves.  Through Partnerships for Informal Science Education in the Community (PISEC) at the University of Colorado Boulder, undergraduate and graduate physics students coach elementary and middle school children during an inquiry-based science afterschool program. As part of their participation in PISEC, university students complete preparation in pedagogy, communication and diversity, engage with children on a weekly basis and provide regular feedback about the program. We present findings that indicate these experiences improve the ability of university students to communicate in everyday language and influence their perspectives on teaching and learning.

Introductory calculus-based physics classes at the University of Colorado Boulder were significantly transformed beginning in 2004. They now regularly include: interactive engagement using clickers in large lecture settings; Tutorials in Introductory Physics with use of undergraduate Learning Assistants in recitation sections; and a staffed helproom setting where students work on personalized CAPA homework.  We compile and summarize conceptual (FMCE and BEMA) pre- and post-data from over 10,000 students after 16 semesters of both Physics 1 and 2.  Within a single institution with stable pre-test scores, we reproduce results of Hakes 1998 study that demonstrate the positive impacts of interactive engagement on student performance.  We present correlations between student demographics and student performance. We also investigate the impact of the degree of facultys use of interactive engagement techniques and their experience level on student outcomes. We argue for the role of such systematic data collection in sustained course and institutional transformations.

Video games can be very powerful teaching systems, and game designers have become adept at optimizing player engagement while scaffolding development of complex skills and situated knowledge. One implication is that we might create games to teach physics. Another, which we explore here, is that we might learn to improve classroom physics instruction by studying effective games. James Gee, in his book "What video games have to teach us about learning and literacy" (2007), articulates 36 principles that make good video games highly effective as learning environments. In this theoretical work, we identify 16 themes running through Gee's principles, and explore how these themes and Gee's principles could be applied to the design of an on-campus physics course. We find that the process pushes us to confront aspects of learning that physics instructors and even physics education researchers generally neglect, and we suggest some novel ideas for course design.

Education researchers have developed many new methods and innovations for teaching college-level STEM courses. Although these methods can document significantly improved student learning, they often do not spread beyond the developers. The Increasing the Impact project will examine successfully propagated projects and identify strategies they used to promote adaptation of their ideas at other institutions. The goal is to help future innovators incorporate propagation strategies into their projects at the earliest stages, matching the type of innovation with a specific plan to promote adoption of their work by others. We have begun this project by identifying the initial ideas about successful propagation held two important groups of stakeholders.  This poster will describe preliminary results of a web survey of NSF-funded principal investigators and NSF program directors in one education-related program.

Characterizing faculty expectations is important to produce a comprehensive understanding of what knowledge and skills students should acquire before and during a quantum mechanics course (QMC). We describe interviews conducted with faculty members in the Physics & Astronomy Department of Georgia State University.  These interviews probe faculty members expectations of senior undergraduate students background in mathematics, physics, and quantum mechanics concepts before entering a QMC. The interviews we conducted may provide students with a map" for areas that will help strengthen the knowledge and skills obtained in their QMC. We will report on faculty members views on optimal preparation for an undergraduate student entering a QMC and appropriate learning goals for a student completing a QMC.

Classroom participation has been shown to improve learning gains. However, instructors may at times find it difficult to engage their classrooms in effective discourse. Understanding how instructors effectively engage their students is key to facilitating student participation. Through qualitative video analysis of a Modeling Instruction Introductory Physics I class, we present an analysis of the impact of Instructor prompts on student participation. Using microanalysis of a video segment in which an instructor is engaging students in a series of questions during a large group white board meeting, we identified prompting mechanisms that contribute to student participation in a reformed classroom.

In light of recommendations from the literature for modeling expert-like problem solving approaches, we investigated how instructors use example solutions in teaching introductory physics. Twenty-four graduate teaching assistants and thirty physics faculty were asked to discuss their preferences for different solution features they observed in three example solutions provided. Data analysis focused on understanding instructors considerations when using example solutions and how these considerations were manifested through the solution features they valued and used. We found that while TAs consider helping students develop expert-like problem solving approaches when choosing example solution for their students, they do not notice many features described in the literature as supportive of this goal, and use even fewer of these features. Differences between the faculty and TAs will be discussed in order to describe possible progression of ideas throughout an instructors professional career.

In light of recommendations from the literature for modeling expert-like problem solving approaches, we investigated instructors' goals for providing example solutions in introductory physics courses. Twenty-four graduate teaching assistants and thirty faculty were asked: 1) in a general context, to describe their main purposes for providing example solutions, and 2) specifically, to identify their considerations when comparing three example solutions that reflect different pedagogical views. Differences between the faculty and TAs will be discussed in order to describe possible progression of ideas throughout an instructors professional career. For example, faculty explicitly emphasize the importance of developing expert-like problem solving when discussing their goals in the general context. In contrast TAs refer to the goal of developing expert-like problem solving mainly in an implicit manner, when examining specific solutions, and emphasize other values, such as helping students develop conceptual understanding, when asked explicitly on their purposes in the general context.

Numerical computation (the use of a computer to solve, simulate, or visualize a physical problem) has fundamentally changed the way scientific research is done.  By learning to use numerical computation, students acquire a familiarity with the tools of modern scientists and engineers.  As a complement to laboratory-constructed observations, numerical computation allows students to further explore their real-world by creating computational models of physical phenomenon.  These computational models can highlight the relationship between the different physics models presented in the Modeling Instruction program (no forces, balanced forces, unbalanced forces, et cetera).  We have just completed our second year teaching 9th grade students to use the VPython programming environment in a classroom that uses the Modeling Instruction curriculum. We will describe the various successes and challenges as well as the future direction of this initiative.

This is a report on a project to introduce interactive learning strategies to physics classes at Universit� Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris), one of the leading science universities in France.  In Spring 2012, instructors in over 20 classrooms, enrolling almost 1000 students, implemented Think-Pair-Share questions and Peer Instruction in the main lecture classrooms, and University of Washington Tutorials for Introductory Physics in recitation sections.  In two of these classes, a second semester mechanics class, and an introductory E&M class, enrolling 500 and 300 students respectively, pre- and post-instruction assessments (FCI and CSEM respectively) were given, along with a series of demographics questions.  Not all lecture or recitation sections in these classes used interactive learning, allowing us to compare the results of the FCI and CSEM between interactive and non-interactive classes taught simultaneously with the same curriculum.  We also analyze test results and course grades, as well as the results of student and instructor attitude surveys between classes.

Physics Studio teaching was recently introduced at an international and multicultural academic program of a U.S. university in Panama.  The results of introducing and implementing studio-style teaching on the conceptual understanding of calculus-based introductory physics have been measured by comparing before and during studio implementation. The research was carried over the last five years in different semesters. The measurement tool was the Force Concept Inventory.  The initial learning stage of the incoming diverse students has been found to be at a significantly lower level than the generally reported in the U.S. The normalized gain in conceptual understanding was significantly larger than in the former traditional system, and has become consistent in the last semesters. Multicultural aspects that may affect the entry level and performance enhancement are discussed.

Many physics instructors provide equations sheets to their students in physics tests.  In the context of this study, we allowed students to create and use their own equation sheets in various physics tests in a semester.  They were informed regarding the content and page limit of their equations sheets and were required to submit their equations sheets after the completion of their tests. We analyzed the information on the sheets over various tests during the entire semester.  In this presentation we report an investigation of the nature of student-created equations sheets.  In particular, we compared the nature of instructor prepared equations sheets with those prepared by the students. We also conducted a study to understand if and how students equations sheets progress over time. In addition, we investigated whether individual performance and problem-solving strategies could be predicted by the information and nature of the equations sheets.

Improving non-cognitive outcomes such as attitudes, efficacy, and persistence in physics courses is an important goal in physics education. This investigation implemented an in-the-moment surveying technique called the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) [1] to measure students' affective experience in physics.

Data are presented showing contrasts in students' experiences, (e.g., in physics vs. non-physics courses).

Student-centered instruction can lead to strong gains in physics learning.  However, even after targeted instruction, many students still struggle to systematically analyze unfamiliar situations.  We have identified sequences of questions that allow for an examination of inconsistencies in student reasoning approaches.  On these questions, many students demonstrate that they possess abilities to do the type of reasoning required for the problem, yet they fail to apply this reasoning to arrive at a correct answer.  In certain contexts, students tend to abandon the appropriate formal reasoning in favor of reasoning that was (perhaps) more intuitively appealing at that moment.  In other cases, erroneous student reasoning approaches can be attributed to the (relative) salience of specific features of the problem.  Results from introductory physics courses, in which Tutorials in Introductory Physics  were implemented as interactive lectures, will be presented. Implications for research and instruction will be discussed.

In teaching electrostatics and electric circuits, it is necessary to introduce abstract ideas such as electric fields and electric potential before discussions of circuits can take place.  We have found that students in introductory courses can build a functional understanding of some aspects of electric fields and potential, but their understanding of these concepts appears to falter when applied to systems involving conductors.  Some specific examples will be discussed, as well as a first attempt at modifying curriculum to address these difficulties.

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) is an extremely useful computational tool widely used for solving various physics problems. It is implicitly invoked in the evaluation of integral problems. Studies in mathematics education research have documented student difficulties with the underlying concepts of the FTC. We are investigating student difficulties with the FTC, and extending the work in mathematics to include situations relevant in physics. Questions administered as written surveys and individual interviews in calculus-based introductory physics and multivariable calculus classes focused on the determination of signs of integrals, primarily in graphical representations. Negative integrals in particular provided a rich context for the FTC application. We find that students use the FTC as a computational tool without understanding the underlying concepts. One observed difficulty is an operational confusion between the function endpoints and the antiderivative endpoints when determine the integral signs.

We present results highlighting students understanding of the magnetic force on a charged particle and associated difficulties in solving problems, using test and quiz responses from students enrolled in a studio-mode algebra-based second semester introductory physics course. Even when provided all the necessary formulas on exams and quizzes, students face difficulties in solving problems. While some students cannot recognize the correct formula with which to begin, others start correctly but lack the conceptual understanding to correctly apply the given information to the chosen formula. Additionally, some students lack necessary math skills to process their results and solve for the unknown quantity. Our discussion focuses on students understanding of coordinate system, use of the Right-Hand-Rule to determine the direction of the magnetic force, and use of vector math to determine the magnitude and direction of the net force. We also compare students abilities to solve condensed problems compared to directed problems.

Developing competency in problem solving and enhancing conceptual understanding are primary objectives in introductory physics, and many techniques and tools are available to help instructors achieve them. Pedagogically, we use an easy-to-implement intervention, the ACCESS protocol, to develop and assess problem-solving skills in our SCALE-UP classroom environment for algebra-based physics. Based on our research and teaching experience, an important question has emerged: while primarily targeting improvements in problem-solving and cognitive development, is it necessary that conceptual understanding be compromised? To address this question, we gathered and analyzed information about student abilities, backgrounds, and instructional preferences.  We report on our progress and give insights into matching the instructional tools to student profiles in order to achieve optimal learning in group-based active learning. The ultimate goal of our work is to integrate individual student learning needs into a pedagogy that moves students closer to expert-like status in problem solving.

We also argue that these assessments and negotiations are responsible, in part, for stabilizing the discussion around scientific inquiry.

Science is an integral part of our everyday lives and it is important that we continue to study it.  To ensure this, we need to get kids interested in science at a young age so that they hopefully choose it as a future career path.  In an effort to promote science, we presented an event at an elementary school with 104 first graders.  The event was two hours long and contained 13 different interactive demos and short physics activities.  A pair of a future elementary school teacher and physics major led each station.  After the event, the students were asked to draw an image of the event and write about their experiences using six sentences.  In order to discover the impact of this event on these students, we studied each journal entry, analyzed the context of students sentences, and looked at the frequency that each concept was mentioned.  This poster will present our findings and show in which ways this event impacted kids interest, knowledge and attitude about science.

Cooperative group development has been a topic of interest for many years and has been the background for a number of research-based pedagogical strategies.  Grouping students and assigning individual roles has been shown to increase confidence, teamwork and content understanding, especially among groups traditionally underrepresented in physics.  In this study, we are taking a microscopic look at group dynamics, focusing on student roles as followers and leaders.  Student expectations, ability and views of each roll are being compared to conceptual change and epistemological change throughout each semester of a two-semester calculus-based introductory physics course.  Initial results show a strong correlation between leadership development and epistemological change especially in the areas of the nature of knowing and learning and applicability to real-life.  The initial results of the research will be presented along with the long-term direction of the project.

Students who meet the prerequisite requirement of an introductory physics course are expected to be well-prepared. However, students enrolled in physics courses often demonstrate mathematical deficiency in problem solving. Many teachers believe that taking mathematics courses will solve the issue. In a recent study at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Eastern Kentucky University, a mathematics diagnostic test (pre- and post-) is given to students enrolled in a physics course and those who enrolled in an algebra course. The results suggest that when students take physics, their mathematical skills improve significantly, even more so than they do in a traditional mathematics course.

Many nonscientists (as well as a very few real scientists) do not think that climate change could be caused by human actions. Reasons range from doubt that tiny humans could affect an entire planet to belief that human life on Earth will soon end. Science is about experimental data, reasoning from those data, and theoretical perspectives supported by the data. Svante Arrhenius provided (in 1896) the first theoretical (and compelling) reasons that carbon dioxide could influence Earths energy budget. Multiple sources of modern data underlie the belief of virtually all climate scientists that humans are changing the climate. The evidence is based on temperature measurements, satellite observations, ice-core sampling, statistical analyses, sea level measurements, observations of plant and animal behavior, and other sorts of measurements. This leads to the question of how best to inform students and fellow citizens about how to respond to these data.

During the 2011-2012 academic year, West Virginia University began a learning assistants (LA) program in its introductory calculus-based physics course targeted at increasing course effectiveness and recruiting future STEM teachers. The LA program was modeled after the Colorado Learning Assistant model. This poster describes the setting and initial results from the implementation including changes in learning gains (measured with the FMCE) and attitudes (measured with the CLASS). These data are combined with demographic data about the individual students and compared to baseline data collected during the spring semester of 2011. Particular attention is paid to whether the changes in the modified course have affected under-represented populations in physics any differently from the overall effect in the course.

In winter and spring term, 2011, a series of surveys were given in introductory calculus-based physics at Oregon State University to determine areas of the mechanics curriculum that are markedly low in terms of student motivation, and to understand the basis of the low motivation.  Using motivation and project-based learning literature, a series of activities with the context of carbon nanotubes were implemented during spring term 2012 in the activity-based portion of this course.  This poster will address the survey process, our findings on student motivation for the mechanics curriculum, and the activities we developed.  This project encompassed a range from quantitative to qualitative data and curriculum development and implementation with a team of instructors. The poster will also address the process of condensing a large project into something manageable for an undergraduate student thesis, including shadowing the survey validation process, learning non-parametric statistics, and learning qualitative data analysis techniques.

The project started with a problem that continued to occur in a 300 level astrophysics course. Although students did well on quantitative problems year after year, their performance on individual conceptual quizzes was lacking.  We hypothesized that the reason for student difficulties is the mismatch between the context of learning and assessment. The mismatch occurred as students encountered conceptual questions as a part of their group work in class but the quiz required individual work. To test our hypothesis we added conceptual questions to the student's homework problem sets to match the individual aspect of student learning and the conceptual focus. We also made sure that added questions are based on cognitive studies and PER findings. The result of the testing experiment was an improvement of student performance on the conceptual quiz with the effect size greater than one. We will discuss the limitations and implications of the study.

This research study involved high school physics students and studied how they learn to understand Newtons laws as they relate to falling bodies and projectile motion.  Students in introductory, algebra-based, high school physics classes were evaluated based on their prior knowledge of the subject and given a pretest to assess their initial comprehension of the motion of falling bodies and projectiles.  Groups were divided and taught separately with an emphasis on either mathematical derivation and application of equations, followed by brief conceptual discussions, or on thorough conceptual analysis, followed by a brief mathematical verification. After a posttest was given, an evaluation of the responses and explanations of each group of students was used to determine which method of instruction yielded greater learning gains among the two groups.  Results indicate that both methods achieved similar normalized gains in comprehension, but that in most areas, students in the conceptual group achieved slightly higher posttest scores.

In a recent study at Louisiana State University, introductory physics students improved retention, conceptual understanding and problem solving abilities when one of three weekly lectures were replaced with group problem solving sessions facilitated with pen-input computers (Tablet PCs) and interaction software (DyKnow).
The research goal of the present study was to isolate the effect of the methodology itself from that of the involved technology. In Fall of 2011 we compared the performance of students taking the same introductory physics lecture course while enrolled in two separate problem-solving sections. One section used pen-based computing to facilitate group problem solving while the other section used low-tech venues such as whiteboards. Sections then traded technologies they used.  While a variety of informative usage patterns were observed with both user groups, analysis indicates no significant difference in scores of the two groups.

Many instructors want their students to learn for deeper understanding. When students enter our college physics class they most likely associate school learning with rote memorization and have lost a sense of what it means to learn for understanding. Research shows that a two-pronged approach is needed for students to take a deep approach to learning: 1) The learning environment has to support deep understanding, and 2) attention must be paid to change students conceptions of learning and motivate them to take the plunge. In designing our introductory physics course we focused on a) aligning all course elements to promote deep learning, b) implementing specific activities to help students access productive deep learning resources that they dont normally associate with school learning, and c) motivating students to take the difficult path to deep understanding. Through interviews we found that students view the class as both challenging and enjoyable.

We explore the relationship between students' motivation for learning and their performance in introductory physics.  On a survey given at the beginning of an introductory mechanics course, some students selected "learning and gaining knowledge" from a list of possible values as one of their primary values, and then explained why this was important to them.  Their explanations reveal that some of the students possess an instrinsic motivation for learning, while others have an extrinsic motivation, valuing learning because it leads to other things.  Students whose motivation for learning is intrinsic scored higher on tests and earned higher grades than those whose motivation is extrinsic.

Despite the fact that a physics course typically culminates in one final grade for the student, many instructors and researchers believe that there are several different skills that students need to acquire to achieve mastery. Reasonably large data sets, from online assignments in blended courses or from widely administered standard instruments, lend themselves to analysis using a statistical learning algorithm called Collaborative Filtering (CF), which can be applied to discover the "dimensionality" of the skills involved and the clustering of assessment items by their ability to discriminate between students who have more or less of these skills.  CF in this context is related to factor analysis and item response theory (IRT), as we show, but it comes at the problem from a machine learning perspective, seeking to maximize the accuracy in predicting which students will answer which items correctly. We describe the operation of a CF and demonstrate its application to student response data in coursework and on standard instruments.

Various nanotechnology activities were introduced to thirdfourth grade pupils. Providing idea of 'a material can act differently when it's nanometer-sized', two inquiry activities concerning surface areas were conducted. Wonderful memory wire activity were designed for attracting pupils' interests in investigating how Nitinol (an special alloy) works, in terms of atomic structures, physical properties, and its applications. More fun with huge bubbles activity was integrated into nanoscience classroom. Finally, nano surface property is focused. The pupils were asked to compare the similarity and differentiation between hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface of several kinds of materials. Learning nanotechnology through this set of activity, most of students revealed that they enjoyed with all curious materials that teachers let them played and also had fun with designing/making their own toys from those nano-materials.

When creating graphical representations in physics, spatial dimensions on the writing surface are used to stand for physical quantities. Sometimes these quantities are literally spatial (the position of a particle), and sometimes they are more abstract (e.g., velocity, time, electric field, complex amplitude of an energy eigenstate). When one spatial dimension is used to represent more than one physical quantity, the multiple-occupancy problem is created: How do thinkers stay organized, keeping two (or more) separate meanings for one spatial dimension in ways that these meanings can be used productively? We introduce the idea of nested coordinates as a common solution to this problem. We analyze some familiar diagrams using this framework and provide a theoretical account of why certain diagrams cause confusion for students. We also provide an example of how nested coordinates can be used to create a graphic for spin-1/2 systems.

Asking students about the acceleration of a tossed object is a well-studied problem in physics education research. Students frequently respond using reasoning that describes the velocity of the ball, in particular that acceleration is zero at the top. We created new versions of the canonical multiple-choice Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation ball-toss questions to investigate what other reasoning students might use. Some students were asked "is the acceleration zero at the top?" These students were half as likely to give a velocity-like response (that a=0) as were students answering the canonical form. Other students were told "the acceleration is not zero" and asked to explain. Roughly 75% of these students could explain why acceleration is not zero. This is in contrast to the 60% who say it is zero at the top. We discuss implications for instruction based on these data.

This paper reports reflections on John Deweys pragmatic philosophy and its potential implications on deliberations regarding research design. The literature provides evidence that new research-based teaching resources have had positive effects on students conceptual development. However, studies of students experience of the very process of collaborative learning motivated by those resources are lacking. One constraint to study that phenomenon is its complexity. That makes it resistant to evidence-based rhetoric. Grounded on writings of Dewey and of some of his analysts, we have explored his pragmatic intellectual space and contrasted it with the rationalistic, the empiricist, and the militant intellectual spaces where often a person in PER would move. We did it by analyzing important events of PER history. We came to a conclusion which can be a stimulus for creative deliberations regarding research design of collaborative knowledge building in classroom: a set of constraints  with which research should comply.

Flipped classrooms, as best advocated by Sal Khan and Bill Gates, are attracting an increasing amount of media and research attention because of how they reshape learning boundaries. Flipped classrooms invert the conventional instruction-script: information transfer is done at home instead of in class and 'homework' problems and in-depth activities are done in class. Instead of 'transferring information' in class, instructors use their expertise to help students make meaning of the content and make connections between new and prior knowledge.

We report on a first implementation of a flipped classroom by two experienced college instructors that devote part of their time to science education research. Yet, both struggled with the shift in instructional roles and boundaries. Beyond the learning gains and student engagement in class, both instructors felt that something else had flipped throughout the process: their own understanding of teaching&

Object-oriented development depends upon the creation of generic pieces that can be built into more complex parts.  The process of teaching of physics concepts often parallels that of object-oriented design.  Capitalizing on that parallel, the techniques of object-oriented software engineering are applied to the development of physics learning modules.  Each learning object consists of observable quantities, such as the physical properties of an item and operators that act on it, such as force.   Additionally, each object can include an assessment operator that evaluates the impact of the learning object on student comprehension.

The physics object-oriented learning kits (POOLkits) will be developed to enhance student understanding of physics concepts, as well as, build a framework for developing a software object based on the physics concept.   As with software objects, POOLkits can be extended as physics knowledge expands.  POOLkits may also enhance the object-oriented programming capabilities of physics students.

Although nearly 50% of high school physics students are female, only 21% of physics bachelors degrees are earned by females.  Using data from the Sustainability and Gender in Engineering (SaGE) Project, a national survey of college students in introductory English courses, we examine the influence of students physics and math identities on their choice to pursue a physics career. Males have higher math and physics identities than females in all three dimensions of our identity framework. These dimensions include: performance/competence (perceptions of ability to perform/understand), recognition (perception of recognition by others), and interest (desire to learn more).  A regression model predicting students intentions to pursue physics careers shows, as expected, that males are significantly more likely to choose physics than females. Surprisingly, however, when physics and math identity are included in the model, females are shown to be equally or slightly more likely to choose physics careers compared to males.

Classroom interactions provide learning opportunities including understanding others and developing agency in a community of learners.  Using a survey instrument measuring physics learning identity, an academically successful and confident student in an introductory physics course was selected to examine identity development and better understand how students become science learners in an active engagement classroom during Fall 2009, at Oregon State University. Findings indicate he didnt develop a sense of agency, nor did he feel a need to alter his participation, although there were ample opportunities to do so in the learning community. These results suggest that being a successful physics student in the traditional sense doesnt necessarily mean the student is successful at adopting meta-goals.  This student was prompted to engage meaningfully, but simply didnt feel it was required for success, suggesting structural alignment is required to motivate students to achieve meta-goals such as a stronger sense of physics learning.

At Florida International University we are developing a Curriculum Guide and set of comprehensive video and digital resources to support the implementation of Modeling Instruction. In preparation for dissemination of the curriculum materials and instructor support guide, we pilot tested the curriculum guide. An instructor with no previous experience teaching introductory physics using Modeling Instruction utilized the curriculum guide and instructor resources. To better understand how to support Modeling Instruction curriculum use, we conducted interviews with the instructor during and after the semester. We have identified three types of instructional resources germane to implementing Modeling Instruction. The instructor brought considerable resources based on prior teaching experiences. Several resources were developed during the instruction with assistance of the curriculum materials. Finally, several resources were not developed. We investigate the role that these resources play in instruction and how to structure faculty professional development that supports the development of instructional resources.

Nanotechnology research is highly interdisciplinary in nature. This necessitates physics graduate researchers working in this area to constantly interact with colleagues, mentors and research collaborators from other scientific disciplines. 

The present work deals with examining physics postgraduate researchers lived experiences of researching in nanotechnology area to realize how early researchers understand, perceive and interpret nanotechnology research; and connect their education and training to work in this area. Examining researchers lived experiences can also identify the attributes, knowledge, skill and competence necessary to work in this interdisciplinary area and thereby address if the enhancement of existing physics curricula with an interdisciplinary perspectives is necessary.

In this ongoing study, we have interviewed ten physics postgraduate researchers and collected the rich descriptions of their lived experiences. The transcripts were analysed using thematic coding and hermeneutic phenomenological analysis. We present how phenomenological methodology was successful in data collection and analysis and guided future studies.

There is ongoing discussion of the extent to which specific strands of teacher professional development influence student learning.  We describe research efforts exploring the roles of teacher content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge, particularly teacher knowledge of student ideas (KSI), in the context of the Maine Physical Sciences Partnership (MainePSP).  The primary focus of the MainePSP is the professional development of physical science instructors in grades 6-9 via curriculum renewal using common instructional resources across multiple school districts.  This particular study looks to assess teacher content knowledge and KSI in order to explore their respective effects on student learning in specific contexts, including density and mechanics.  We will describe our methods, present preliminary results, and outline recommendations for further investigation.

Research has shown that students have several misconceptions about rotational motion and rolling (Rimoldini & Singh, 2005).  Students do not understand the relationship between the speeds of various points on a rolling wheel. They also do not understand the relationship between the translational and rotational speeds of a wheel that rolls without slipping.  We conducted a study to further extend the research by Rimoldini and Singh (2005).  Specifically, we explored students difficulties with regard to rolling without slipping in three different contexts: a single rolling bicycle wheel, two differently sized wheels in a penny-farthing bicycle, and a horizontal plank pushed forward on a rolling drum.  In each case, students in two different introductory physics classes responded in writing to open-ended questions asking them to compare the speeds at various points of the wheels in the three contexts.  We will describe students conceptions about rolling in these different contexts.

Blooms taxonomy of cognitive levels has been used extensively by Biology Education researchers to empirically measure the degree to which course assessments support the development of higher-order cognitive skills.  However, this method is not commonly used in physics. In the present study, in collaboration with an interdisciplinary team of STEM education researchers, we built on this work to explore the utility of Blooms taxonomy within the context of introductory physics.  Specifically, we probed (1) the degree to which exams assess higher-order thinking skills and (2) the relationship between cognitive level and the item difficulty.  Initial correlation analysis reveals that item difficulty, as determined by student exam performance, is not easily explained by variation in cognitive level.  Results relevant to student learning in introductory physics courses will be presented.

The Partnerships for Informal Science Education in the Community (PISEC) program at the University of Colorado Boulder brings together university and community institutions to create a space where K-12 students join with University educators to engage in inquiry-based scientific practices after school. These afterschool activities were originally developed to reinforce the traditional learning goals of the classroom, including mastering scientific content, skills and processes. Recently, the primary focus of the PISEC curriculum has been shifted towards the development of students scientific identity, an explicit objective of informal learning environments. The new curriculum offers students more activity choices, affords space for scientific drawings and descriptions and provides incentive for students to design their own experiments. We have analyzed student science notebooks from both old and new curricula and find that with the redesigned curriculum, students exhibit increased agency and more instances of scientific communication while still demonstrating substantial content learning gains.

When teachers look for good practices in the classroom, they usually consider strategies for teaching individual topics. However, in order to attain mastery, students also need to fit together topics to create a broader landscape of learning.  To aid physics students in this, the concept of quest is proposed, wherein students link materials learned in previous sections toward a goal of understanding the following subject matter. Quest encourages students to press forward in their inquiry, as opposed to just ticking off another topic on the syllabus. As a goal-driven endeavor, the quest may be useful in creating a sense of excitement in the students. Do teachers use the unifying technique of quest, even informally? In this presentation, based on surveys of high school teachers, strategies teachers use in the classroom is explored as well as receptiveness to using the educational technique of quest. Multicultural attitudes will also be delved into.

Some instructors give prompts that encourage students to articulate their beliefs and conceptions, as well as encourage students to understand the thoughts of their peers.  This reflective discourse is used in a classroom at Lane Community College, where the instructor explicitly has discourse goals in his course structure. We investigated whether students mimic this discourse when solving problems outside of the classroom context.  In order to examine this, we interviewed groups of students in this calculus-based introductory physics class, after the end of spring term 2012. The students were asked to solve open-ended problems using a think aloud protocol in small groups, with analysis of their discourse focused on whether students applied the reflective discourse practiced during the course. Students were then asked a series of follow-up questions to reflect upon their experiences in the course. This paper will address the findings of this study.

In this poster we present the results of a regression analysis exploring high school teacher impacts on student Force Concept Inventory (FCI) scores. The data was collected from 1,344 students of 18 high school physics teachers. In this analysis we utilized the teacher, FCI Pre Score, Gender, and Ethnic Representation as the independent variables and FCI Post Score as the dependent variable. The regression analysis returned an effect size of .37 (Cohens f2) and indicated that 12 out of 18 high school physics teachers had a significant impact in accounting for the variance within student FCI Post Scores. Further analysis showed that of the 12 teachers accounting for a significant amount of the variance, only five had a positive beta coefficient.  This indicates that there are dynamic differences between teachers that may be revealed through other measures such as the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP).

A typical approach to introducing the work-energy theorem begins with a definition of work, a definition of kinetic energy, and presents a mathematical proof of the relationship between the two. In the Energy Project, a professional development effort, teachers constructed a set of laws relating energy changes with forces.  At first glance their laws bear little resemblance to the work-energy theorem.  However, these laws are not only consistent with the work-energy theorem, but they present the theorem in a way that is deeply causal. In this paper, I discuss how the representational system of Energy Theater facilitated the development of causal laws, drawing on Sherins (1995) work on how symbol systems affect students conceptualization of physics, in which he concluded algebra-physics can be characterized as a physics of balance and equilibrium, and programming-physics a physics of processes and causation (p. 421).

We analyze coherence-seeking in on-going student activity from a video-recorded discussion section.  Here, students engage in a task designed to build connections between physics and biology.  We present evidence of students 1) spontaneously bringing in unanticipated outside knowledge into their reasoning in this physics course and 2) seeking connections between the course material and other things they know.  Throughout this process, we examine both implicit and explicit indexing of the disciplines throughout the reasoning episode to show that often these connections span disciplinary boundaries.  Independent of whether reconciliation is achieved, we see coherence-seeking as essential to scientific practice and as such we claim that coherence-seeking should be a focus of our assessment efforts.

We also describe outcomes from preliminary implementations of our transformed curriculum, offer insights into topic-specific student difficulties, and outline plans for the dissemination and further refinement of these materials.

Inspired by the TYC New Faculty Experience, I implemented a DC circuit activity into my algebra/trig-based introductory physics class and lab.  The classroom activity used bulbs and batteries to let students (a) discover how current flows through a circuit by using evidence (bulb brightness) to distinguish the difference in current through series or parallel circuits, and (b) learn to measure voltage and compare voltage drops across bulbs in various arrangements.  A new series and parallel lab addressed students preconceptions and filled a need for an introductory lab to supplement a combination circuit lab.  

This poster will identify students preconceptions revealed during the new DC circuit lab and classroom activity, compare these preconceptions to the literature, and discuss the results on students conceptual understanding of DC circuits.  It will also address the value of learning about your students thinking which becomes visible during active engagement learning.

The ability to distinguish experts from novices by any instrument is highly sensitive to the questions being posed.  But what features must a set of questions have to do a good job of distinguishing experts from novices?  To answer this question, we re-examine the seminal study by Chi et al., which firmly established the notion that novices categorize physics problems by "surface features" (e.g. "incline," "pendulum," "projectile motion," ...), while experts use "deep structure" (e.g., "energy conservation," "Newton 2," ...). We studied the categorizations of known physics experts and novices using a set of 50 introductory physics problems.  A novel statistical approach allowed us to compare any two categorizations on the basis of problem identity alone.  Then, by applying this method repeatedly to small subsets of our original 50 problem set we determined how accurately we could classify experts and novices based on the pedagogical and contextual features of the questions being posed.  We found that the number of questions required to accurately classify experts and novices could be surprisingly small so long as particular pedagogical and contextual features were present.

The existence of a gender disparity in both participation and performance in undergraduate physics is often referred to as a gender gap. This study investigates the role of assessment type on this gender discrepancy in student learning. Data collected at the University of Edinburgh will be presented illustrating the gender performance profiles in course assessments and end-of-course examinations. 

Results from first year introductory physics courses show that female students are consistently outperforming male students in coursework assessment between 2006 and 2011, suggesting a slight inclination of females towards continually assessed elements of the course. Trends in examination results show a less distinct pattern. This study has been extended to investigate the extent to which this gender difference in performance persists as students progress through their undergraduate degree programme

Research has shown that students have several misconceptions about pulleys. Students must elicit and confront these misconceptions in order to construct a mental model of how pulley systems work.  We report on a study with students in a conceptual physics laboratory using either physical or virtual manipulatives to investigate forces in pulley systems.  Written materials guided students through a sequence of activities designed to scaffold their model construction process.  The activity sequences facilitated students sense making by requiring them to make and test predictions about various pulley systems by building and comparing different systems.  We investigate the ways in which students discuss force while navigating the scaffolding activities and how the students mental model development of pulley systems compares between the physical and virtual treatments.

The CSU Noyce Scholar Program expanded the internship component of its program to enable Noyce Scholars to engage in summer and school-year internships. Internships are available though Informal Science Institutions in Chicago, particularly Adler Planetarium, The Field Museum, and the Museum of Science and Industry, as well as with science education research faculty at CSU and the community ecological activist group Southeast Environmental Task Force.  The internship program for pre-service professional development of Noyce Scholars was created for the following reasons: (1) to mitigate the need of Scholars to have outside jobs which detract rather than contribute to their professional education, (2) to provide diverse experiences in science education and introduce students to the vast ISI resources available, and (3) to further encourage a sense of place to develop not just science teachers but Chicago science teachers who are attached to the challenges and affordances of science education in the city.   Two years of the internship program have highlighted successes and difficulties associated with the management of a multi-site internship program.

We surveyed 88 students at four colleges: one mens college, two womens colleges, and one coeducational college. The questions, modified from Reid (2007), asked about in-class participation, how fulfilled they were by their achievement in their calc-based physics class, their attitude toward their class, and their self-efficacy (Bandura 1994) in the class. While a t-test showed no difference between men and women, an ANOVA showed a significant interaction between sex and type of school. Detailed results will be presented and discussed.

We investigated student understanding of simple vector component problems. Students in a calculus-based introductory physics class were given a variety of vector component questions, with the angle placed in various orientations. For example, the angle could be given with respect to vertical/horizontal, or with respect to the tip/tail of the vector. Student solution methods, as well as relative frequencies of different errors, were found to depend on the configuration of the given angle. Overall results suggest that many students based their answers on the most commonly seen canonical angle configuration, while others used their own methods to maintain the validity of the canonical solution path. Possible training methods to correct for the misconceptions involved are discussed.

This past year at the University of Northern Colorado several research-based teaching practices were integrated into the two semester introductory physics course for science majors.  These included, but were not limited to, using many of the open-source Tutorials in Physics Sense-Making from the University of Maryland Physics Education Research Group.  This paper presents results on measures of conceptual understanding of equipotentials after students completed the Electrostatic Potentials Tutorial and Tutorial Homework. In addition CLASS data and results from an end of semester survey on students views of the impact of different course resources on their learning will be presented. Results show that student conceptual understanding was much improved over traditional instruction and instructor observation found increased engagement with Tutorials; however, most students do not value the Tutorials for their learning.

We investigate introductory physics students difficulties in translating between mathematical and graphical representations and effect of scaffolding on students performance. We gave a typical problem that can be solved using Gausss law to 96 calculus-based introductory physics students. Students were asked to write an expression for the electric field in various regions and graph it. We implemented two scaffolding interventions to help them: (1) students were asked to draw the electric field in each region first (before having to plot it at the end) or (2) asked to draw the electric field in each region and asked to evaluate the electric field at the beginning, mid and end points of each region. The comparison group was only asked to plot the electric field at the end of the problem. We also conducted interviews in order to better understand how the interventions impacted them. We will present some surprising results.

Students come to any physics course with expectations about the world, science, and learning. Those expectations have an influence on the way that students make observations, reason about phenomena, and draw conclusions. In certain situations, those expectations may be inconsistent with those of the physics community and lead to results that are inconsistent with the body of knowledge in physics. We designed a new group learning activity that was intended to support students in model-building and finding coherence between multiple representations in the context of an underdamped harmonic system. During this activity, students mostly relied on qualitative expectations about the systems velocity and an expected mathematical solution, both of which were inappropriate for this system. At the same time, they displayed expectations about coherence between symbolic, graphical, and qualitative representations that would typically be productive, but this was not enough in this situation for building the appropriate model.

Incorrect student understanding of the directional relationship between velocity and net force is a well known student difficulty. In addition, we have previously reported that students tend to respond with a different relationship between net force and velocity if they are given the net force and asked about the velocity vs. if they are given the velocity and asked about the net force. Here we report on student responses from a set of contextual situations with varying numbers of forces on an object. In these situations students are asked either about the forces on the object, including the possibility of a force of motion, or students are asked to give the direction of the net force. This comparison allows for a better understanding of the students perceptions of the similarities and differences between net force and force-of-motion. Results indicate that the difficulties students have with force of motion may not be the same as the difficulties that students have with net force and/or that the solution path taken in the two cases is different. Either way, the resources used by students for these net force questions and force of motion questions are different, and considering these differences allows for a better understanding of the nature of the well-known student confusion between net force and velocity.

At Florida International University weve been experimenting with a novel exam format. Weve been giving our introductory physics students a group exam followed by an individual exam that contains transfer questions related to the group exam. The group exam requires students to work together on a difficult new problem. This format reflects one of our primary learning goals for our students: to be able to learn physics on their own. Videos of the group exam reveal that students are highly collaborative and engage in productive learning activities; such as, sense-making and constructing new representations. The question addressed in this poster is: Is students participation in the group exam related to their ability to transfer their knowledge to the embedded questions? We present analysis that shows that students ability to transfer their knowledge is related to how much they participate and more subtly, how they participate in sensemaking and representational activities.

Modern middle school science curricula use group activities to help students express their thinking and enable them to work together like scientists. We are studying rural 8th grade science classrooms using materials on energy. Even after spending several months with the same curriculum on other physics topics, students' engagement in group activities seems to be restricted to creating lists of words that are associated with energy. Though research suggests that children have rich and potentially valuable ideas about energy, our students don't seem to spontaneously use and express their ideas in the classroom. Only within or after certain interactions with a teacher do students begin to explore and share these ideas. We present and characterize examples of student-teacher interactions resulting in students' deeper engagement with their ideas about energy. This preliminary analysis of video-recorded classroom dialog is a step toward helping teachers improve their students' learning about energy.

The provision of diagrammatic representations, which accompany the models to which students are introduced, is a common form of scaffolding used in our reformed, collaborative, interactive introductory physics course. Use of these representational tools encourages a systematic application of physical principles and provides guidance to help students formalize their problem solving approach. This paper is a case study report on three classroom examples showing how students who have been introduced to such a tool, work collaboratively and engage in sense-making dialogue to formulate responses to questions regarding specific phenomena using conservation of energy principles. Analysis of small-group discourse, whole class discussions and student blackboard illustrations deepens our understanding of the process students go through to make sense and meaning for themselves when using these diagrammatic representations as tools. Our analysis illustrates how these students, with adequate practice, use the diagrammatic representation to attain higher levels of integrated reasoning.

We report on the transformation of a single introductory undergraduate algebra-based laboratory on electric potentials from a lab of verification to a lab of discovery and inquiry.  Our basis for the transformation process was initially drawn from a Modeling Instruction activity, which is grounded in inquiry and research based practices.  We assess the impact of the transformation by providing students (N> 300) a short survey after they completed the transformed lab and an exam question related to the topic of the transformed lab.  From the survey, we found positive shifts in students affect regarding the topic of electric potentials.  However, preliminary results on the exam question did not show improvement when compared to the previous term.  In this paper, we discuss our results with respect to why we believe we observed positive affective, but not conceptual, shifts in the students and present some ideas for future iterations of this process.

Students' sometimes contradictory ideas about ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and the nature of chemical bonds have been studied in the biology and chemistry education literatures, but these topics are rarely part of the introductory physics curriculum.  We present qualitative data from an introductory physics course for undergraduate biology majors that seeks to build greater interdisciplinary coherence and therefore includes these topics.  In these data, students grapple with the apparent contradiction between the energy released when the phosphate bond in ATP is broken and the idea that an energy input is required to break a bond.  We see that students' perceptions of how each scientific discipline bounds the system of interest can influence how they justify their reasoning about a topic that crosses disciplines.  This has consequences for a vision of interdisciplinary education that respects disciplinary perspectives while bringing them into interaction in ways that demonstrate consistency amongst the perspectives.

We present case-study data of undergraduates describing the relationship between scientific disciplines.  Rather than viewing biology, chemistry, and physics as existing in disconnected silos, or as overlapping only in narrow regions of common interest, these students exhibit a range of nuanced views about disciplinary relationships.  Some students describe hierarchical arrangements that order the disciplines by degree of system complexity, or by the scale used to examine a particular system.   In other instances students want physics embedded in a context that positions its relationship to biology via analogy, or reference the way in which general physical principles like energy conservation or entropy maximization impose constraints on biological systems.  We examine evidence that students conceptions are unstable and context-dependent, and describe how such conceptions may inform future course messaging and task design.   We argue that these case studies illustrate the varied resources that students posses for seeking coherence across disciplines.

Density is an important, multifaceted concept that occurs at many levels of physics. Previous research has shown that a primary instantiation of the concept, mass density, is not well understood by students. Our research seeks to determine how students understand the broad concept of density, and whether particular aspects of their understanding are helpful in structuring the concept of charge density. Qualitative data were gathered from 172 freshmen. Broad, open ended questions prompted for responses involving free writing and drawn diagrams. Using the theoretical lens of Conceptual Metaphor Theory six underlying (foothold) concepts were identified in terms of which density was conceptualised: filled container; packing; weight/heaviness; intensive property; floating/sinking; impenetrability/solidity. The foothold concept of packing proved to be the most productive for conceptualising charge density. Responses involving drawing provided a better signal of a productive foothold concept, illustrating the prevalence of underlying metaphorical structure in creative or novel contexts.

Analysis of 14 different student groups working on three different recitation problems reveals that:

1. Despite significant prompting within the problems and support in lecture, over half of the groups do not make significant use of their real-world knowledge as a part of their solution to the recitation problems.

2.  Students that do make use of their real-world knowledge do so during conceptual discussion, but not during procedural discussion.

We interviewed experts and novices about their understanding of the physics of solar cells, and examined their responses for evidence of resources being activated. We used this information to create a unit discussing the physics of solar cells at the advanced undergraduate level, which we then implemented.  Based on the patterns in the interviews and student responses in the classroom during the unit we can hypothesize what ideas students draw on when they are trying to understand the complex physics involved in the functioning of solar cells.

The study explores the relationship between students mental representations and their handling of sequential multiple representations. A total of 19 engineering students, taking a calculus-based physics course, participated in three individual interview sessions. They completed one directed and five non-directed kinematics tasks. The Johnson-Laird (1983) cognitive framework was used to categorize the types of mental constructs. More than half of the sample (11 in 19, 58%) constructed a propositional mental representation. The remaining 42% (8 in 19) of the cohort generated a mental image. None of the students was classified as constructing a mental model. A trend was observed in how students with these two kinds of cognitive structures handle multiple external representations. Moreover, their actions when dealing with the non-directed tasks posed with different representational formats seem to transfer and hence influence their approach with the directed task containing sequential multiple representations.

In this article we investigate students difficulties interpreting the torque vector in a physical situation. To identify these difficulties we carried out task-based interviews with undergraduate physics major students completing a junior-level course of mechanics. In the task we presented a drawing with a beam that is initially at equilibrium over a fulcrum. Later, a weight is hung in a position on the left side. We detected an alternative conception in which students think that the left side of the beam and the weight will have an additional motion in the direction of the torque vector. To quantify students having this alternative conception, we designed and administered a multiple-choice question to undergraduate physics major students completing a sophomore-level modern physics course. We found that 18% of the students had this conception. From these results, we present some suggestions for instruction of the torque vector concept.

Teachers, researchers, and curriculum developers utilize the results of formative assessment to elicit students pre-instruction physics ideas. In canonical physics education research tasks, students are asked to identify a correct answer and justify their answer choice. However, we find that students often know more than is revealed by their answers to these question formats. In two research tasks,students were either given the correct answer and asked to justify it, or they were asked which response they would eliminate and to provide a justification for why that response is incorrect.  These tasks were randomly administered, online, to students in the first semester of an introductory calculus-based physics course.  We present results from these pretests, comparing the types of reasoning and frequency of responses across question types. We find that the variations in responses given by students are context dependent.

In this article we investigate students understanding of dot product as a projection. In the first part, we compare students performance in three isomorphic multiple-choice problems: no-context, work and electric flux. We administered one of the three problems to 422 students completing all introductory physics courses. In the second part, we analyze students ability to connect the physical concepts with the dot product formal representation. We carried out interviews with 14 students, in which they answered the three same isomorphic problems. In the test administration we found a difference that was statistically significant: both physical context problems help students select the projection interpretation option. However, the percentages of students that select this option remained very low in the three problems. Moreover, in the interviews we noticed that students have serious difficulties to develop a coherent conceptual framework between the physical concepts and the dot product formal representation.

Writing tasks are one way students can apply science concepts, yet evaluating students writing can be difficult in large classes. With the web-based Calibrated Peer Review* (CPR) system, students submit written work and evaluate each other. Students write a response to a prompt, read and evaluate responses prepared by the curriculum developers, and receive feedback on their evaluations, allowing students to calibrate their evaluation skills. Students then evaluate their peers work and their own work. We have used CPR for two semesters in conceptual physics courses with enrollments of ~100 students. By independently assessing students responses, we evaluated the CPR calibration process and compared students peer reviews with expert evaluations. We find little relationship between the CPR systems measure of students reviewing competency and our independent determination. Nevertheless, students scores on their essays correlate with our independent evaluations.  This poster describes these findings and our experiences with implementing CPR assignments.

There is debate in the science education literature about how best to improve students' understanding of the nature of science: Can an immersion experience in the process of doing science like scientists outperform explicit instruction on the nature of science? Central in resolving that debate is the development of appropriate measures of students understanding of the nature of science.  We report on a course in which students engaged in sophisticated scientific practices, and yet student responses to a standard nature of science survey showed surprisingly few pre-post changes. We argue that this data suggests that when students do science like scientists do, they gain a grasp of scientific practice that cannot be measured by declarative means such as surveys and interviews.

Peer instruction, a teaching strategy designed to increase student interaction, has been shown to improve student learning and retention in physics courses. In the classroom, students respond to conceptual questions, discuss with peers and then respond again. Student response patterns (or switching) provide the instructor with real-time feedback of student understanding and are used to guide the discussion during class.  But how do these switching patterns relate to other dimensions of student learning? Does switching tell us more about students' confidence than understanding? How can we better understand this behavior that is essentially steering the course? We analyze the relationship between switching variables and other student metrics to better understand how the dynamics of student interaction lead to improved student learning.

Reliable and validated assessments of introductory physics have been instrumental in driving curricular and pedagogical reforms that lead to improved student learning, attitudes toward science, and self-efficacy. At CU Boulder, we are developing an open-ended conceptual instrument (the Colorado Classical Mechanics/math methods Instrument, CCMI) designed, among other purposes, to probe the effectiveness of instruction in middle-division classical mechanics. Questions on the CCMI focus on core concepts, methods, and tools taught in the first half of a two-semester classical mechanics sequence. In this paper, we describe the design and development of this instrument, its intended uses, and initial measurements made in student-centered classes at CU Boulder. We also outline the work necessary to validate the instrument, which has begun by soliciting feedback from both faculty at CU Boulder and other institutions (face validity) and will continue with student interviews (construct validity).

It is generally agreed that the ability to visualize functional dependencies or physical relationships as graphs is an important step in modeling and learning. However, several studies in PER have shown that many students in fact do not master this form of representation and even have misconceptions about the meaning of graphs that impede learning physics concepts. Thus, time needs to be taken in instruction to address these issues. Electronic homework could provide a time-efficient means to give students an opportunity to practice graphing, yet most mainstream course management systems are at best capable of providing interpretation exercises. We believe the ability to construct a graph is of a fundamentally different quality from merely interpreting a given graph, and thus implemented a new graph construction homework type in the LON-CAPA course management system. A study of pre/post-test data using the Test of Understanding Graphs in Kinematics (TUG-K) over several semesters indicates that students learn significantly more from these graph construction problems than from the usual graph interpretation problems and that graph interpretation alone may not have any significant effect.

Teaching Assistants (TAs) have the ability to affect student learning through their interactions with students in ways professors cannot. Analyzing TA-student interactions and subsequent student responses can help us better understand this connection. Yet, when we examine these interactions and responses, we find a complex web of expressions from which we must derive meaning. Several tools have been developed that can assist us in this analysis. But many of these tools, by themselves, focus either too narrowly or too broadly on the data to give us a complete picture. We present one possible method of analysis that uses a combination of these tools to explore data at various grain sizes in an attempt to better describe the interactions and responses we see. We show preliminary analysis from the studio laboratory sections of the Matter and Interactions introductory mechanics course.

This paper explores, from the participants perspective, the Colorado Learning Assistant program. Case studies of four first-time physics LAs are analyzed to understand the expansion and evolution of their views on good teaching, and their understanding of student learning. Findings suggest that through participating in teaching activities, LAs tend to move toward of view of teaching and learning focused on students construction of physics content, and teaching strategies that are adapted to individual students.  We conclude that the repetition of thinking about how students learn, constructing interventions, and reflecting on the results of their actions leads LAs to converge on certain ways of behaving and talking that are more closely aligned with the goals of the LA program. We hypothesize that pedagogical concepts such as formative assessment and dialogic discourse made available through the pedagogy course assist greatly in students convergence on desired practices.

Textbooks can be effective pedagogical tools for learning a discipline. Indeed the primary function of a textbook is as the principle tool for self-learning. But what is the pedagogy of writing a textbook? Can we design a text to maximize learning? What are the properties of a textbook that frame the learning environment? What is taken into account when we determine the fit of a textbook? Pedagogical properties of several textbooks will be examined and a possible framework for the characteristics of effective texts will be presented.

Powerful new observations and advances in computation and visualization have led to a revolution in our understanding of the structure, composition, and evolution of the universe. These gains have been vast, but their impact on education has been limited. Determining the range and frequency of alternative conceptions is an important first step to improving instructional effectiveness. Through analysis of pre-instructional open-ended surveys (N ~ 1250), follow-up interviews, and other assessments, our research group has been classifying students ideas about concepts important to modern cosmology, including the distances, structure, composition, age, expansion, and evolution of the universe. Informed by our research on student learning, we have created a series of web-based cosmology learning modules in which students master the scientific concepts and reasoning processes that lead to our current understanding of the universe, through interactive tasks, prediction and reflection, experimentation, and model building.

In a study of student understanding of the power dissipated through simple networks of resistors, two consistent, contradictory response patterns were identified: a greater equivalent resistance always dissipates more power, and a lesser equivalent resistance always dissipates more power.  After completing one of two sequences of practice-questions, the performance of students who had initially thought that less resistance meant more power improved, while the performance of the opposing group did not -- despite one of the practice sequences specifically addressing the idea that more resistance means more power.  Because one prior conception appears to be susceptible to practice while the other does not, specific attention must be given to interactions between differing ideas and the physical concept being taught.  If an instructor only examines the performance of the entire class, an overall increase in performance might mask a misalignment between instruction and the understanding of a significant number of students.

We investigated from a self-determination theory perspective the role autonomy plays in the student experience in a large-enrollment undergraduate introductory physics course.  We considered the effects of how supportive instructors were of student autonomy (e.g., the instructor listened to how the student would like to do things, took the students perspective, etc.).  We found from a correlational study that students who perceived their instructors to be more supportive of their autonomy tended to perform better and become more interested and less anxious about learning physics.  We also considered the effects of the amount of student autonomy built into the course format.  We discuss the results of a controlled experiment comparing two course formats in which students were given a significantly different number of opportunities to choose how to spend their class time.

Developments in nanotechnology and their applications to daily life have canalized peoples attention to subatomic-level particles and their behaviors. Different features of such particles are used in many fields from medical treatments to manufacturing. Concerning the need for understanding subatomic-world, physics educators have recently argued that some quantum physics concepts (QPCs) should be introduced to students starting from high school (Ireson, 2000). Based on these arguments, we focused on current state-level standards and the first draft of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) to examine the extent to which they address QPCs. The NGSS essentially define the minimum of what all students should learn by the time they finish high school.  In this study, we (a) compared how QPCs are addressed in state-level standards versus NGSS; and (b) analyzed the alignment of QPCs in NGSS and state-level standards with current secondary physics textbooks. We conclude with implications for secondary physics.

AAMC (Association of American Medical Colleges) has recently redefined its understanding of the expectations of students pursuing medical degrees.  This has resulted in a revision of the MCAT and a vision of a recommended undergraduate curriculum based on pre-health competencies.  Pre-Health iCollaborative is a new project established by the AAMC to provide a free online, searchable collection of instructional resources to support undergraduate faculty of all science disciplines who work with students preparing for medical school.  Teaching resources, effective practices, and strategies for including pre-health competencies into existing courses will be made available to faculty at all institutions.  (Sample materials can be found at www.aamc.org/icollaborative/pre-health.)  In this paper, we will describe the status of the project, with a focus on how the PER (Physics Education Research) community can contribute to the success of this project.

The low representation of women in physics is apparent at the undergraduate level through faculty positions. However, when looking at the percentages of women choosing particular subfields within physics it is found that women preferentially choose degree programs in physics education (30%)* and astronomy/astrophysics (40%)** as compared to the average of women in physics overall (18%)**. This study seeks to understand the research subfield choice of women in academic physics at large US research universities through in-depth interviews and a grounded theory analytical approach. Though preliminary results have not shown why women chose their research subfield, it has shown that positive pre-college experiences are bringing these women to physics while supportive advisors and collaboration amongst students are encouraging these women to persist.

Inspired by a paper at last year's PERC conference (AIP Conf Proc 1413 315 (2012)), in which Rebello compared students score estimations with their actual assessment scores, we present results of a study in which students in an introductory physics class were asked to predict their scores on two assessments, one pre- and one post-instruction. Our results show that pre-instruction the academically strongest students in the class tend to underestimate their score slightly, whereas the weakest students overestimate their performance significantly. These results are consistent with the findings of Rebello and demonstrate a well-known cognitive bias (the Dunning-Kruger effect). Post-instruction, we find that the ability of the weakest quartile cohort to accurately predict their own assessment score has improved significantly, and is no longer different to the average discrepancy in predicted score from any other quartile post-instruction. We discuss the implications these results have for instruction and for development of enhanced metacognition amongst physics students.

Instructors frequently observe that students sometimes have significant difficulty activating relevant physics knowledge that they seemingly possess during problem solving. We propose that at least part of the difficulty might be caused by the conventional visual representation used in teaching those knowledge. Most conventional physics representations are developed under the physical limits of pen and paper, and are not optimized to facilitate sense making among novices. When examined from a grounded cognition perspective, some of these representations may interfere with students proper construction of conceptual understanding, and encourage shallow/rote learning of physics rules. Physics rules learned by rote requires a more precise matching of surface features to activate, and poses a higher cognitive cost during implementation. In a clinical study, we demonstrated that by improving the design of physics representation using computer animation, we can change the physics rules activated by students solving certain capacitor circuit problems. Interestingly, this improved representation design shares less surface feature similarity with the problem body when compared to the conventional representation and students are observed to spend less time watching the improved design.

We are in the midst of a three year longitudinal study of faculty who attended the Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshop and who are highly interested in implementing research based reforms.  As part of this study we interviewed 15 faculty at the beginning and end of each semester they taught an introductory course and collected student evaluation data.  From the analysis of these interviews it is clear that faculty practices are directly influenced by students' reactions, both positively and negatively.  When students liked the innovations and responded positively, either by directly expressing their pleasure or by their increased participation in the course activities, faculty were motivated to continue using and possibly increase their level of use of research-based innovations.  Likewise, when faculty reported backing off of innovation use, it was most often due to student complaints about the innovation use and/or students not engaging in course activities.  It is unclear from our study why some faculty were successful at gaining student buy-in but others were not.  In this poster we highlight the need for more research on this issue to better support faculty in their impelentations of research-based instruction.

An objective for science education is to develop students sense of inquiry as "a refinement of everyday thinking" (Einstein, 1936), refinement  toward coherent, mechanistic understanding.  Previous work has applied the theoretical lens of "epistemological framing," (Redish, 2004; Hammer, et al., 2005), with a focus on  how a framing remains stable.  Here, we explore the role of affect in fifth graders' inquiry: Having learned that when objects are heated their molecules spread apart, students struggle to explain why water expands when it freezes. We track the role of affect through a series of mounting tensions and the release of those tensions as students come up with alternate explanations. We argue that affect was central to the stability of students' framing their activity as theoretical inquiry to address an inconsistency. More broadly, we suggest there is evidence of affect playing a role in inquiry  across a range of published case studies.

As part of an ongoing project to examine student learning in upper-division courses in thermal and statistical physics, we have examined student reasoning about the approach of macroscopic objects to thermal equilibrium.  We have examined reasoning in terms of heat transfer, entropy maximization, and statistical treatments of multiplicity and probability.  In the current poster, we present student responses from a set of interviews completed 1-2 years after students had completed the thermal physics course.  Students gave a variety of responses, but most students gave answers that did not correspond to the models that they had been taught in the course.

Drawing appropriate diagrams is a useful problem solving heuristic that can transform a given problem into a representation that is easier to exploit for solving it. A major focus while helping introductory physics students learn problem solving is to help them appreciate that drawing diagrams facilitates problem solution. We conducted an investigation in which 111 students in an algebra-based introductory physics course were subjected to two different interventions during recitation quizzes throughout the semester. They were either (1) asked to solve problems in which the diagrams were drawn for them or (2) explicitly told to draw a diagram. A comparison group was not given any instruction regarding diagrams. We developed a rubric to score the problem-solving performance of students in different intervention groups. We present results for two problems involving electric field and electric force.

Modeling Instruction is a pedagogical approach that focuses instruction on students building, validating and deploying scientific models. Modeling Instruction has been successfully implemented in both high school and university physics courses. Modeling Instruction has been shown to have positive impacts on learning gains, equity, attitudinal shifts, and self-efficacy.  While the success of this pedagogical approach has been recognized within the physics community, the use of models and modeling practices is still being developed for biology. Drawing from the research within the PER community, it is the goal of this poster to describe how Modeling Instruction can be adapted to include an emphasis on models and modeling for undergraduate introductory biology courses. In particular, we will discuss our ongoing work to identify the modeling framework for a two-semester sequence of university biology courses.

At CU Boulder, as part of our broader efforts to transform middle- and upper-division physics courses, we research students' difficulties with particular concepts, methods, and tools in classical mechanics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics. Unsurprisingly, a number of difficulties are related to students' use of mathematical tools (e.g., approximation methods). Previous work has outlined a number of challenges that students must overcome to use mathematical tools fluently in introductory physics (e.g., mapping meaning onto mathematical symbols, Redish 2006). We have begun to develop a conceptual framework to facilitate connecting students' difficulties to challenges with specific mathematical and physical concepts. In this paper, we motivate the need for a framework on the use of mathematics in physics and its utility to both researchers and course instructors. We also present its initial application to frame results from interview data investigating students' use of Taylor series.

Embedding argumentation in science has been shown to improve students problem solving skills and conceptual understanding. We investigate the integration of argumentation in a physics course for pre-service elementary teachers. Students were divided into two groups  construct and evaluate  to solve physics problems using corresponding forms of argumentation. After training in small teams, each group received tasks which required transfer of skills to new problems requiring a different form of argumentation. The process was repeated after three weeks during which more training was provided.  Results indicate no significant improvement of argumentation on team training tasks over this period, but a statistically significant improvement on individual transfer tasks. Thus, three weeks of training did not improve students performance on the team tasks, but it prepared them to learn from their team task and transfer these skills to individual argumentation tasks.

Computational thinking comprises all the processes of conceptualizing how the instantaneous influences on a system construct the system's overall evolution, moment by moment. For example, in physics this might mean conceiving of the flight of a projectile as an iterative process, with each previous moment's velocity and force influencing the subsequent position and velocity in a discrete series of steps.  To engage in the successful practice of computational modeling, a student must apply computational thinking and include a successful explanation of the physical model.  Student dynamical thinking was assessed in a high school Modeling Instruction physics classroom with a written essay and a series of think aloud interviews, where the students produced and discussed a computational model of a baseball in motion via a high-level programming environment (VPython).

Learning Assistants (LAs) have been shown to have better conceptual understanding and more favorable beliefs about science than non-LAs, and are more likely to choose a career in K-12 science teaching (1). We propose that connections between elements of identity, persistence, and participation in an LA program can be explained using the concept of the community of practice and its intimate relationship to identity (2). In separate work, Hazari et al. found that physics identity was highly correlated to expressed career plans in physics (3). We hypothesize that a thriving LA program has many features of a well-functioning community of practice and contributes to all four elements of physics identity: personal interest, student performance, competence, and recognition by others. We explore how this analysis of the LA experience might shape decisions and influence outcomes of adoption and adaptations of the LA model.

development of upper level physics students, we interviewed students

is "the ability to explain a concept to another person".  Further
probing into this common phrase revealed wildly divergent conceptions
about how explaining an idea to another person relates one's own
understanding, or even what "understanding" entails.

Utilizing the integral expression of Coulombs Law to determine the electric potential from a continuous charge distribution is a canonical exercise in Electricity and Magnetism (E&M).  In this study, we use both think-aloud interviews and responses to traditional exam questions to investigate student difficulties with this topic at the upper-division level.  Leveraging a new conceptual framework for the use of mathematics in physics, we discuss how students activate, construct, evaluate and reflect on the integral form of Coulombs Law when solving problems with continuous charge distributions.  We present evidence that junior-level E&M students have difficulty mapping physical systems onto the mathematical expression for the Coulomb potential.  Challenges include difficulty expressing the difference vector in appropriate coordinates as well as determining expressions for the differential charge element and limits of integration for a specific charge distribution.  We discuss possible implications of these findings for future research directions and instructional strategies.

Research on context sensitivity suggests that many students are left in a mixed state of knowledge after an introductory science class. Some students will answer contextually related questions in the same way and some will answer differently based on the context of the question. Seven contextually-related questions were given to two semesters of introductory classes at the University of Arkansas. Model State Estimation is compared to traditional clustering algorithms as mechanisms to separate a class into subgroups with similar answering patterns. The k-means clustering algorithm is used to extract statistically similar subgroups of students. The requirements of the underlying population of students for successful clustering are investigated. For the questions investigated, we find that the class is well represented with only two subgroups, one that answers consistently correctly and one that consistently selects an incorrect answer representing a common misconception.

This study investigates how an urban, high school physics class responded to the inclusion of a classroom set of iPads and associated applications such as screencasting. The participatory roles of students and the norms and practices of the collective class community were examined. Findings suggest that classroom norms and practices were fundamentally altered through the use of iPad technology, to include expanded roles of argumentation and collaboration within and between classes.  Findings also suggest that students were more likely to take leadership roles and teaching responsibilities within the technologically enriched classroom, ultimately allowing them to learn more physics. Videos, observations, interviews, and survey responses were analyzed to provide insight into the nature of these transformed practices. Implications for the use of technology to engage students with physics will be discussed. Conjectures will be made about how the iPad-assisted learning differs from that of desktop or laptop computers.

One of our primary learning goals for our students is: we would like them to be able to learn physics on their own. Unfortunately few existing assessments can assess students ability to learn without being taught. We are developing an exam format which challenges students to work together as a class to tackle a difficult problem that requires them to learn new physics. Rather than restrict their activities, we offer them a resource-rich environment of textbooks and internet access. Students are required to transfer their knowledge by answering a related question on a more standard individual exam the next day.  In this poster we will discuss the format of the exams, background theory, and present evidence of how students are able to learn new physics on their own. Our results show that although students struggle at first, they do surprisingly well once they get used to the format.

The Physics Education Group at the University of Minnesota has been constructing web-based programs that can provide introductory physics students with coaching in the use of an expert-like framework in solving problems. During the Fall 2011 semester, the coaches were introduced into a large (200+ students) section of the introductory mechanics course at the University of Minnesota to assess their usability and gauge students opinions on using them, and also to conduct a pilot study on their educational impact. In this paper, we present results from that implementation, using a problem-solving rubric to analyze students' written solutions to problems on mid-semester quizzes and the final exam. The rubric evaluates a student's problem-solving performance along five axes based on expert-novice problem solving research. Other diagnostic results such as the FCI and CLASS survey will also be included to give a more comprehensive picture of the educational impact of the coaches.

In an effort to shift course goals away from equation memorizing, I allowed two different introductory physics classes the opportunity to prepare a card or sheet of notes for the exams.  I analyze and categorize the items students choose to include on a case-by-case basis.  Students include some mixture of definitions (both mathematical and otherwise), equations (both general and specific), unit information, physical constants, statements of laws or concepts, math review, guides to symbols and variables, diagrams, and worked examples.  I compare my two classes, look at some individual students in depth, and try to gain insight on how we can use these artifacts to see what students perceive as important in the courses (or at least what's worth committing to paper).

A great deal of literature exists surrounding the misconceptions that students have regarding the moon, specifically how the moon phases and eclipses occur.  These studies provide teachers with information regarding what misconceptions their students may come to the classroom with as well as some ideas as to how to approach and correct them.  However, these methods are not always validated with classroom-based research, and much of the research that has been done is in the high school and college setting.  As such, we have undertaken a study to investigate what a group of middle school students know about the moon pre-instruction, and how hands-on activities and computer simulations affect student learning and understanding of these topics.  The results of this project show that neither supplementation was distinguishably more effective in improving student test scores, as measured by Hake gains; this may be an artifact of high pre-test scores, as described herein.

As part of the tutorial component of introductory calculus-based physics at the University of Washington, students take weekly pretests. Pretests are so named because they precede each tutorial, but they are frequently administered after lecture instruction. For some pretest question we have accumulated thousands of responses, from dozens of course sections representing different conditions with respect to class composition, prior instruction, etc. In this paper three questions serve as representative examples. For each question, we examine the variation in student performance (defined as the proportion of students who answered correctly) across all sections for which data are available, and for subsets of the data categorized according to the amount of relevant prior instruction each class had received.

Introductory calculus-based physics includes the study of both vector and scalar topics. Typical research on student understanding has focused on the topics themselves; in this poster, we compare results across multiple topics drawn across the curriculum to track students' understanding as a function of time. Data was collected weekly using conceptual surveys from students attending Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and the United States Military Academy at West Point throughout the introductory calculus-based physics sequence.  Students view problems involving vector concepts and problems involving scalar concepts differently depending on whether the current topic of instruction is vectors or scalars. The analysis suggests an interference between what is taught in class and the students' ability to solve vector and scalar problems.

An important goal of physics instruction is learning how to think like a physicist. We surveyed n=63 students in a calculus-based introductory mechanics course about what they think thinking like a physicist means, as well as what kinds of reasoning they can do now but used to be difficult for them, what they do when they are stuck on a problem, and how they know when they understand a topic or problem well. Nearly half of the students report visualization and understanding physics questions as reasoning that used to be difficult for them. A similar fraction of students consider being able to solve problems straightforwardly as the primary indicator of their understanding of a physics concept or problem. We coded students responses and performed a cluster analysis to identify groups of students with similar patterns of responses. We discuss this analysis and the pedagogical implications of the results.

An important part of doing research is crafting useful definitions for one's particular purposes.  Scientists need to be able to identify vague or unscientific terms and meanings and refine them into clearly articulated ideas.  This work is not done in isolation, but rather, members of the community must come together to decide on mutually agreed upon definitions.  But how are words defined and mutual understanding achieved?  What skills do physics students already have along these lines and what new skills must be supported?  And how does language itself support and constrain this work?  This talk will focus on a study of undergraduate physics majors where small groups of 3-4 students are asked to categorize and define the physical phenomenon of threshold in an open-ended design task.  We will present on skills we have identified as important to making definitions and discuss ways that language plays an important role in this process.

While most PhET simulations are designed for college, they are often used at lower levels, including middle school (MS). We are now studying how MS students interact with and learn from these simulations, extracting insights about design for this grade-level and more broadly. Here, we present a case study of the methods and design philosophy involved in redesigning a simulation  Energy Skate Park (ESP)  for effective use in MS.  We conducted think-aloud interviews with MS students, identifying features that caused confusion or unproductive distraction, as well as features inconsistent with grade-appropriate learning goals.  Drawing on these data and our broader research base, we developed Energy Skate Park Basics (ESPB). Interviews on ESPB demonstrate increased usability and learning for MS students. We suggest that the success of ESPB is due to age-appropriate implicit scaffolding, a design framework that reduces the amount of explicit instruction needed to facilitate learning.

At the University of Colorado Boulder, the LA program has grown to the point that we now run 3 sections of the LA pedagogy course. This poster is presented by a former LA, now a doctoral student in Computer Science Education, who is now teaching and modifying the LA pedagogy course at CU Boulder. As one of the first LAs for the Applied Mathematics department, a unique perspective is brought to the LA pedagogy course which was initially designed by a physics education researcher and a high school physics teacher. Since the pedagogy course reaches diverse STEM student majors, the course must continually be made relevant for all students. Here we present a unique perspective from two angles: (1) from the angle of a computer science/math major teaching in what was a physics-centric LA pedagogy course and (2) the perspective of a former LA who is now taking action toward educational change. Finally, we discuss this final measure of success of the LA program that is rarely discussed in the literature: the recruitment of LAs into advanced doctoral programs in STEM education as they establish their agenda for educational change.

Students have difficulties comprehending science texts. The interrogation method, which prompts students to read sentences from the text and answer, Why is this true? has been developed to enhance students ability to read science texts. To enact this method, instructors must choose sentences that are both important conceptually and deeply interrogatable. We explored the use of this method in an introductory physics course for non-physics majors. The teaching assistants, learning assistants, and the course instructor chose sentences for each chapter of the text, and the students were asked to interrogate 2-4 of the sentences each chapter. We analyzed the conceptual importance of the sentences and their interrogatability, as well as their underlying epistemologies. We then analyzed the accuracy and epistemologies of the student responses. Based on the analysis of the chosen sentences and student responses, we developed a model for choosing productive sentences to interrogate.

This poster documents the Winter Break Effect in the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) for a calc-based introductory physics class at a two-year college.   By evaluating pre and post course results from the CLASS, previous publications have shown that students tend to have a less expert-like opinion of studying physics after taking an introductory physics class.  Although this result was seen in the data provided here, we also saw that by merely waiting until after the winter break and surveying the same students at the beginning of the second term, their opinions appeared to shift back towards the more expert-like end.  Although the statistics in this data sample are limited, the Winter Break Effect shown may imply that student opinions evaluated by the CLASS may depend on when in the term the survey is given.

Despite the extensive body of research that supports scientific inquiry and argumentation as cornerstones of physics learning, these strategies continue to be virtually absent in most classrooms, especially those that involve students who are learning English as a second language. This study presents results from an investigation of 3rd grade students discourse about how length and tension affect the sound produced by a string. These students came from a variety of language backgrounds, and all were learning English as a second language. Our results demonstrate varying levels and uses of experiential, imaginative, and mechanistic reasoning strategies. Using specific examples from students discourse, we will demonstrate some of the productive and challenging aspects of working within multiple language frameworks for making sense of physics. Conjectures will be made about how to utilize physics as a context for English Language Learners to negotiate ideas, while developing their competence in the English language.

In reformed classrooms that utilize student-student interactions, a students concerns can often be resolved through student-student discourse with minimal to no direct input from the instructor. To gain insight into such interactions, we used video data from a Florida International University reformed Physics I classroom. We micro-analyzed a segment in which the discourse between a group of three students leads to the resolution of a concern. In this study, we identified a pattern of discourse, which we are calling a Learning Arc. In this poster, we present the Learning Arc as a cyclical process by which students use discourse as a means to achieve a consensus that resolves a concern.

Increasingly, learning scholars have focused on how race, culture and class have been used to define deficit-oriented discourses about students from non-dominant communities understandings, thinking, experiences, and language use (e.g., what comprises an effective explanation or convincing data; what smart looks and sounds like) and restrict the intellectual opportunities these youth have to learn in school (e.g. Lee, 2009; Gutierrez et. al, 2009; Barton & Tan, 2008). We have sought to understand how these issues place epistemological demands on Indigenous students, specifically in thinking and sense-making about the natural world towards the goal of creating more affective learning environments. Through a micro-analysis of two contexts, one an informal interaction between a child and their parent, and one in a learning environment, I explore how relational epistemologies, and variations in causality and inference are embedded in these issues and raise questions and possibilities in the design of learning environments.

I will talk about two different ways of thinking about identity as it relates to learning, and discuss the importance of integrating both perspectives. First, I'll talk about practice-linked identity: a sense of self that develops through participation in a set of cultural or collective practices. These identities are shifting and changeable, and are developed in relation to other people in the context. Second, I'll talk about social identity: a sense of self --or a perception of others -- based on socially meaningful categories like race or gender. These identities are seen as quite static (although they may not be experienced that way) and are related to broader systems of oppression in society. I will give examples from my research in mathematics education, and discuss how these concepts can be useful in the study of physics education.

As schools become increasingly irrelevant to meaningful learning for young people, they also fail in fulfilling their social equalizing agenda. There is a growing disconnect between the interests and everyday practices of our nation's students and formal schooling's approaches to engaging them in rigorous, meaningful, and relevant learning. Of concern, there are social and cognitive, as well as personal, institutional, and economic consequences to disconnected learning. Today's students move across a range of contexts and produce artifacts that reflect the intercultural, hybrid, and multimodal practices of which they are part.  These repertoires developed across the ecologies of interest and everyday life should be cultivated as important dimensions to consequential learning. From a cultural historical learning perspective, transformative learning involves shifts between and across new combinations of contexts and tools that can be leveraged across ecologies and domains of learning (Engestrom, 2003; Gutierrez, 2008). Drawing on the best of what we know about how people learn, this paper focuses on how we can ratchet up learning across a range of ecologies by designing openings and forms of support that create opportunities for new learning pathways into the future. In particular, it focuses on the affordances of syncretic and connected learning approaches in supporting the development of toolkits that have utility across tasks, purposes, disciplinary boundaries, learning environments, and future-oriented trajectories and identities.

In this talk, I will present a perspective that conceptualizes learning in cultural practice terms.  Cultural practices are differently sized patterns of interaction among people and things to which people orient and hold each other accountable. Learning then involves coming to participate in these patterns of interaction and undergoing possible changes to body, mind, and identity in the process. Cultural practices are often knotted together to make normative cultural paths, through and around which people traverse specific pathways.
Drawing on a conceptual framework for studying young peoples learning pathways toward becoming engineers (Stevens et al., 2008), this presentation will examine the knowledge and identity formation processes in everyday physics, physics education, and professional physics. I will consider an additional dimension of importance, how people individually and with cultural support, navigate through sanctioned institutional passage points and rituals. I will use this framework to generate a set of future-looking questions for physics learning and physics education research.

PER has grown by drawing on theories and methods in cognitive science, psychology, sociology, and other fields outside of physics. PER has assembled these various perspectives into its own approaches to education research. In this session, presenters will describe their recent efforts to bring new approaches from outside of PER to their work. While varied in content, these efforts will converge along several themes: the scope, power, and limitations of these new-to-PER perspectives, as well as alignment between theory and methods. Presenters will discuss the process of adopting outside theories and methods to PER specific research problems. Participants can gain insight into the specific theories and methods used by presenters. Following the conference theme, we also hope to present a general case for how PER can benefit and grow by following its own tradition of looking outside itself.

Members of the PER community have recently been using classroom culture as a lens to examine current pedagogies, as well as to develop new and effective instructional methods.  As such, many researchers are asking what makes classroom cultures productive?  What beliefs, commitments, discourses, and practices do students and instructors bring into classrooms? How is the creation of a culture negotiated between its members? This session seeks to address these questions by presenting new findings from various physics learning contexts.  Attendees will learn about: the influences of urban undergraduates cultural background on teaching and learning physics, how a high school teacher's responsiveness to students learning preferences changed her classroom instruction, how a group of physics graduate students enacts undergraduate courses that reflect their affirmative value system, and how evidence-focused labs and adaptations to a research-based curriculum influenced high school students participation in scientific discourse.  An interactive discussion will follow the presentations.

The Colorado Learning Assistant model has demonstrated effectiveness in improving learning gains, improving student attitudes, and in better preparing teachers to teach in K-12 schools, through CU Boulder studies. In this session, we explore the replication of such studies at other universities as well as the development of explanatory models for LA program effectiveness. Posters will present traditional measures of program effectiveness such as learning gains, attitudes, and DFW rates as well as how these measures play out with populations traditionally underrepresented in physics. Further, by in-depth case studies of LAs' experiences, their experiences in the pedagogy course, and their written and verbal reflections, we establish models of identity through participation that can help us understand why the program is effective and what it truly affects. Ultimately, by critically evaluating traditional measures of program effectiveness in light of explanatory models of LA program effectiveness, we seek to establish an agenda for future research on personal and social elements that are critical to the success of an LA-style program, or any program that capitalizes on the development of identity through participation.

What do American cookies, Korean immigrants, Danish networks, and chemistry students have in common? Work on identity often focuses on how an individual perceives oneself without drawing attention to the role that an individual plays in larger community contexts. However, alternative interpretations on identity focus on the role of positioning within communities and how identities are shaped by interactions with members of those communities. This targeted poster session will focus on understanding what it means to be a part of a community of scientists and learners. The posters presented in this session use a variety of methodological tools and analytic lenses to investigate how communities form and invite members to participate. Each of the presenters will discuss the role that participation in these communities play in the shaping of identity for individuals and for the communities themselves.

The establishment of hierarchical social structures, either explicit and conscious or implicit and unconscious, can hinder student participation resulting in their marginalization and disengagement.  As part of the regular process of education, students experience social hierarchies in their studies stemming from aspects of their "invisible backpacks" and from day-to-day experiences in the classroom.  In this symposium, we explore how social hierarchies arising from both of these sources are formed and the implications for student engagement with physics, physics identity development, and physics participation.  In the former case, the impacts of sociocultural factors (including immigrant generation and college generation) are examined with respect to physical science career interests.  In the latter case, the effects of teacher practices including positioning and authoritativeness on student engagement and attachment to physics are studied.  These results are important for understanding how social hierarchies can impede entry into physics-related fields and how to address these concerns.

The PER community has long been in need of a database where teachers can upload student scores on PER-based assessment instruments and get analysis of their results along with peer group averages to use as a measure of comparison.  Such a database would also be a boon to researchers who could have access to large amounts of data from diverse institutions.  The PER User's Guide (http://perusersguide.org) and Grove City College are collaborating to develop an assessment results database. Before putting this database on line, however, many logistical issues need to be addressed: usability, privacy concerns, IRB approval, authenticating users, concerns of assessment authors, etc.  Anyone interested in providing input and feedback on this project is welcome to join the dialogue.

The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are currently under development by a multi-state collaboration.  The NGSS are structured around core ideas in each discipline, cross-cutting concepts, and science and engineering practices.  These standards will direct future state wide assessments and therefore K-12 science and physics instruction.  Experience has shown that standards and the corresponding assessments can bring about both positive change and unintended consequences in K-12 physics education, in affected by the preparation of teachers, curricular materials available, and methods of assessment.  In this roundtable discussion, we will collectively explore the impact of standards and assessment, discuss to what extent the educational goals of the PER community align with those of the NGSS, think about ways the NGSS could be leveraged to address our goals of improving physics education, and identify research, teacher preparation, materials and assessment development activities the community might undertake to support good adoption of the NGSS.

At Florida International University we have implemented a learning assistant program (LAP) based on the Colorado Learning Assistant Model.[1] As a part of this program, students take a course on science and mathematics education theory and practice in which they are required to submit written reflections. The purpose of this study is to determine if students writing assignments provide evidence that they are reflecting on their teaching experiences and to characterize the different ways in which they reflect on those experiences. In our investigation we adapted a rubric from Hatton and Smith[2]. We show how this rubric helps us to categorize the depth of student reflections and provide them with constructive feedback.

We present the performance of nearly 5000 students on a standardized assessment of force and motion (Force Concept Inventory) for two fundamentally different physics curricula; a traditional course based on the Knight text and a reform course based on the text of Chabay and Sherwood, Matter and Interactions (M&I). The traditional course is a standard physics curriculum with particular emphasis on constant force motion. The M&I course is a modern approach to physics instruction with computer modeling and an emphasis on the generality and dynamics of Newton's Second Law. We nd poorer performance for students who have taken the M&I course as compared to students taking the standard course. This under-performance is consistent despite the superior performance by M&I students on common exam problems in other areas of mechanics. We offer explanations for this consistent under-performance in the realm of force and motion as well as some results from recent work to combat these misconceptions in the M&I course.

There have been several studies in recent years that have demonstrated that upper-division students struggle with partial derivatives and the complicated chain rules ubiquitous in thermodynamics. We asked several experts (primarily faculty who teach thermodynamics) to solve a challenging and novel thermodynamics problem to understand how they navigate through this maze. What we found was a tremendous variety in solution strategies and sense-making tools, both within and between individuals. This case study focuses on one particular expert: his solution path and use of sense-making tools. This expert was also asked to work the same problem using differentials (an approach taught in the Paradigms in Physics: Energy and Entropy course). This presentation will also discuss his reflections on how a differential method compared to his own approach and on the utility of using differentials in teaching undergraduates.

The Compass Project is a self-formed group of graduate and undergraduate students in the physical sciences at UC Berkeley. Our goals are to improve undergraduate physics education, provide opportunities for professional development, and increase retention of students--especially those from populations typically underrepresented in the physical sciences. Compass fosters a diverse, collaborative student community by providing a wide range of services, including a summer program and fall/spring seminar courses. We describe Compass's cultural values, discuss how community members are introduced to and help shape those values, and demonstrate how a single set of values informs the structure of both our classroom and organization. We emphasize that all members of the Compass community participate in, and benefit from, our cultural values, regardless of status as student, teacher, or otherwise.

Entropy is typically not a central focus either in introductory university physics textbooks or in national standards for secondary education. However, entropy is a key part of a strong conceptual model of energy, especially for connecting energy conservation to energy degradation and the irreversibility of processes. We are developing a conceptual model of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics as they relate to energy, with the goal of creating models and representations that link energy and entropy in a meaningful way for learners analyzing real-life energy scenarios. We expect this model to help learners better understand how their everyday experiences relate to formal physics analyses. Our goal is to develop tools for use with elementary and secondary teachers and secondary and university students.

When becoming a member of a community of practice, a novice must adopt certain community norms to participate, and these include the social norms of the group. Using the analytical perspective of Legitimate Peripheral Participation in a Community of Practice, this paper explores the social role of cookies as agents for community participation and membership in one physics research group. We analyze data from an ethnographic case study of a physics research group weekly research meeting. The mentors bring cookies to each meeting and view the cookies as a token of appreciation for the graduate students' work. These cookies take on a subtler role of initiating guests and students into scientific conversations and participation. Via the cookies, members also share personal histories and stories that help members validate their participation. The study of social norms in this research group is part of a larger study of physics expert identity development.

We compared contextual characteristics that impacted the nature and substance of "summarizing discussions" between a physics and a chemistry classroom in an Hispanic-serving urban high school.  Specifically, we evaluate structural components of curricula necessary to develop a culture of critical inquiry.  Through implementing the Physics and Everyday Thinking (PET) curriculum in the physics course, we found that students' participation in summarizing discussions demonstrated critical thinking, critical evaluation, and use of laboratory evidence to support ideas. We then implemented a model similar to PET in the chemistry course. However, chemistry students' participatory statements lacked evidence, opposition and critical evaluation, and required greater teacher facilitation. We hypothesize that the designed laboratories and the research basis of PET influenced the extent to which physics students verbalized substantive scientific thought, authentic appeals to evidence, and a sense of empowerment to participate in the classroom scientific community. Classroom data and teacher reflections will be discussed.

In today's globally-engaged and technology-rich educational environments, an online resource where concept inventory (CI) developers and users can access, discuss, develop, and refine concept inventories and their uses is a needed resource.  ciHUB.org meets this need by providing a shared space to researchers and users where inventories can be uploaded and focused discussions can ensue.  Because a wide variety of different CIs can be gathered in this one-stop virtual community, the gathering of data across multiple CIs and longitudinal tracking of student learning is now possible.  Therefore, this type of community facilitates research not just within a specific topic area relative to a specific CI, but it also allows research between CIs.  For example, the Force Concept Inventory might be the correct pre-test to the Concept Assessment Tool for Statics, typically a second-year course in the engineering curriculum.  This type of research could have larger implications as CI development progresses into upper division course content.

Chicago State University has been involved in curriculum development, teacher preparation, and education research that target urban physics learners on the south-side of Chicago.  Through this work we have begun to recognize specific cultural norms that our students bring to the classroom.  These cultural norms appear to help our students establish strong communities in classes.  Because of the homogeneity of our population, with most students coming from within a five-mile radius of our campus, there are a set of shared experiences that help establish a level of trust and sense of community that manifests itself in the science learning environment.  Aspects of community also play a major role in the preparation of teachers.  In this talk we discuss our understanding of CSU student culture, its importance in the development of community, and its role in our physics classrooms as well as its role in the preparation of future physics teachers.

Establishing validity and reliability is a necessary step in any conceptual assessment instrument.  But once validity and reliability are established, it is not the end of the story.  Reliability and validity are not an inherent property of the assessment instrument or its individual items, but something that must be reestablished with any changes of the instrument items, order, administration techniques or population being studied.   In this paper we will discuss how validity and reliability can be established or reestablished.  We will also discuss common instances in instrument development and use that requires reliability and validity to be reestablished.

Transforming learning environments for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students requires merging of theories of learning and state-of-the-art assessment tools that allow faculty to identify patterns of conceptual understanding and misconceptions. Conventional measurement/evaluation approaches typically do not help faculty discover the extent to which students have actually acquired conceptual fluency within a particular subject. To this end, STEM disciplines are increasingly using Concept Inventory (CI) assessment to measure the value-added to student learning through new methods of teaching important material. 

The paper describes the creation of a virtual community referred to as ciHUB.org, which is a cohesive, borderless community of CI developers, researchers, faculty and students. This national/international collaborative effort was created to support both: a) continued development, refinement, analysis, and application of multiple CI instruments; and b) engagement of the engineering STEM education community in productive conversations about assessing and improving conceptual understanding.

In statistical mechanics there are two quantities that directly relate to the probability that a system at a temperature fixed by a thermal reservoir has a particular energy. The density of states function is related to the multiplicity of the system and indicates that occupation probability increases with energy. The Boltzmann factor is related to the multiplicity of the reservoir and indicates that occupation probability decreases with energy. This seems contradictory until one remembers that a complete probability distribution is determined by the total multiplicity of the system and its surroundings, requiring the product of these two functions. We present evidence from individual and group interviews that students knew how each of these functions relates to multiplicity but did not recognize the need to combine the two to characterize the physical scenario.

Science researchers have been concerned to understand the ways in which science learning and social relationships are connected. Networks of social interactions have preciously been used to get snapshot pictures of broad aspects of student interactions. Here, I include (1) multiple interaction categories and (2) student self reports of these multiple interaction categories over a period of a semester to create sequences of different types of specific academic and social networks. The cohort is primarily first year physics majors from a Danish university. Once established, a cluster algorithm splits each network into groups of students. The stability across categories and time of groups as well as the attributes of students in each group characterize the cohort as a set of communities of practice. Seen in this way, the networks investigate the dynamics of quantifiable aspects of communities of physics learners in a particular setting.

In the present study, I define identity as a type of personhood--the ways in which an individual and surrounding people view the person--that the individual develops as participating in various local, social practices. In science classrooms, students shape their identities along various dimensions, such as identity in relation to the classroom community, science, and racial, ethnic, and linguistic groups. These multiple identities are not independent but often intertwined. An analysis of a-year-long ethnographic study in a high school biology class shows how Korean immigrant students' identities with respect to their immigrant status and language use influence the ways in which they participate in science classroom practices and their participations are perceived. Findings of the study suggest that students' classroom participations and identities in a classroom community should be understood in conjunction with their identities along other social dimensions that are locally constructed.

When science undergraduates begin their upper-division coursework, their declaration of major becomes more concrete and meaningful as they have opportunities to interact more deeply with the community of their chosen discipline. In the process of completing a major, students transition their identity towards being a member of their field. In Wenger's community of practice framework, community membership is built on alignment of common goals, participation in social interactions, and perception of belonging in the community. But what does it mean to be a chemist or physicist from the students' perspective? In this study, we examine junior-level chemistry and physics majors' ideas about their science identity through semi-structured interviews and prompted reflective journals. We compare and contrast how chemistry and physics students negotiate their identity as members in their disciplinary field in terms of practice, qualifications, attitude, and in relation to other STEM communities.

The Colorado Learning Assistant (LA) model transforms large-enrollment undergraduate courses using talented undergraduate STEM majors to facilitate small-group interaction among enrolled students. The Colorado LA model has proven to be effective in increasing learning gains in LA-supported transformed courses and LAs themselves have been shown to outperform their peers in upper division courses. The LA model has also proven to be successful in recruiting talented physics majors to teaching careers and positively impacting their K-12 instruction. In this study we evaluate the impact of the LA model on the percentage of students who receive a final grade of D, final grade of F, or withdraw (DFW) from introductory physics courses at the University of Colorado-Boulder. Results will be reported and discussed.

Computer simulations are increasingly popular teaching and learning tools among physics educators. In this poster, we present implicit scaffolding, a theoretical framework that underlies the design of PhET simulations. This framework is based on the tool-mediated learning theory of Vygotsky and the affordance-constraint theory of Norman, a pioneer in human-computer interaction. While developed in the context of computer simulations, implicit scaffolding also lends itself well to non-computer-based learning tools, such as lab equipment or textbooks. We will demonstrate the use of implicit scaffolding with cases of middle school students building circuits using both a simulation and real equipment. 6th grade students were readily able to build working circuits using both the simulator and real equipment with little to no instructions. Our central claim is that learning tools designed according to implicit scaffolding can "guide without students feeling guided," allowing students to feel a heightened sense of ownership and agency.

We describe changes in a physics teacher's pedagogy and cultural awareness that resulted from her students' involvement in reforming their classroom.  For this case study, we examined a veteran high school teacher's semester-long use of CMPLE (the Cogenerative Mediation Process for Learning Environments) in her Modeling Instruction classroom. CMPLE is a formative intervention designed to help students and instructors collaborate to change classroom dynamics, based on how closely the environment matches their learning preferences. Analysis of classroom videos, interviews, and other artifacts indicates that adapting the environment to align with the preferences of that shared culture affected the instructor in complex ways. We will trace her teaching practices and her self-described awareness of the culture of learning, to highlight notable changes. The teacher espoused deeper understanding of her students' physics learning experience, which she gained from including students in responding to their own individual and collective learning preferences.

During the 2011-2012 academic year, West Virginia University began a learning assistants (LA) program in its introductory calculus-based physics course targeted at increasing course effectiveness and recruiting future STEM teachers. The LA program was modeled after the Colorado Learning Assistant model. This poster describes the setting and initial results from the implementation including changes in learning gains (measured with the FMCE) and attitudes (measured with the CLASS). These data are combined with demographic data about the individual students and compared to baseline data collected during the spring semester of 2011. Particular attention is paid to whether the changes in the modified course have affected under-represented populations in physics any differently from the overall effect in the course.

From fall 2008 to fall 2010 extensive data were collected within the large-lecture introductory calculus-based physics course at Oregon State University for the purpose of measuring the efficacy of course reform and studying student identity development in learning communities. Simultaneously, data were collected at the University of Cape Town in a completely un-related study, also within a large-lecture introductory course, but for understanding how students make sense of measurements in the laboratory.  Trends seen in both of these settings led to an in-depth analysis of the wording used by the instructor to introduce in-class activities or phrase questions to probe student understanding.  We found strong correlations between authoritativeness of statements and a reduction in student engagement in both environments. This poster briefly presents the results of these studies, proposes a model for understanding this effect from a cognitive perspective, and ties the findings to the literature on identity and community.

Cognitive developmental psychology often seeks to describe students' qualitative understanding of physical phenomena.  In turn, educators can use this research to improve instruction.  Siegler (1981) developed the "rule assessment" model for characterizing children's development of multi-factor reasoning.  By conceptualizing a multi-factor domain as a phenomenon comprised of dominant and subordinate factors, this model analyzes students' responses to discern whether their thinking appropriately includes neither factor, only one factor, or the relationship between both factors.  Students' rule levels can then be used in future analyses.  Here, we provide several examples and a demonstration of how we have used this method with middle-school students who learned about torque, projectile motion, and collisions using different instructional methods around simulations.  We show how the technique helps characterize various levels of qualitative reasoning, how these relate to quantitative reasoning, and how the method helps pinpoint the factors students attend to in their reasoning.

Many students are disempowered in physics classes finding them to be more difficult, unpleasant, narrow, and masculine when compared to other subjects.  Such disempowerment can lead students to limit their engagement and rely on rote learning strategies.  This study explores how physics teachers can help students engage with the material and develop their physics identities by obscuring traditional classroom hierarchies.    Employing a positionality lens on case studies of four high school physics teachers, we coded teachers' behavioral cues that contributed to the relationship structure in the classroom.  Our findings suggest that teachers' physical cues (space and hierarchical stance occupied), structural cues (dynamic nature of the classroom allowing alternating roles), contextual cues (including students' thoughts and experiences), and social cues (obscuring traditional boundaries between teacher and student) affect the social distance between the teacher, students, and content.  This social distance can moderate students' level of engagement and ultimately their physics identity development.

The practice of proximal formative assessment  the continual, responsive attention to students' developing understanding as it is expressed in real time  depends on students' sharing their ideas with instructors and on teachers' attending to them. Rogerian psychology presents an account of the conditions under which proximal formative assessment may be promoted or inhibited: (1) Normal classroom conditions, characterized by evaluation and attention to learning targets, may present threats to students' sense of their own competence and value, causing them to conceal their ideas and reducing the potential for proximal formative assessment. (2) In contrast, discourse patterns characterized by positive anticipation and attention to learner ideas increase the potential for proximal formative assessment and promote self-directed learning. We present an analysis methodology based on these principles and demonstrate its utility for understanding episodes of university physics instruction.

We recount research questions and theoretical motivations that led us to adopt network analysis in understanding the formation of a learning community as an illustrative example of Social Network Analysis (SNA) as applied to PER.  Social Network Analysis (SNA) and the more general form, Network Analysis, are a set of representational and quantitative tools that can be used to identify patterns among complex, interconnected data. Thus the methodology is well suited seeking patterns among humans engaged in learning within a disciplinary context as we pursue in PER. Two recent papers in PRST-PER [1,2] reflect the flexibility of NA , drawing on different data types (transcripts and surveys), and addressed very different questions (community and epistemic development). While this methodology is well established in other fields, it remains in its infancy in PER; thus the limitations are not well known nor are the approaches clearly fruitful as applied to learning.

This paper explores, from the participants perspective, the Colorado Learning Assistant program. Case studies of four first-time physics LAs are analyzed to understand the expansion and evolution of their views on good teaching, and their understanding of student learning. Findings suggest that through participating in teaching activities, LAs tend to move toward of view of teaching and learning focused on students construction of physics content, and teaching strategies that are adapted to individual students.  We conclude that the repetition of thinking about how students learn, constructing interventions, and reflecting on the results of their actions leads LAs to converge on certain ways of behaving and talking that are more closely aligned with the goals of the LA program. We hypothesize that pedagogical concepts such as formative assessment and dialogic discourse made available through the pedagogy course assist greatly in students convergence on desired practices.

As part of an ongoing project to examine student learning in upper-division courses in thermal and statistical physics, we have examined student reasoning about the approach of macroscopic objects to thermal equilibrium.  We have examined reasoning in terms of heat transfer, entropy maximization, and statistical treatments of multiplicity and probability.  In the current poster, we present student responses from a set of interviews completed 1-2 years after students had completed the thermal physics course.  Students gave a variety of responses, but most students gave answers that did not correspond to the models that they had been taught in the course.

Learning Assistants (LAs) have been shown to have better conceptual understanding and more favorable beliefs about science than non-LAs, and are more likely to choose a career in K-12 science teaching (1). We propose that connections between elements of identity, persistence, and participation in an LA program can be explained using the concept of the community of practice and its intimate relationship to identity (2). In separate work, Hazari et al. found that physics identity was highly correlated to expressed career plans in physics (3). We hypothesize that a thriving LA program has many features of a well-functioning community of practice and contributes to all four elements of physics identity: personal interest, student performance, competence, and recognition by others. We explore how this analysis of the LA experience might shape decisions and influence outcomes of adoption and adaptations of the LA model.

Research-based innovations in physics education often restructure social interactions in the classroom and introduce new tools. Assessments such as pre-post testing can provide an overall evaluation of these changes, but do not provide insight into the process by which they are enacted. Activity theory provides a framework for understanding the complex classroom situation through structured attention to roles, rules or norms, community, and tools. Activity theory is particular useful in diagnosing failure modes and understanding unexpected outcomes. I will describe how activity theory can be used to understand efforts to support interactive pedagogy with technologies such as digital cameras, photo sharing websites, and in-class videos of experiments. I will characterize the circumstances under which innovations in pedagogy and technology support each other, leading to results that would not have been possible with either alone.

Students enter college with social, cultural, and economic resources (well described by Bourdieu's concepts of habitus and capital) which significantly impact their successes, goals, and actions.  Two such sociocultural dimensions are students' immigrant generation and college generation status.  The two principal conceptualizations of immigration are: a bottom-up model in which new immigrants start at society's lowest echelons and work their way upwards, and an "immigrant advantage" model, which posits that immigrants have specific values, skills, and beliefs which provide social advantages.  Our prior research found first generation immigrants were significantly more likely to choose physical science and engineering majors. Here, drawing on a national sample of 7505 freshmen enrolled in college English, we compare and contrast the effects of immigrant generation with college generation status to explore some of the challenges faced by the first in the family to become an American and/or go to college.

At the University of Colorado Boulder, the LA program has grown to the point that we now run 3 sections of the LA pedagogy course. This poster is presented by a former LA, now a doctoral student in Computer Science Education, who is now teaching and modifying the LA pedagogy course at CU Boulder. As one of the first LAs for the Applied Mathematics department, a unique perspective is brought to the LA pedagogy course which was initially designed by a physics education researcher and a high school physics teacher. Since the pedagogy course reaches diverse STEM student majors, the course must continually be made relevant for all students. Here we present a unique perspective from two angles: (1) from the angle of a computer science/math major teaching in what was a physics-centric LA pedagogy course and (2) the perspective of a former LA who is now taking action toward educational change. Finally, we discuss this final measure of success of the LA program that is rarely discussed in the literature: the recruitment of LAs into advanced doctoral programs in STEM education as they establish their agenda for educational change.

The study of the identity processes of women of color in science-based fields helps us (a) find ways to support similar women, and (b) study the dynamics of inequity, within and beyond science. Participants in this study (a Black woman, a Latina, and an American Indian woman) survived inadequate high schools and discouraging college science departments to win formal recognition (fellowships, publications). Qualitative methods were designed around multiracial feminist theory and Black feminist precepts of caring and personal accountability, the use of concrete experience and of dialogue. Participants reported conflicts between their identities as women of color and as credible science students, and having racist, sexist identities ascribed to them. All became more adept at fending off negative ascription and all found settings with less identity conflict; their ability to read a situation and quickly adjust helped them survive. But the fact that they needed to do this is unjust.

Although Israeli  high school physics students solve problems using the expression E=mc<sup>2</sup>, the origin of this expression and its  deep conceptual meaning are hardly ever discussed due to students' limited prior knowledge. In 1946, a year after the atomic bombs were first dropped, Albert Einstein published a popular scientific article explaining the equivalence between mass and energy to the general public and the implications of this principle for our daily lives. This paper describes the utilization of Einstein's article in a high school physics lesson. It discusses the instructional affordances of exemplary popular scientific texts through an analysis of students' learning, in comparison to previous studies on the instruction and learning of the equivalence of mass and energy, and in relation to features of exemplary popular scientific writing reflected in Einstein's article. The research is supported by a Marie Curie International Outgoing Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Program.

Traditionally, many programs and policy interventions focused on improving the academic success of women and minorities in STEM are grounded largely in the good intentions and social justice motivations of program leaders and policymakers.  Meanwhile, research on effective intervention strategies has been meager, as are evidence-based policy prescriptions or legislative actions.  In this paper, we will discuss how research such as the papers presented in this session can be (and recently have been) applied during the current STEM-focused education policy context, often in unexpectedly political ways.  While we applaud both the political energy and growing opportunities directed toward STEM education and careers, including considerable focus on broadening participation in these fields, we observe greater increases linguistic sophistication than in substantive and progressive policy intervention. We will provide examples of evidenced takeaways for politics and policy which promote success for all participants in the STEM education and careers.

Physics is a collaborative scientific endeavor where the community decides not only what physics is but who physicists are. This community has a set of rituals and traditions that allow those who pass and learn them to be considered a peer. These practices were forged in a fashion that traditionally excluded women, in particular women of color. However, there are women of color who managed to make part of the world of physics, either by learning the rules or breaking them, creating new ones, and contributing  to a new physics. Through storytelling, this work focuses on the trajectory of a Black woman towards the construction of her identity as a physicist and how she became part of this community.

This paper presents themes on the life stories of women of color in physics, astronomy and astrophysics. Drawing from our NSF-sponsored project, Beyond the Double Bind: Women of Color in STEM, we share findings from 10 interviews and 41 extant texts (covering 23 women in varied life stages). Employing interactional theory and narrative analysis, our study contributes a critical analysis of how the intersection of gender and race affects performance, identity, achievement and overall career and education experiences in the physical sciences. Our findings both support the literature on women of color in STEM, as well as bring to light unique issues, such as the importance of outside activism and outreach, and career-life balance issues. This research will add to the knowledge base about strategies for retaining women of color--widely considered an untapped source of domestic talent that could fill the country's scientific workforce needs.

Computational code is a different type of scientific text, where code defining physics quantities and principles is commingled with functions defined by the programming language. In a recent study, physics students were asked to read through computational code and draw a prediction of the visual output produced by short example programs written in VPython. These example programs strategically omit key lines of code representing fundamental physics principles. Student drawings and discussions reveal how students worked together to interpret the lines of code that constrain the motions of 3D objects in the visual output. Student predictions blend together information from the computational code with knowledge about the motion of real-world physical systems. We will present the example program code, some select student data, and the modifications to the instructional task that incorporate these findings.

We present a study of the introduction of Adapted Primary Literature (APL) as part of a high school course on soft matter. APL is a text genre that allows students to comprehend a scientific article, while maintaining the core features of the communication among scientists, thus representing an authentic scientific discourse.  We describe the adaptation of a research paper by Nobel Laureate Paul Flory on phase equilibrium in polymer-solvent systems. The adaptation followed two design strategies: a) Making the interplay between the theory and experimental evidence explicit. b) Re-structuring the text to map the theory onto the students' prior knowledge. Specifically, we map the modeling of polymer-solvent system onto a model for binary mixtures of small molecules that was already studied in class. We then present findings regarding the students' comprehension of the APL and its purpose and discuss their ability to extract features of theoretical modeling embedded in it.

Scientific Inquiry is an introductory undergraduate course for preservice elementary teachers that aims to engage students in authentic scientific practices where these practices are not viewed as a mere course requirement, but are understood as essential practices for constructing knowledge in the discipline. Many of these practices (e.g., representational practices, control-of-variables) evolve over the course of the semester as we work to answer complex questions. However, we hoped to have students- from the start of the term- keep detailed scientific notebooks. In this presentation, we describe an activity designed to foster practices related to the use of scientific notebooks, detail how we use images from scientists' notebooks, discuss the rubrics students create for their own notebooks, and share outcomes, including images of students' notebooks and students' reactions to the activity.

Intersectionality, coined by Kimberle Williams Crenshaw (in law) and pioneered by Patricia Hill Collins (in sociology), posits that minority womens experiences can amount to greater than the sum of racism and sexism (Collins, 1989; Crenshaw, 1989; Wei 1996).  In this symposium, we will present four papers on the application of intersectionality to identity formation for women of color in physics.  Katemari Rosa focuses on the life story of a single woman, as a vehicle for understanding intersectionality in physics identity formation.  Angela Johnson and Heidi Carlone will apply their authoring science identity model to physics, illustrating intersectionality as an analytical tool.  Lily Ko and Maria (Mia) Ong analyzed intersectionality in the lives of 23 women of color in physics and physics-related fields.  Rachel Kachchaf, Apriel Hodari and Lorelle Espinosa discuss how these collective works inform politics and policy in the current STEM-focused education policy context.

How to bridge the dynamics of scientific discoveries with teaching in an introductory physics classroom is a long standing challenge. In chemistry and biology the incorporation of scientific articles in the high school curriculum is a subject of recent inquiry and interest, whose goal is to expose students to authentic scientific processes and facilitate their enculturation into the discipline. However, such scientific texts are hardly ever included as part of introductory physics courses. This session presents examples of how physics instruction can integrate readings of scientific texts at the introductory level. The readings discussed here encompass contemporary research papers adapted to the introductory level, historical lab-notebooks and popular scientific articles of famous scientists, and computational codes. The session and the related discussion aim to scrutinize the instructional affordances of various types of scientific texts, the adaptation and instructional use of each kind, and the learning that takes place.

Physics students are not only taking physics. When examining how students reason with concepts and tools in physics, it is productive to consider their reasoning and experiences with those same concepts and tools in other disciplines. An ongoing interdisciplinary research program is investigating students reasoning about approximation, and the perceived discipline- and context-dependent factors that influence their choice and evaluation of different approximation practices.  Interviewed students reasoned through a number of approximation problems designed to cue experiences from either math or physics.

In this workshop session, participants will collaboratively explore students orientations to Taylor series approximation through video interview data. The session will be grounded in the exploration of the many different ways that student strategies and approximation practices are tied to the disciplinary commitments that they perceive in physics and mathematics contexts, and how those perceptions drive students engagement in and reflection on the practice of approximating, in general.

This workshop concerns analytical and methodological challenges related to studying identity in physics learning. Identity encompasses macro-level categorizations (e.g., gender, ethnicity, academic major, etc.) as well as micro-level dynamics in face-to-face interactions. Here, we use video analysis to explore the intersection of macro/micro notions of identity, as they play out moment-to-moment in physics learning. We will consider the following questions: How do we identify and characterize markers of identity in video data?  How do we bound salient moments where students' identities are influencing their interactions and vice versa?  How do we empirically support claims pertaining to the role of identity in learning?  We will approach these questions through collaborative viewing and analysis of video from classrooms and interviews. We begin with a large group discussion, followed by breakout sessions where participants work in small groups to analyze clips provided by collaborating researchers currently studying issues of identity in physics learning.

This workshop expects to leverage the broad expertise inherent in the PERC community to begin structuring a research agenda which might guide future efforts to support the holistic development of students into practicing physicists.  Participants will brainstorm the following questions in small groups and synthesize the results as a whole group.  Conclusions will be summarized for the community in a proceedings paper.
1) What concepts, habits of mind, skills, and representations thread through the sub-disciplines of upper-division physics?
2) What are the characteristics of curricula that scaffold student acquisition of these concepts, habits of mind, skills, and representations throughout the upper-division?
3) What aspects of institutional culture might facilitate the development, support, and sustainability of these curricula?
4) What models of research are currently available to address the questions above and where are new models needed?

Within learning sciences, tensions sometimes arise between researchers espousing cognitivist versus interactionist perspectives. Broadly speaking, the cognitivist perspective conceptualizes learning as changes in the form and content of knowledge in the head. The interactionist perspective, on the other hand, conceives of learning as a social phenomenon, embodied in the learners talk, action, and interaction with other living participants and materials in a setting. This workshop is aimed toward the goal of seeking reconciliation between the perspectives. We will show two video clips, excerpts from video-taped problem solving done during a (i) clinical interview and a (ii) classroom small-group discussion. During the first half of the workshop, participants will unpack the phenomena observed in the videos. We expect that as a result of this observational emphasis, the participants, to varying degrees, will attend to the content of students knowledge as well as to features in the interaction that become salient to the activity, including affect and situational identity. The second half of the workshop will be used for sharing and synthesizing analysis and comments, and reflecting on whether and how such close analysis of unfolding activity draws on and contributes to both perspectives.

This study seeks to understand how STEM instructors "frame" non-traditional instruction for their students.  Student resistance can undermine both student learning, or a faculty's commitment to non-traditional instruction.  However, little is known about how instructors communicate with students about their pedagogy in order to mitigate such resistance, or what might be the most effective approaches for doing so.  Anecdotal evidenc suggests that many instructors simply tell students what they will be doing and why, and that what works for some instructors may backfire for others (e.g., women).  Based on a national sample of over 20 STEM faculty, we have arrived at a set of 7 generalized approaches for promoting a positive course climate.  We also report on a pilot survey to determine the popularity and perceived efficacy of these approaches.  Future directions will be discussed.  http://www.colorado.edu/sei/fac-resources/

Among the canonical physics core courses taken by most undergraduate majors is a course in mathematical methods.  Physics education research has begun to explore upper division physics courses, as well as the use of mathematics throughout the physics curriculum.  The math methods course is an especially opportune environment to study the development of conceptual understanding of key ideas in mathematics and physics as well as the development of broadly applicable skills and the sociocultural norms of physics.  In this poster we will explore some of what happened in a particular math methods course, with attention to the development of student content understanding as well as the development of community norms.

After learning Newtons 2nd Law, students in a university modeling-based introductory physics class are asked to imagine a box sliding across a floor and slowing to a stop. Although theyve had extensive experience with friction in the context of energy, this is their first exposure to friction within the context of force.  They are asked to make and coordinate different representations for this scenario, including a system schema, and force diagram.  During their small group work, students quickly run into a difficulty:  there are only two interactions with the box (contact, gravitational), so there should only be two forces, yet the box is slowing, which means it must have unbalanced forces in the direction of acceleration.  In this paper, I present evidence from a student-led whole-class discussion (a board meeting) showing how the class uses the System Schema to come to consensus after an initial sharp disagreement between small groups.

To examine the effect of extensive life science applications on student attitudes to learning physics, we analyzed CLASS data from life science students taking introductory physics at Swarthmore. We compare the same students responses from first semester, taught with a standard syllabus, to second semester, taught with extensive life science applications (IPLS). Although first semester responses become less favorable (pre to post), IPLS responses show an increase in favorable and a decrease in unfavorable responses, particularly comparing post-IPLS to post-first semester. This is noteworthy because improvement is rarely observed, even in pedagogically reformed courses. Finally, we analyzed CLASS responses by gender, major, students stated goals in taking physics, and initial interest in physics; initial interest was determined from CLASS items chosen based on the Four-Phase Model of Interest Development. Most notably, we find that in the IPLS course, students identified as having low interest initially had the greatest gains overall.

When we discuss courses designed to be interdisciplinary, such as our course in Introductory Physics for Life Science (IPLS) majors, we often focus on what students can gain from taking a course (physics) outside their chosen discipline (biology). Rarely do we consider what advantages might be gained from students experience with biology in learning physics. At the University of Maryland we have designed an introductory physics course that leverages students biology experiences in an authentic interdisciplinary manner. In this presentation, we will examine case study data of a student who initially describes herself as hating physics. We will look at interview data with her reflecting on her experiences within our yearlong IPLS course. We will explore how her prior experiences as a biology student and as a student in this interdisciplinary classroom came to influence her evolving relationship with physics and the perceived connections between the disciplines.

Chicago State University (CSU) has partnered with two local high school physics teachers to develop a teacher preparation course which provides prospective pre-service students an opportunity to gain authentic physics teaching experience early in their program.  CSUs Teaching Immersion Institute (TII) was developed to guide students through designing, implementing, and reflecting on a lesson given in a local high school physics classroom.  This non-traditional effort fosters a strong partnership between secondary and post-secondary institutions built upon the shared expertise of both the high school and university faculty.     The program  provides students with a meaningful way to determine, early on, if teaching is a possible career option for them and allows the opportunity to educate and mentor future high school physics teachers throughout their pre-service training and challenging induction year.

Human brain mapping methods offer the opportunity to provide biological evidence of student engagement in physics conceptual reasoning and problem solving tasks. We identified brain networks associated with physics problem solving via a quantitative meta-analysis of component cognitive processes such as deductive reasoning, spatial skills, and mathematical calculations. This study assembled functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the BrainMap database [1] and used computational data mining techniques to identify the neural correlates associated with these cognitive processes. The present results were designed to provide groundwork for larger fMRI work in the domain of PER. Ultimately, we aim to use this work as the first phase of a study seeking to identify biological evidence to operationalize engagement, embodied experience, and conceptual metaphor in physics problem solving.

The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS) is a short multiple choice survey that assesses students' attitudes about conducting physics experiments in an instructional setting and in professional research. The survey is given at the beginning and at the end of a course, whereupon students are also asked about what helped to earn a good grade in the course. A variety of aspects of experimentation are explored, including students' sense-making, affect, self-confidence, and the value of collaboration. Over 4000 E-CLASS responses have been gathered from over 30 courses at 17 colleges and universities. We will present a broad overview of our findings, including which student views are the least expert-like, which views shift most over the course of a semester, and which have largest differences between introductory and upper-division courses.

The methodology of using two isomorphic problems focuses on detecting differences in students performance when doing one of the problems. In this article we present a methodology that not only focuses on this, but also analyzes the way that students answers change when doing both problems and the effect in students performance of doing previously the associated problem. We administered isomorphic tests with vector problems to 330 students finishing a mechanics course. We used two set of problems: negative scalar multiplication (no-context and velocity context) and dot product interpretation (no-context and work context). In the first set we detected a significant effect on the no-context problem when students previously did the velocity context problem. In the second set we found that a great proportion of students answered correctly the work context problem but incorrectly the no-context problem. This article presents the methodology so it can be used by other researchers.

Transformative experience (TE) is a theoretical construct intended to capture the extent to which science concepts learned in the classroom shape students everyday meaning-making and engagement with science outside the classroom (Pugh, 2004). One method available to assess the depth and prevalence of TE is surveying.  We have been adapting existing surveys for use in various undergraduate physics courses at two different institutions, including algebra-based introductory physics courses and physical science courses for pre-service elementary teachers. We describe our efforts to modify existing surveys for use across different courses and content areas and describe our initial findings concerning the depth and prevalence of TE. From survey data, large differences can be detected in both the depth of students' overall engagement and the degree to which that engagement falls off when students are not in the classroom or working on required assignments.

Adopting novel curricula is difficult in high schools that have strict pacing criteria and standards set forth by the district for general physics classes.  In order to adapt a PER-based approach to teaching physics, we alternated novel and traditional classroom structures to capture the essence and pedagogy of an innovative curriculum while still maintaining compliance with district policies.  This study investigates how students responded to the alternating implementations of Physics and Everyday Thinkingan innovative curriculum based on the inductive method.  The curriculum involves student-centered investigation, group discussions, collecting and interpreting evidence, and generating inferences and principles from observations.  Findings include students trust in their own investigations and data, students views on working in research groups, and the impact of decentralized authority in the classroom.  These findings and lessons learned from adapting a novel curricular approach in a traditional environment will be discussed.

Flow visualization can contribute strong messages of science content within the community of physics and fluid mechanics researchers, but when communicating outside this community it is the aesthetics of fluid flows that carries the greatest weight. For example, large scale fluid dynamics such as storms, tornadoes, floods and wildfires are often responsible for massive destruction, yet humans draw pleasure from watching such destruction from a safe distance. Can this voyeurism be turned to our advantage in communicating science? This poster will include a short background of aesthetics in an art history context, and then present examples of four aesthetics:  beauty, power, destruction, and oddness. Each aesthetic will be illustrated with examples drawn from flow visualizations from both the Flow Visualization course (MCEN 4151) taught at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and sources on the web.

The PER community has developed and studied many tools designed to increase interactive engagement in physics classrooms (e.g., Peer Instruction, tutorials, collaborative group problem solving, etc.). We present a narrative analysis of using Small White Board Questions (SWBQs) to achieve active engagement. The instructor used a sequence of SWBQs to help the students induce the full Hamiltonian for a hydrogen atom by starting from their knowledge of the Hamiltonian for a 1D particle-in-a-box. We highlight two affordances of this type of sequence: allowing students to build their understanding of a complex system starting from a simple question and providing for increased instructor responsiveness to students' ideas and questions.

Students in our algebra-based introductory physics class explored the concept of center of gravity through a series of embodied activities that engage the sensorimotor system.  Rather than balancing objects on a fulcrum or hanging extended objects to determine the center of gravity, students became part of the experiment by using their finger to apply the force that produces an equal and opposite torque, or by using their finger as a balance point.  A primary goal is to give meaning to the concept of representing an extended object, such as an L or T shape, by a set of discrete points that can be used to determine the objects center of gravity.  Data from a preliminary study that assesses the progression of student learning toward this goal will be presented, as well as some interesting differences in responses for students with differing order of lab and lecture.

The Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE) is a test that was originally developed in English to assess American students understanding of Newtons laws of motion. The present study assesses the Japanese translation of the FMCE (abbreviated as FMCEJ). The data consist of the pretest results of 1095 students, most of whom were first-year students at a mid-level engineering school between 2003 and 2012 in Japan. The basic statistics and the classical test theory indices of the FMCEJ indicate that its reliability and discrimination are adequate in assessing Japanese students views about force and motion. These students understanding of Newtons laws, as assessed with the FMCEJ, is quite similar to that of American students, as assessed with the FMCE. Only a small percentage of the students in the present study are Newtonian thinkers. Minor differences between Japanese and American students are presented.

We describe the design and implementation of an introductory physics Massively Open Online Course (MOOC) offered through Coursera that incorporates computational modeling, peer review, and laboratory exercises. We place special emphasis on the laboratory exercises, which we have designed to resemble the real-world practice of science. In these labs, students capture video of real-world objects with their smartphones. Using this data, they analyze their videos using motion-tracking software and then create predictive computational models of the motion using VPython. Students later compare their computational models to their observations and create video lab reports in which they present their findings and analysis. Assessment of lab reports is done through peer review; students rate their peers video lab reports in terms of the quality of the content and presentation. While developing and implementing this MOOC, we have encountered specific challenges (technical and institutional), which we detail in this paper.

We report on six years of attitudinal data using the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) from traditional and reformed sections of introductory physics at Florida International University.  This work expands upon a previous study that examined Force Concept Inventory (FCI) data and student grades from an overlapping time period (Brewe et al. 2010). In that work, comparisons of FCI gains and student odds of success showed significant differences between traditional lecture and modeling instruction course sections.  Significant effects of gender and ethnicity were also observed.  In the present study, we compare CLASS shifts between course types and disaggregate by gender and ethnicity.  We investigate whether the attitudinal data shows systematic differences along the above factors, with an eye to informing future interventions.

Characterizing faculty expectations is important to produce a comprehensive understanding of what knowledge students should acquire before and during a quantum mechanics course (QMC). We analyzed interviews conducted with faculty and students entering a QMC in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at Georgia State University. The  interviews examine expectations regarding preparation, course material, and instructors goals for a QMC. The goals of the interviews are to locate and conflicts in perspective and to provide students with a map" for areas that will help strengthen the knowledge and skills to be obtained before they enter a QMC. We report on contradictions and similarities in perceptions from interview data determined by coding the interviews and through the use of Activity Theory.

Our research focuses on developing multi-representational tools to assist student understanding of fluids.  The research objective is to reconcile the counterintuitive result students have when applying the Bernoulli Principle to a constricted blood vessel. Students find the pressure decrease with increasing fluid speed to be at odds with their understanding of the resulting pressure increase of a blocked artery. In order to evaluate the apparent paradox generated by Bernoulli's Principle and Hagen-Poiseuilles Principle, students were asked to explain the following three fluid dynamics experiments diagrammatically, graphically, mathematically, and verbally: 
1. A simulated blood vessel constriction. 
2. Flow through a Venturi apparatus and 
3. A free-fall microgravity simulation. 
Pairs of students were interviewed before and after coverage of the content in class. In the post-interview they were given an open-ended question to answer regarding why blood pressure rises when blood vessels are blocked. Preliminary results indicate that hands-on exposure to the tactile demonstrations enables qualitative explanations without relying on mathematical tools.

We use the statistical method of Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to explore patterns in student ideas and attitudes. LCA is an exploratory multivariate analysis similar to cluster analysis that can use student responses to a survey or qualitative binary codes to group students into latent classes. LCA differs from the more commonly used factor analysis because it groups individuals rather than items. Here, we present multiple examples of how LCA can be used to explore questions of interest to Physics Education Researchers. Our first example uses LCA to understand student responses to the Colorado Learning Attitudes towards Science Survey (CLASS), illustrating how to use LCA for quantitative survey responses. Our second example uses LCA to identify patterns in students drawings about day and night cycles, illustrating how LCA can be used to understand patterns in qualitative artifacts.

We reformed a course for future elementary teachers to infuse pedagogical content knowledge into the fabric of a physics course.  The modified course is structured around an instructional model called the pedagogical learning bicycle (PLB) that intertwines the construction of content knowledge (CK) with pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) using metacognitive reflection as a bridge between learning content and pedagogy. To assess the impact of the course experiences on their PCK, the future teachers were asked to work in groups to create lesson plans that incorporated their understanding of elementary childrens ideas of science and strategies to address these ideas.  As a measure of PCK, we scored the lesson plans on the ways in which the students incorporated these ideas in their lesson.  We describe the results of our study and discuss its implications for instruction.

In the reformed physics class at UC Davis, students work through structured activities in small groups where they are encouraged to talk to each other as they reason through and make sense of various physical phenomena. A method for analyzing student discourse to tease out the various approaches that students use in sense-making can help inform the design of small group activities.  This paper reports on the development of a discourse analysis tool that codes the sense-making approaches that students use by monitoring their language and interaction patterns. The code utilizes a lexical-grammatical approach that identifies specific word markers. This approach is grounded in systemic functional linguistics theory. We present an example of this approach by analyzing discourse when students were asked to make sense of various thermal concepts. Assessing student discourse in this way can directly inform the design of small group activities.

Reliable and validated assessments of introductory physics have been instrumental in driving curricular and pedagogical reforms that lead to improved student learning. As part of an effort to systematically improve our sophomore-level Classical Mechanics and Math Methods course (CM) at CU-Boulder, we are developing a tool to assess student learning of CM concepts in the upper division. The Colorado Classical Mechanics/Math Methods Instrument (CCMI) builds on faculty-consensus learning goals and systematic observations of student difficulties. The result is a nine-question open-ended post-test (with two additional, optional questions) that probes student learning in the first half of a two-semester sequence that combines classical mechanics with mathematical methods. In this paper, we describe the design and development of this instrument, its validation, and measurements made in classes at CU Boulder and elsewhere.

The preparation of future learning (PFL) perspective posits that transfer can be measured by how effectively students can learn to solve new problems.  This contrasts with the sequestered problem solving (SPS) perspective which focuses on whether students can solve new problems unaided.  We developed a tutorial to facilitate students understanding and application of mathematical differentiation in physics problems.  One group of students utilized our tutorial, while a control group received a traditional lesson on the same topic.  After instruction, each group completed a SPS transfer task.  Following that they received computer-based hints to aid them on the task.  The extent to which students successfully used these hints assessed their PFL transfer.  We found that students who completed the tutorial did not outperform the control group on the SPS task, but they did outperform them on the PFL transfer task.

The Energy Project is a research effort aimed at increasing learner engagement with energy concepts in K-12 classrooms. We work closely with elementary and secondary science teachers, offering professional development opportunities in which teachers use energy tracking strategies to make sense of energy conservation in a wide range of complex physical phenomena. We value the construction and refinement of flexible, rigorous and intuitive energy models which will empower learners to make sense of phenomena and resources that they care about in the real world.  Therefore, both in instruction and assessment we prioritize energy reasoning strategies over static lists of energy facts or correct explanations.  In this poster we share preliminary evidence of significant shifts in teachers constructive use of diagrams and rigorous attention to energy tracking when confronted with a novel energy scenario.  We believe that this study has methodological implications for future research on shifts in energy understanding.

This paper compares the effect on student understanding from using either real-world circuits or an interactive circuit simulation.  Three groups of students who worked through a tutorial on multiple-loop circuits from Tutorials in Introductory Physics, one with real circuits and two with a simulation, were compared in terms of their conceptual understanding after instruction.  Students who used the simulation completed the tutorial faster and generally scored higher on conceptual questions than did those who used real circuits.  Students who were given additional time with the simulation performed similarly to students who had less exposure to the simulation.

Tutorials in Introductory Physics is a set of instructional materials developed by the Physics Education Group at the University of Washington to improve students conceptual understanding and reasoning abilities. During a Tutorial, students make sophisticated claims and describe their reasoning in short oral and written arguments. We have observed that students may arrive at a scientifically accepted answer, but face difficulties in adequately supporting their claims. Previous research has examined the adequacy of components (following Toulmins argumentation pattern) and the accuracy of scientific content in students arguments. Much of this research focused on scientific arguments related to social issues or long essays in which claims are supported using scientific data. We are extending this analysis to students responses to examination and homework problems. The aim is the identification of common reasoning difficulties and the development of a tool to assess the quality of students short written arguments.

The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) was distributed to members of the Institute of Physics (IOP) in order to measure attitudes and beliefs about learning physics from physics graduates across the UK. We present results from a comparison of the attitudes and beliefs of male and female academics, industry members and people at different levels of academia. Data indicates a statistically significant gender difference between academics responses to statements probing their attitudes towards studying and learning physics. Female academics are seen to have a significantly higher agreement with the expert response to some statements on the CLASS survey than male academics. In addition, female academics show a consistently different response to males in each of the eight survey categories. Preliminary results suggest that the expert view for some statements, as measured by responses from UK academics, may not be in complete agreement with those of US faculty members.

The general education requirements at Southern Connecticut State University have recently been restructured to reflect major shifts in university wide learning goals.   As a result, our large enrollment conceptual physics course for non-science majors has been modified to include a significant laboratory component as well as an increased emphasis on critical thinking, mathematical reasoning and learning about science as a process.  This poster will outline the nature of the course and student population.  We will present pre- and post- instruction results on the Colorado Learning Attitudes About Science Survey (CLASS) highlighting apparent instructor effects indicated by differences in post-instruction results for students in different laboratory sections.  We will also compare CLASS results for sub-populations of students.  Our goal is to help document attitudinal starting points and shifts in attitudes for non-science majors in general and women and minority student populations specifically.

Over the past several years, a curriculum targeting pre-health students and focused on the physics behind biomedical instruments has been in development at Portland State University. Recently, an effort to assess the curriculums impact on students has begun. Given the hands-on focus of the course and positive feedback from students, we hypothesized that it would positively impact their attitudes toward physics and physics learning. We administered the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) in order to cast light on students attitudes. The survey was administered to the summer course and to introductory algebra-based physics courses at the same university. The summer course Physics in Biomedicine produced a small, non-significant shift in student attitudes. This is a promising result, when contrasted with the significant negative shift that is the norm among introductory courses and occurred in our introductory algebra-based physics course.

This research examines how specific tools can serve as boundary objects that mediate contexts in which students feel motivation to engage in physics. In this study I examine student motivations toward physics and the role of tools in reorganizing social practices in the classroom environment and culture--specifically iPads acting as boundary objects, bridging the cultural practices of students' peers, the physics classroom, and the physics community. The act of creating screencasts arises as a central example of how the iPad can be used to generate and share physics knowledge, while allowing students to incorporate references that are meaningful in their peer cultures. The social construct of a boundary object will be elaborated to demonstrate how learning physics is, at its heart, a socio-cultural cognitive task.

Purdue University has the second largest international student enrollment in the country, which translated to nearly 40% self-reported international students in our Fall 2012 calculus-based introductory mechanics course. Surprising, both international and domestic populations have 25% female students. Contrary to expectations, preliminary examination of student exams scores show that the international female students were the highest performing students in our introductory calculus-based mechanics course.  An obvious conclusion is that the international female population are simply better prepared for the course, except that analysis of pre-test results of the Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning show no difference between the populations. In this poster we present a further investigation of these results.

Acquiring research skills and developing an identity as a scientist are critical to the development of young physicists but often neglected in undergraduate physics courses. While some students develop these traits "on the job" as undergraduate researchers, many leave the physics major before experiencing what being a scientist is all about. To counteract this trend, the Berkeley Compass Project offers a freshman course called "Introduction to Modeling" that emphasizes the actual practice of science. In it, students engage in model-building through guided activities related to the ray model of light. They then use the skills acquired to conduct research projects guided by graduate student advisors and culminating in papers and a poster session. The students also reflect on their "scientific identities" through a series of readings, discussions, and self-evaluations. In this presentation, we discuss the methods and activities used in this course and the positive outcomes experienced by our students.

Research has demonstrated that attentional cues overlaid on diagrams and animations can help students attend to the relevant areas and facilitate problem solving. In this study we investigate the influence of visual cues and correctness feedback on students reasoning as they solve conceptual physics problems containing a diagram. The participants (N=90) were enrolled in an algebra-based physics course and were individually interviewed. During each interview students solved four problem sets each containing an initial problem, six isomorphic training problems, and a transfer problem. The cued conditions saw visual cues on the training problems, and the feedback conditions were told if their responses (answer and explanation) were correct or incorrect. We found that visual cues and correctness feedback significantly improves students abilities to solve the training and transfer problems. Supported by NSF grants 1138697 and 0841414.

The PER community has developed materials that build on students' conceptual and epistemological resources.  However, little attention has been given to students' technological resources, which are becoming increasingly important.  As "digital natives" make up the majority of our student population, a simple change of replacing paper and pencil lab notebooks with digital notebooks may have a dramatic impact on the extent to which students feel valued and respected.  Additionally, digital notebooks are more aligned with the way digital natives have learned to do their work.  Initial results suggest that digital lab notebooks lead to increased student achievement, engagement, and quality of work.  Survey results revealed that students preferred digital notebooks because they allow for "easier data sharing" and increased "versatility."  These results will be discussed along with implications for instruction and further research.

The ability to effectively communicate scientific content to non-expert audiences is important to physicists and the public-at-large. Drawing on both observations of and literature about expert practitioners, we present a framework for the assessment of basic scientific communication models and skills of physicists communicating with non-expert audiences. This framework accounts for different epistemological frames that are activated when experts communicate with experts and with non-experts, and it provides a mechanism to distinguish the models of communication that are engaged in by participants. To demonstrate the utility of this framework, we analyze videos of university physics students explaining physics concepts in both a lecture-style format and in an afterschool setting with middle school children. Using these data, we characterize the physics students scientific communication skills and inferred models of communication.  Among the findings, we can associate communication frames (deficit, dialogue, participation) to pedagogical frames  (transmission, constructivist) along the dimension of participant-centeredness.

In the participationist perspective, learning is viewed in terms of how students transform their participation. However, many of the seminal papers discussing the participationist framework are vague on specific details about what student participation really looks like. As part of a larger project to understand the role of student participation in learning, we are trying to characterize the ways in which physics students participate in group activities and discussions while they are constructing new knowledge. The context for our study is a student-centered introductory calculus-based physics class structured around the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) philosophy. In this poster we will discuss some of the patterns we have found and some of the methodological challenges we have encountered in trying to code and quantify student participation.

Computer modules developed at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities use cognitive apprenticeship to coach the decision-making process required to develop a problem solving framework.  As such, there exists a potential to apply the modules towards additional learning environments, e.g. a pre-college environment.  Four high school in-service instructors from the central Arkansas area were interviewed in a case study analysis to discuss whether they believed a subset of coaches modified for algebra-based physics would meet expectations of student performance or augment student preparation for university-level physics courses.  The instructors collectively have teaching experience that includes 9th-grade physical science, pre-AP upper-level physics courses, and AP Physics B and C courses.  Audio-visual recordings and written artifacts serve to inform future development for the benefit of high school physics classrooms, both in terms of preparing students for university-level physics education, and in terms of professional development for pre-service and in-service teachers.

We describe a veteran high school Physics Modeling teacher's semester-long reform effort to implement pedagogical changes, which were informed by her students' participation in the Cogenerative Mediation Process for Learning Environments (CMPLE).  Our analyses of classroom video and teacher interviews from this instrumental case study indicate the teacher used CMPLE to transform her pedagogy by expanding her practice to encompass her students learning preferences, as well as her own teaching beliefs, observations, and reflections.  CMPLE is a formative intervention designed to help students and instructors collaborate to improve classroom dynamics, and centers upon participants attempts to match their collective environment with their learning preferences.  Participants use cogenerative dialogues to produce achievable goals, in order to guide those attempts.  For this poster, we focus on the pedagogical changes related to the cogenerative goal of teacher-led examples before practice.

Inquiry activities can provide students with the chance to experiment and to externalize their reasoning. To examine the impacts of level of guidance in inquiry-based activities on students mechanistic reasoning, we analyze middle school students scientific notebooks from an afterschool program by applying a coding scheme that is modified from Russ (Russ, R. et al.. (2008). Sci. Ed., 92: 499525.). We compare students mechanistic reasoning in two inquiry physics curricula, one that is very guided and another that is more open-ended inquiry. We find that students exhibit more types and more overall mechanistic reasoning in the open curriculum. We also code the curricula and find that students have more opportunities to practice mechanistic reasoning in the open-ended curriculum. We examine why students take the opportunities provided to them in both curricula and the implications for both informal and formal curriculum design.

Faculty from science education and faculty from English (Composition & Literacy) collaborate in an upper-division science class for future teachers. We use a range of practices to support students engagement with science writing. We pay particular attention to multimodal composinginformal science notebooks, diagrams on whiteboards, images shared on Tumblrto model and reflect the composing practices of scientists.
 
We offer evidence that 1) students engage in a rich, iterative process of constructing, critiquing and refining models and terminology in ways characteristic of scientific practice, and 2) students multimodal compositions play a central role in the construction of these models. Of particular importance are structures that allow, and encourage, the use of students own language for composing (Sommers, 1982; Brannon & Knoblauch, 1982; Straub, 1996). Without the rigid, and often template-driven, lab report as a model, students make meaning in ways that resemble the real work of scientists.

Computational thinking is a key practice of science education, one rarely integrated into instruction in an authentic way.  A second key practice, creating models of physical phenomenon (e.g., momentum and acceleration), has been recognized as an important strategy for facilitating students' deeper understandings of both science concepts and the practices of science. We are creating an interdisciplinary computational thinking curriculum for grades 4-6 that identifies opportunities to combine development of computational thinking and programming skills with content in other disciplines such as science, math, and social studies.  Here we present an example project that can be used to iteratively develop a model that represents the momentum and acceleration of an object that align with physical observations, coupled with increasingly sophisticated computational thinking concepts to implement those models.  In addition, we present initial findings on students' perceptions of computation prior to formal instruction.

Research has demonstrated that well-designed games can effectively scaffold student learning (Clark, Nelson, Sengupta, & DAngelo, 2009). However, games for learning, especially in the domain of physics, have barely explored how the process of conceptual change occurs during game play; rather the emphasis has been on showing the effectiveness of games by showing pre-post gains (Anderson & Barnett, 2011; Barab et al., 2009). This study investigates the process of knowledge construction in students as they play a digital game based on Newtonian mechanics by using the microgenetic method (Siegler & Crowley, 1991). Grounded in the knowledge in pieces perspective (Clark, et al., 2009; diSessa, 1993; Hammer, 1996), we identify conceptual resources that are activated during each level of game play and analyze how these resources get reorganized toward more expert-like thinking about the relevant physics concepts as students progress in their game play.

The religious beliefs and personal values of students may affect their epistemologies. At our faith-based institution, we are encouraged to incorporate faith integration into all courses. We have used this as an opportunity to incorporate daily discussions on epistemological issues into introductory physics classes, intended to elucidate character traits that are beneficial to scientists and to compare and contrast scientific epistemology with the religious beliefs of the majority of our students. We present data gathered with the EBAPS survey from courses with and without this intervention.

Kinetic Theory and Bernoullis Principle are fundamental concepts life science students can use to explain a variety of important biological phenomena. We are using a series of simple experiments to help pinpoint student learning gaps in fluid dynamics based on paired student interviews. Students were asked to use multiple representations (diagrams, graphs, math and written descriptions) to explain the following pre and post lab activities: 
1. Pre: An "empty" sealed balloon expanding inside a glass jar being evacuated. Post: an air filled balloon cooled in liquid nitrogen.
2. Pre: A dented ping-pong ball expanding upon heating when in contact with boiling water. Post: Lit candle in a jar sealed with water.
3. Pre and post: A manometer liquid level changing due to air flowing away from an open end. 
The interviews suggest that understanding Bernoulli's Principle requires a solid conceptual understanding of kinetic theory, in particular equating pressure with particle collisions. A "modeling centered" ideal gas law lab has been developed using semi-quantitative diagrammatic tools that we propose will help to improve student understanding of Bernoulli's Principle.

Content knowledge for teaching is the specialized content knowledge that teachers use in practice  the content knowledge that serves them for tasks of teaching such as making sense of students ideas, anticipating conceptual challenges students will face, selecting instructional tasks, and assessing student work. We examine a middle-school physical science teachers interactions with a group of students for evidence of content knowledge for teaching energy (CKT-E). Our aims are to develop our theory of CKT-E as well as criteria for its observational assessment. We identify CKT-E as potentially including elements of consensus energy models, elements of alternative energy models, elements of a sophisticated understanding of the nature of science, and a repertoire of instructional tasks or activities that exemplify or support instructional goals.

As part of an ongoing investigation of students learning in upper-division quantum mechanics, we need a high-quality conceptually focused assessment instrument. Such instruments can also be useful for comparing outcomes of different curricular approaches.   We started by building upon an existing 14 item open-ended Quantum Mechanics Assessment Test (QMAT).  However, open-ended tests require complex scoring rubrics, are difficult to score consistently, and demand substantial investment of faculty time to grade. By converting QMAT to multiple-choice format, we have begun the process of constructing a 30 item concept inventory for upper division quantum topics.  Here, we present elements of the development process, including analysis from a preliminary study conducted at Cal Poly Pomona and CU-Boulder. We are investigating test reliability using classical test theory, as well as using student interviews to further establish validity of the multiple-choice format.

Play theory offers a potent and rich paradigm to appropriately incorporate the affective domain in the design of a course. Until recently the focus of assessment in course design has been pre-instruction and post-instruction. But the core motivation of play is the organization of experience. And so one of the key tenets of play theory is the essential need to continually evaluate the experience. Play theory also provides valuable insight in characterizing and evaluating affective properties of active learners such as exploratory learning, curiosity, and risk-taking and their role in curricular design. The pedagogical properties of an inclusive learning environment will be presented and evaluated through the play theory paradigm.

A year-long program was developed to train middle school teachers in a large Ohio district to create high quality common formative assessments (CFAs).  An iterative process was established whereby teams of teachers drafted CFAs in various subjects, and then pre and post-tested their students.  The teachers were trained to analyze the data collected to determine the quality of the test questions, resulting in improvements to the CFA.  Here we present an overview of the program with evidence showing the improvements teachers made in test design and analysis.

When education researchers describe newly developed curricular materials, they typically concentrate on the research base behind their design, and the efficacy of the final products, but do not highlight the actual process by which the materials were created.  With the aim of providing potentially useful information for faculty engaged in similar projects, we describe here our development of a set of in-class tutorials for advanced undergraduate electrodynamics students, and discuss factors that influenced their initial design, validation, and implementation.  Among these considerations were: addressing faculty-consensus learning goals, observing and attending to common student difficulties, and devising ways for students to engage in meaningful activities on advanced-level topics within the time frame of a single 50-minute class period.  Based on student and instructor feedback, we found the most popular implementation style to be tutorials broken into 10-15 minute stages, punctuated by class-wide discussions.

Quantitative skills and mathematical reasoning are considered central to
introductory physics. Increasingly, physics is seen as a place where students
can begin to develop skills that are critical for modern biology such as using
mathematical representations to organize conceptual understanding, reasoning
about parametric dependence and limiting cases, understanding the implications
of units as dimensions, and making and justifying quantitative estimations.
In our introductory physics course for life science majors our aim is to help
students see the relevance and utility of mathematical reasoning. We do so
by explicitly integrating biology examples into the course and by emphasizing
how math can be used to deepen understanding. In this poster we present an
analysis of student reactions to math in this course and discuss the challenges
and opportunities of developing biologically relevant mathematical competence in
introductory physics.

We report on the development and evaluation of Learning Physics (LEP), a new curriculum adapted from Physics and Everyday Thinking (PET). PET is an inquiry-based, hands-on, physical science curriculum that was developed for small enrollment discussion/lab settings. The Learning Physics (LEP) curriculum maintains the same research-based learning principles as PET but is suitable for classes taught in lecture format. LEP incorporates both videos of experiments and hands-on activities that students can perform on small desks typical of lecture settings. LEP also incorporates assignments where students submit written work and evaluate each other using a web-based system. This paper describes the curriculum, and presents LEP students' content performance and views about science. Outcomes are compared to students in courses using PET.

In the Learning Assistant (LA) Program at Seattle Pacific University, novice teachers perspective of student ideas expanded to include viewing these ideas as sensible and as productive starting places for instruction.  Our research suggests plausible mechanisms that foster this expanded view.  We propose that articulating teaching values that prioritize student reasoning, searching for kernels of correctness in student thinking, and negotiating curricular knowledge promote this particular attention towards student ideas.  We use evidence from the LAs' teaching reflections to illustrate a causal link between the shift and the mechanisms we pose.

The ability to accurately estimate physical quantities is an invaluable skill for scientists and engineers. The development of estimation skills has become an explicit learning goal in the first-year physics course for engineering students at UBC. In order to establish a baseline and look for possible gains in skill level, we have developed a 10-question multiple-choice assessment designed to probe student ability and confidence in estimating physical quantities such as mass, size, and time. Student interviews were used to establish question validity and open-ended written versions were used to seed multiple-choice responses. The diagnostic was administered as a pre-test and post-test and given to a set of experts to establish its discriminatory power. The results showed a statistically significant difference between students and experts, but no overall student gains. This poster will give an analysis of the results and share some observations based on student interviews.

Anton Lawson's Revised Test of Scientific Reasoning consists of 12 paired multiple-choice items that have students answer questions in the first part and justify their responses in the second. Lawson himself noted that purely pencil-and-paper methods of testing reasoning may put some subjects at a disadvantage due to their reading and writing skills. Purdue University has one of the nation's largest freshmen-level, calculus-based physics courses and one of the highest international student enrollment rates which provides a unique opportunity to test this concern for native versus non-native English speakers. During the Fall 2012 semester, we administered the Test of Scientific Reasoning with matched pre/post tests for 378 self-reported native speakers and 211 self-reported non-native speakers. Analysis of these results uncovered multiple differences between these populations as well as other issues with the Lawson instrument itself.

We as physics educators are reluctant to believe that our students are too stupid to learn physics and devote time to develop ingenious forms of teaching to make it possible for everyone to litterally see the the light the way we do. What does it take to become a physicist, and can anybody make it? To investigate this question, I have conducted surveys on students of  introductory physics at Dalarna University.

The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS), was used to probe the students attitudes about physics and its learning. In addition, Lawsons Classroom test of Scientific reasoning skills (LCTSR), which measures the maturity of scientific resoning skills in students was used.

The results show a statistically significant correlation between the total score on LCTSR and the degree to which the responses on CLASS agree with those of professional physicists.

Sensemaking during an experiment, such as reflecting and evaluating, is entwined with issues of affect. For example, students may weigh the relative importance of taking in-class time to reflect on activities versus leaving the class early. These decisions often reflect a distinction between their epistemological framing of doing a lab and doing science. This study examines how students reflect during an experiment that involves two common systematic errors. While many students reflected on their results and found the source of the larger systematic errors, very few did so for the smaller one. In fact, for the latter case, many students retroactively increased their initial uncertainties to compensate for the final discrepancy, effectively hiding the systematic inaccuracy altogether. We use these results, in-class observations, and post-lab interviews to propose new classroom practices to shift students framing in the lab towards doing science and away from doing a lab.

Providing students opportunities to prepare and use their own equation sheets during testing is one of the open resources policies used in physics tests.  Some education researchers argue such policy as potential threat in degrading expert problem-solving behavior, whereas others disagree.  Over the last two years, I tried both polices in various physics classes in which some student cohorts used their self-created equation sheets  while others used instructor-created equation sheets. In order to understand the nature of students equation sheets, I collected and examined them. A problem-solving rubric was used to analyze the problem solutions.  A comparative study will be presented on students performance as well as on the problem solutions produced by different student cohorts. This study revealed variation of students equation sheets from those of experts. Quality and quantity of the information contained in the equation sheets indicated a trend predicting students problem-solving performance and strategies.

This study explores both students ability to make valid inferences from data tables and the effect of students prior beliefs on that ability.  Over 300 introductory physics students participated in one of two conditions.  In both conditions, the data filling the tables was identical; however, in the first condition, the tables were presented within a familiar physical context, well-known to elicit incorrect prior beliefs in many students.  In the second, the tables were presented in a generic context. We found that students in the familiar physical context condition were significantly more likely to draw invalid conclusions than students in the generic context condition. Closer analysis revealed that, when provided with a physical context, students tended to look at the data less, relying in part on their prior knowledge to draw their conclusions.  Interestingly, students in the physical context condition indicated a higher confidence in their responses, despite their lower accuracy.

Research has shown that student choice and flexibility in the learning environment are linked to motivation and agency. This education research investigates the effect of choice and flexibility in impacting homework completion rate.  Two different classroom treatments were applied over two terms of an urban high school chemistry course. The first treatment involved flexible, supportive classroom structures that theoretically would lead to a greater homework completion rate. The second treatment (or control) involved the traditional, authoritative structures that had been in place--students were penalized for not completing homework within the designated timeframe.  Initial results suggest that the flexible supportive structures led to greater homework completion rates and to higher performances on the district assessment over the non-flexible homework condition.  These results will be discussed along with instructional implications, explanatory conjectures, and lessons learned.

We examined the effects of simple training tasks on student responses to questions about the relationship between the directions of net force, velocity, and acceleration.  Six training conditions were constructed, including in a 2x2 design (abstract vs. concrete contexts) x (acceleration-velocity training vs. force-velocity training), a force-acceleration training condition, and a control (no training) condition.  We found that the acceleration-velocity and force-velocity training significantly improved scores on both of these question types but negatively affected scores on force-acceleration questions, which is inconsistent with hierarchies of student understanding of force and motion found in previous works.  We also found that the force-acceleration training led to slightly lower scores than control, which also breaks the hierarchies and evolution of understanding previously observed. Overall, this implies that students are "gaming" the simple training tasks and not learning the multiple relations between the variables that is typically learned in the course of standard instruction.

Studies have shown that embedding scientific argumentation in problem solving can enhance problem solving skills.  However, research has also indicated that students have difficulties constructing arguments without appropriate scaffolds.  We investigated the use of argumentation scaffolds on students argumentation quality, conceptual quality, and solution strategies on conceptual problems in an introductory physics class.  In this mixed method study we compared students performance in two guided conditions -- constructing an argument and evaluating two arguments --  as well as one control condition.  Our results indicate that the use of guiding prompts improves the argumentation and conceptual quality of students solutions.  Further, students in the guided conditions tended to use more sophisticated problem solving strategies than in the control condition.  We discuss the implications of these results on the use of argumentation prompts on conceptual problems in introductory physics.

The focal point of this study was to investigate differences in problem-solving performance between three different introductory physics course formats at Florida International University. The course formats-- lecture+laboratory (LL), inquiry based (IQB), and lecture+laboratory+recitation (LLR)--all incorporated two Advanced Placement (AP) questions into their final exams. Students written responses were evaluated via an AP scoring rubric, and during this scoring, we observed qualitative differences in solution behavior between the three course formats. To further investigate these differences, we used the framework of epistemic games [1,2]  to analyze student responses. To apply this framework to written work, an epistemic game rubric was created. This rubric yielded game profiles for each of the course formats, allowing us to highlight and compare course characteristics. These profiles of game distributions were then examined via chi-squared tests to quantify differences in the tools and strategies students used in their solutions.

Purdue Universitys IMPACT  program facilitates the transformation of large enrollment courses by incorporating interactive engagement methods in to the course. As participants in this program, the researchers reformed Purdues Fall 2012 introductory calculus-based mechanics course, Phys 172: Modern Mechanics, by developing a series of Multimedia Learning Modules (MLMs) for use with the Matter and Interaction text .  In addition, the one-hour weekly recitations were redesigned to enhance students problem solving skills by utilizing cooperative group problem solving.  Finally, the two-hour weekly labs were partially redesigned to enhance students computational modeling skills.  To evaluate the effectiveness of this reformed course, data analysis included student pre-test/ post-test results from Lawsons Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning, Primary Trait Analysis of student exams and student responses to an anonymous survey.

Assessing student performance becomes challenging when course enrollment becomes very large (~10^5 students). As part of an introductory physics Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) offered via Coursera in summer 2013, students submit video reports on force and motion labs.

This paper describes the methods developed and used to guide students in evaluating each others' video lab report. Results from peer evaluations are also discussed.

For solving problems, especially ill-structured ones, a solver must employ metacognitive strategies including self-monitoring to be successful.  Solvers who frequently examine their thinking are able to assess their progress, consider alternatives and evaluate their own work.  In several lower division science, technology, engineering and mathematics courses, students were given class assignments where they were asked to record problem solutions using a think-aloud protocol.  These solutions were recorded using Livescribe smartpens, which record and synchronize pen strokes and audio to create a "pencast."  To better understand the self-monitoring process, as well as improve future versions of the class activities, we examined the recorded think alouds after the courses and identified five categories of self-monitoring. We will present examples from each of these categories as well as instructional suggestions for increasing the amount of student self-monitoring in problem solutions.

Upper-division laboratory courses on electronics, particularly analog electronics, are typically required for all physics majors and often serve as a gateway to advanced laboratory courses and undergraduate research experiences in experimental physics.  Given the integral role such electronics courses play in undergraduate physics programs, very little research has been conducted on the extent to which specific learning goals are met in these courses.  An ongoing, multi-institutional research effort in such upper-division electronics courses has recently revealed persistent student difficulties with foundational circuits concepts (e.g., Kirchhoffs junction rule) as well as canonical topics in analog electronics (e.g., op-amp circuits).  In the past year, we have extended this investigation to examine student understanding of basic bipolar-junction transistor circuits.  Several specific difficulties have been identified, and examples from interviews and student responses to written questions will be used to provide insight into such difficulties.

Instructors of reformed courses face many potential barriers to change. One possible barrier is students reactions to differences between the reformed and traditional courses. We used an expectancy violation framework to explore students experiences in second semester calculus-based introductory physics courses, taught either in a traditional lecture and laboratory mode or in a studio mode that closely modeled SCALE-UP. In this pilot study, we adapted the Pedagogical Expectancy Violation Assessment (PEVA) to include questions about course satisfaction. At the end of the semester, students were asked to report on their initial expectations for the course and what they experienced in the course, as well as their satisfaction with specific experiences and the course overall. We present preliminary results about differences between students reported expectations and experiences in the traditional and studio courses, as well as the effect of the format of their first semester introductory physics course, gender and ethnicity.

Pedagogical content knowledge has been a useful construct for conceptualizing the knowledge-base that supports reform teaching practices. In physics education, we are still far from having established methods and instruments for assessing such knowledge. In an attempt to begin exploring possibilities for assessing instructor knowledge of student thinking, we asked a small sample of college physics instructors to take the Force Concept Inventory in two novel ways. Instructors were first asked to indicate the answer that they think a typical novice student would choose prior to instruction and then to estimate the fraction of students answering correctly after instruction. We analyze how instructor responses compare with actual student data and discuss questions with significant mismatch-either ones that instructors overwhelming succeeded (or failed) at identifying student difficulties or questions where instructors were overwhelmingly pessimistic (or optimistic) about student performance. Implications for future work in this area of assessment are discussed.

The Force Concept Inventory (FCI) has been widely used to assess student understanding of introductory mechanics concepts by a variety of educators and physics education researchers. One reason for this extensive use is that many of the items on the FCI have strong distractor choices that correspond to students alternate conceptions in mechanics. Instruction  is unlikely to be effective if instructors do not know the common alternate conceptions of introductory physics students and explicitly take into account students initial knowledge state in their instructional design. We used the FCI to evaluate the pedagogical content knowledge of both instructors and Teaching Assistants (TAs) of varying teaching experience. For each item on the FCI, the instructors and TAs were asked to identify which incorrect answer choice they believed would be most commonly selected by introductory physics students. We used the FCI pre-test and post-test data from a large population (~900) of introductory physics students to assess the pedagogical content knowledge of these educators.

Several schools have implemented "Learning Assistant" (LA) programs, in which upperclass undergraduates serve as teaching assistants in introductory courses. At UNCG, LAs are given an unusual degree of freedom. Working in teams, they serve as the primary instructors for lab sections of the two introductory calculus-based physics courses. They co-design the lab curriculum with the professor of the lecture section, conduct all lab classes, and grade all student work. In order to investigate how students taking the lab reacted to having undergraduates as lab instructors, we gave and analyzed a short anonymous Likert-type survey probing students' opinions at the end of the second course. We found that overall, most students reacted favorably. They found the LAs' content knowledge and pedagogic skills to be adequate, and saw some benefit to having undergraduates rather than faculty to interact with. They also believed that the LAs' instructional style matched the professor's.

UNCG has an innovative Learning Assistant (LA) program, in which upper-class undergraduate physics students teach laboratory sections of the introductory calculus-based physics sequence. These LAs run the lab sections, generally without faculty present; as well as write up handouts for the labs, quizzes and other documents; and evaluate students work. The LAs meet with the professor before the semester to determine an overall plan for the lab course. Weekly meetings continue throughout the semester to review the previous lab and prepare for the upcoming lab. This gives the LAs a genuine voice in the design of the course. The program provides LAs with an authentic teaching experience. Through interviews with former and current LAs we found that this experience makes students more inclined towards a career in teaching, or even PER. It has also improved students content knowledge, experimental and laboratory writing skills.

Multiple representations are important for learning physics concepts and solving problems (e.g. interpreting text, equations, pictures, diagrams, and/or graphs), yet students often struggle to make sense of these representations. This study investigates how introductory students and graduate students view and interpret motion graphs. Participants viewed several graphs of position, velocity, or acceleration on a computer screen and were asked to match a region of the graph with a description of the objects motion. We compare performance on the questions with audio-recorded explanations and eye movements recorded using an eye tracker.

The application of factor analysis to the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) has proven to be problematic.  Some studies have suggested that factor analysis of test results does serve as a helpful tool in assessing the recognition of Newtonian concepts by students.  Other work has produced at best ambiguous results.  Our results show that factor analysis of pre-test data produces no factors that can easily be identified with introductory physics concepts.  However, analysis of post-test results shows that student responses have changed to the extent that factor analysis reveals five factors that can be associated with specific physics concepts.

The distinction between physics concept and mathematical formalism often seems arbitrary to the physicist. As one faculty colleague put it, "the concepts are the math and the math are the concepts." We interpret faculty lectures in the context of frames, defined by Tannen as the contextual surrounding of communication.  But where "normal" dialogue requires both parties to agree to the particular frame, the unidirectional nature of lecture can result in an important mismatch between faculty and student expectation, particularly about the underlying reasons behind a mathematical manipulation.  In this work we link classroom frame with symbolic forms, a structure proposed to explain how physicists embed conceptual meaning in mathematics. These forms reveal a multi-faceted view of equations and derivations, with simple mathematical operations resulting in profound shifts in meaning. We find faculty using these to move seamlessly between frames, switching, for example, between the conceptual and mathematical. These changes in frame can be explicit, as is the case with a deliberate re-writing of an equation, or implicit, and, as a consequence, students may not detect a frame change and therefore answer inappropriately or erroneously. These analyses lead discussion of pedagogy in a new direction, one that strikes at the heart of what it means to understand a mathematical representation.

Physics education research (PER) has been making progress in providing research-based instructional techniques and tools to help assess the complex learning goals associated with a mature understanding of physics. We conducted semi-structured interviews with faculty members and students entering a quantum mechanics course (QMC) in the Physics & Astronomy Department of Georgia State University. The interviews examine perspectives on what types of evaluation are most appropriate for an upper-division course. The types of evaluation discussed are multiple choice questions, short answer questions, traditional written problems, student presentations, and one-on-one oral exams. A post-course survey was offered to the students that took the QMC  that semester and those who completed the course in recent history. We present the data associated with multiple choice questions and oral exams.

The overall goals of physics instruction are not gains on concept inventories or improved scores on surveys of epistemological beliefs.  While these measures provide evidence of science learning, they are proxies for the broader goal of developing scientifically literate citizens and scientists who draw on their physics knowledge outside of classroom settings. These momentsexperiences in which students actively use science concepts to see and experience their everyday world in meaningful, new ways has been termed transformative experiences (TE) (Pugh, 2004).  As part of a broader effort to measure TE and understand features that support TE in physics, we report on a comparison between two classrooms, one with high TE and one with low TE, and propose possible classroom features that generate high measures of TE in physics.

The proper handling of data and its uncertainty is often an implicit learning outcome for many undergraduate physics labs. As educators, our ultimate goal is to have students be able to transfer all that we teach to novel situations. Our approach to teaching many of the basic statistical treatments of data involves the use of invention activities: designed to engage the students; intended to stimulate creative thinking; particularly brief and highly structured; and, meant to precede both explicit instruction and reinforcing practice. Such activities have been shown as useful support for the formation of an initial orderly schema (i.e., preparation for future learning). This poster will present the invention activity we use to teach how and when to calculate a weighted average, as well as evidence to support that our students are spontaneously transferring some of this knowledge to near-in-context but far-in-time problems.

Using factor analysis we investigated the career outcome expectations of a large sample of college students. From the fifteen items analyzed we extracted eight factors covering over 50% of the total data variance. Upon factor identification we found that while some factors are general, others are gender specific. Among the latter ones, the communal values factor is associated with female gender and life sciences career interest, and negatively associated with engineering career interest. Also, the innovator factor is associated with male gender and interest in physical sciences and engineering careers. Another factor strongly associated with male gender is career as means to social recognition. These results are in line with existing research pointing to different goals for males and females when choosing careers, females being more oriented toward communal behavior and connection with real life, while males are more attracted by social recognition and power.

While experts prefer to solve problems symbolically, many introductory students strongly prefer to solve problem using numbers.  While symbolic problems have many advantages, there is a good deal of overhead to learn before a student becomes proficient enough to recognize those advantages.  A series of paired numeric/symbolic questions were designed to highlight the advantages of symbolic problem solving.  This poster will describe those questions and the results of some pilot testing interviews.

The work presenting would like to improve the attitudes of the students to physics in general and especially on electromagnetic induction. Attitude word would mean not only interest, also relevance of the physics learnt in relation with the everyday life and connection between concepts and equations.

It was designed a sequence of activities for teaching electromagnetic induction in introductory university physics courses. The teaching learning sequence is based in research, taking into account students difficulties and problem solving strategies. There are activities specially designed to work the science-technology-society relations at the beginning and end of the sequence. The aim of the first activities is to show the presence of the electromagnetic induction in the everyday life and in technological applications. At the end of the sequence the students return to these activities and they have to explain how it works. 

Attitudes will be measured using a Likert scale questionnaire.

We present results from the first year of ongoing research to better understand how writing an undergraduate thesis improves critical thinking and writing skills through impacting metacognition, motivation and beliefs. In previous work, we have demonstrated that students studying biology who participate in a thesis-writing course alongside independent research not only develop better writing skillsexpected, perhapsbut also exhibit stronger scientific reasoning skills than students working one-on-one with faculty. Students enrolled in the writing course achieved highest honors at graduation at almost triple the rate of other thesis writers. These results are in keeping with the notion that writing can be an effective strategy for promoting positive learning outcomes, but here we strive to understand how writing actually affects learning. Data have been collected across multiple departments and institutions. Ultimately, our analysis will be used to motivate institution- and department-specific changes during subsequent years of this multi-year study.

Previously, we presented implicit scaffolding as a framework underlying the design of PhET simulations. We have refined this framework, and here consider its use to support student agency and ownership over learning experiences. While traditional forms of scaffolding employ explicit prompts, questions, or instructions to guide student learning, implicit scaffolding provides scaffolding through affordances, constraints, feedback, and cues designed into learning tools. Implicit scaffolding guides without students feeling guided. With appropriately designed learning tools, the amount of explicit guidance can be reduced, leading to positive affective results. We observe students asking scientific questions, creating experiments to answer those questions, and often finding satisfaction and joy in figuring things out. We present evidence of students productively exploring and enjoying the experience of learning with sims that incorporate implicit scaffolding.

Many physics curricula include a focus on students' use of evidence to develop physics ideas. Our curriculum development efforts have explored how to include a focus on using evidence to develop ideas in a large, lecture format course. In this paper, we compare two approaches: (1) showing students videos of experiments and/or screencasts of simulations, and (2) having students perform experiments and/or work with simulations themselves. We compare the features and limitations of each approach, and describe best practices for effective use of hands-on activities in lecture-settings. We provide examples of students' engagement in science practices during hands-on activities, and report on students' perception of the two approaches.

This poster will describe how an observational study of a piece of educational technology in the classroom led to the curriculum development.Interactive Whiteboards have become widely used in the last decade. Most studies of the IWB use are fairly general and there is still a great need for studies addressing effective IWB use for teaching specific subjects, including physics. In an observational study, that also included interviews with teachers in a Slovenian high school, we have investigated how the IWB were being used in physics classrooms. Patterns found by the researchers to be effective and the approaches recognized as useful by the teachers were used to design lessons. In those lessons IWB was used in combination with dynamic interaction software (Algodoo). The interactive surface, which gives the IWB an advantage over a standard computer-projector setting, makes possible a creative graphical and even kinesthetic input from the students.

One goal of education is to help students  become well-rounded citizens who can think broadly across disciplinary boundaries. In addition, individuals with interdisciplinary thinking skills can be valuable contributors to modern research challenges by understanding and recognizing interdisciplinary connections and working in diverse teams. However, there is little research on the connection between interdisciplinary thinking and physics  education. What aspects of physics classroom practices and experiences foster interdisciplinary thinking? What effect does interdisciplinary thinking have on the development of students physics identities? Using a physics identity theoretical framework with data from a national survey , this study investigates the connection between characteristics of interdisciplinary thinking and physics identity. Also, we examine how high school physics classroom and student characteristics are related to  interdisciplinary thinking.

For introductory life science students, fluid dynamics is a topic that is important, relevant to biology, and yet difficult to understand conceptually. Our study focuses on probing understanding of pressure differentials and friction which underpin ideas of viscosity and fluid flow. Data was collected from think-aloud/demonstration interviews and was analyzed using the resource framework to look for productive student reasoning such as a microscopic viewpoint and gradient driven flow.  We investigated if a multiple-scale view of matter is useful for students when constructing a model of viscosity and will present both our model and feedback from students who have worked through it.

Quantum mechanics is challenging even for advanced undergraduate and graduate students. Dirac notation is a convenient notation used extensively in quantum mechanics. We explore the difficulties that the advanced undergraduate and graduate students have with Dirac notation. We administered free response and multiple-choice questions to students to investigate the difficulties. We also interviewed some students individually using a think aloud protocol to obtain a better understanding of the rationale behind their responses. We find that many students struggle with Dirac notation and are not consistent in using this notation correctly. In particular, their correct and incorrect answers to questions involving Dirac notation are context dependent. We will discuss some findings. Supported by the National Science Foundation

Quantum mechanics is challenging even for advanced undergraduate and graduate students. In the Schrodinger representation, the wave function evolves in time according to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The time-dependence of the wave function gives rise to time-dependence of the expectation value of observables. We explore the difficulties that advanced undergraduate and graduate students have with time-dependence of expectation values in quantum mechanics. We administered free response and multiple-choice questions to students to investigate the difficulties. We also interviewed some students individually using a think aloud protocol to obtain a better understanding of the rationale behind their responses. We find that many students struggle with time-dependence of expectation values of observables that do not have explicit time-dependence. We will discuss our findings.

Because of the challenges of recruiting students into science teaching and because of the complex nature of the teaching profession,  we have taken an approach to preparing the next generation of science teachers that involves input from a diverse set of local communities.  Through the APS PhysTEC and the NSF Noyce Program we have strengthened our collaborations with Two Year Colleges and inservice teachers in the area and have co-designed activities and experiences with these communities  that build on their specific strengths and experiences.  Specifically, we have created two types of early teaching experiences that involve local schools and have created a Learning Assistant (LA) Program that involves three of the Two Year Colleges in Chicago.   We describe how these new collaborations  provide students with diverse experiences in the teaching of science to students who plan to teach in the urban school district.

The Colorado Upper-division Electrostatics (CUE) diagnostic was designed as an open-ended assessment in order to capture elements of student reasoning in upper-division electrostatics.  The diagnostic has been given for many semesters at multiple universities resulting in an extensive database of CUE responses.  To increase the scalability of the assessment, we used this database along with research on students difficulties to create a multiple-choice version.  The new version explores the viability of a novel test format where students select multiple responses and can receive partial credit based on the accuracy and consistency of their selections.  This format was selected with the goal of preserving insights afforded by the open-ended format while exploiting the logistical advantages of a multiple-choice assessment.  Here, we present examples of the questions and scoring of the multiple-choice CUE as well as initial analysis of item difficulty, discrimination, and overall consistency with the open-ended version.

Learners everyday ideas about energy often involve energy being used up or wasted. In physics, the concept of energy degradation can connect those ideas to the principle of energy conservation. Learners spontaneous discussions about aspects of energy degradation motivated us to introduce new learning goals into our K-12 teacher professional development courses.  One of our goals is for teachers to recognize that since energy degradation is associated with the movement of some quantity towards equilibrium, the identification of energy as degraded or free depends on the choice of the objects involved. Another goal is for teachers to recognize that overall energy degradation occurs. We find that teachers discussions contain productive ideas about energy degradation that demonstrate progress towards our goals. These include (1) the idea that degraded energy can be made useful and (2) the idea that making energy useful requires either effort or energy relocation.

In the fall of 2012, the West Virginia University Learning Assistants (LA) program was expanded to include the second semester calculus-based physics course. This poster reports changes in attitudes (measured with the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey) in data collected after the implementation compared to baseline data collected during the pre-LA semesters of 2011. We show the modified course has improved pre-post attitude changes in some categories, which extends to female and first-generation students. We explore the significance of and suggest reasons for these differences. (This project is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. EPS-1003907.)

The Colorado Learning Assistant (LA) Model has demonstrated that it is successful in helping to meet multiple goals including enhancing student learning in LA-supported courses, increasing conceptual understanding of physics among LAs, and improving the teaching practices of former LAs in K-12 schools. The research reported here investigated the experiences of first-time physics LAs taking into account the goals of the program and the learning philosophies implicit in the design of the LA experience. Analysis of interviews with LAs and LAs written reflections, demonstrated a common theme across LAs concerning the importance of student/teacher relationships in learning. The LAs views on relationships focus on issues of teacher approachability and authority. Inferences are made about the critical aspects of the LA model related to LAs learning. Suggestions are also made concerning possible improvements to the LA experience based on this analysis of LAs learning.

Is it possible to tell -- just by watching student groups in a classroom -- the kinds of discussions they are having? Is information about students' activities reliably expressed in visual observables like gestures, posture, and facial expressions?

In our Physics for Biologists course at the University of Maryland, we are attempting to build interdisciplinary bridges that help students understand thermodynamics better.  One aspect of this endeavor involves having students grapple with the physical processes underlying heuristics that they bring to our course from their biology and chemistry classes.  In particular, we have implemented a series of activities and problems intended to unpack the hydrophobicity of oil, a key step in understanding the formation of cell membranes.  Student reasoning about this process illustrates the challenges and affordances of trying to bridge physics and biochemistry curricula.  Understanding the spontaneous separation of oil and water requires careful consideration of the sometimes competing effects of energy and entropy.  Reconciling disciplinary distinctions in how these ideas are described is an important step in helping our students develop more coherent thermodynamics concepts.

We have been investigating the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) since 2005 so that we may better understand what the FCI tells us about our teaching.  In 2012 we turned to think-aloud student interviews on a subset of questions.  Doing so showed us that the difficulties they had with some questions had nothing to do with their understanding of physics.  These difficulties involved diagrams, notations, and vocabulary that make perfect sense to physics teachers but can easily confuse beginning students.   Based on these interviews, we attempted to clarify some of the FCI questions and then conducted more think-aloud sessions.  After two iterations, the third set of interviews revealed student difficulties which clearly centered on the physics.  Here we focus on two particular conceptual difficulties that arose consistently - confusing force and momentum and isolating events in time.

In this contributed paper we describe an NSF-funded project in which a room-sized mixed reality simulation was designed to develop middle school students intuitions and understandings for how objects move in space. The simulation environment, called MEteor, uses laser-based motion tracking and both floor- and wall-projected imagery to encourage students to use their bodies to enact the trajectory of an asteroid as it travels in the vicinity of planets and their gravitational forces. By embedding students within a physics simulation and offering representational supports designed to connect body-based intuitions with abstract concepts and principles, the intent is to engage students in physics education at both a physical and affective level.  One of the desired outcomes is to improve students interest and feelings of efficacy towards physics and science in general, and in this paper we describe data collected from over a hundred participants that address these outcomes.

This research investigates students explanation of real-life phenomena after performing discovery-based physics experiments. In this presentation, we will document the categories of explanations that students use in making sense of situations requiring them to apply concepts in mechanics and heat. Our preliminary results show that most students do not readily transfer the target content knowledge to a transfer context even though the learning and transfer contexts have the same structure.

We have previously reported examples of student failures to conceptually combine Boltzmann factors with the density of states appropriately in thermal physics. Our earlier analyses focused on specific student difficulties observed directly from the data; e.g., students successfully describe ideas related to either the Boltzmann factor or the density of states, but do not often articulate the simultaneous effects of both, as required by the physical context. We now extend our findings by analyzing student data through multiple theoretical lenses, such as a resources perspective and the framework of conceptual blending, among others. Employing these perspectives illuminates valuable features of the data previously unavailable to us.

Much recent work in physics education research has focused on ontological metaphors for energy, particularly the substance ontology and its pedagogical affordances.  The concept of negative energy problematizes the substance ontology for energy, but in many instructional settings, the specific difficulties around negative energy are outweighed by the general advantages of the substance ontology.  However, we claim that our interdisciplinary setting (a physics class that builds deep connections to biology and chemistry) leads to a different set of considerations and conclusions.   In a course designed to draw interdisciplinary connections, the centrality of chemical bond energy in biology necessitates foregrounding negative energy from the beginning.  We argue that the emphasis on negative energy requires a combination of substance and location ontologies.  The location ontology enables energies both above and below zero. We present preliminary student data that illustrate difficulties in reasoning about negative energy, and the affordances of the location metaphor.

A lock-in amplifier is a powerful and versatile instrument which is used frequently in condensed matter physics research. However, many students struggle with the basics of a lock-in amplifier and they have difficulty in interpreting the data obtained with this device in diverse applications. To improve students' understanding, we are developing an "On-Ramp" tutorial based on physics education research which makes use of a computer simulation of a lock-in amplifier. During the development of the tutorial we interviewed several faculty members and graduate students. The tutorial is based on a field-tested approach in which students realize their difficulties after predicting the outcome of experiments that use a lock-in amplifier; students can check their predictions using simulations. The tutorial then guides students toward a coherent understanding of the basics of a lock-in amplifier. In this talk the development and assessment process will be discussed.

The Institute of Physics New Quantum Curriculum (quantumphysics.iop.org) consists of online texts and interactive simulations with accompanying activities for an introductory course in quantum mechanics starting from two-level systems. We describe methods used to optimize the simulations and activities in terms of clarity, ease-of-use, promoting exploration, sense-making and linking of multiple representations. During observation sessions, students were asked to think aloud while exploring simulations and working on the associated activities and then respond to follow-up survey questions. Responses and feedback were also gathered from students at two institutions where a small number of simulations were incorporated into assigned homework or used during classroom workshops. We describe general principles for the design of simulations and activities found as outcomes of this work which we have incorporated wherever applicable. These include intuitive controls and on-demand text in the simulations and making explicit links between mathematical and physical representations in simulations and activities.

The PhET interactive simulations are well-known resources that originated in physics and are now used in many science disciplines. This is the first of several planned case studies of widely-used educational innovations to characterize the strategies used by PIs to popularize their innovation. We collected multiple sources of data, including interviews with the original developers, relevant publications, and documents released by the PhET team over the years. We analyzed the interview data and documents using a predetermined lens and constructed a narrative of key events and strategies. We found the PhET team had clear goals from a very early point in the development stage. The product was refined and solidified after a period of pilot testing, and additional funding prompted each new phase of propagation. The results of this work may help future PIs design a propagation plan for their innovation.

Massive Open Online Courses provide an exciting new avenue for instruction and research. In the Spring of 2013, MITx released its first introductory physics MOOC through the edX platform, generating a total enrollment of greater than 40,000 students from around the world. We describe course participants in terms of their age, gender, level of education, and country of origin, categorizing these demographics into appropriate subpopulations. Using the three midterms and final exam as reference points, we contrast the performance of different demographic groups, and present a comparison of the gender gap and attrition between MOOCs and traditional classrooms. Our work represents a preliminary analysis aimed at understanding MOOC data and its context within physics education research.

We use Conceptual Blending and the Resources Framework to analyze two pervasive metaphors used in mathematics in physics contexts: Fictive Motion and Animation of the Inanimate. Fictive motion occurs when a function "gets small as you get far away".  Animation of the Inanimate occurs when properties of living creatures -- such as death or growth -- are ascribed to mathematical functions.  We show how these two theories explain and interpret these two pervasive metaphors in a fine-grained way using resource graphs and a multi-space blending table; we additionally discuss emergent meanings using the theories in concert.  Our data are drawn from video-based classroom observations of physics faculty and upper-division students.

At Florida International University (FIU), our Learning Assistant (LA) program is a component of our secondary teacher preparation program.  All of our pre-service secondary teachers participate in the LA program because we believe that it provides LAs with opportunities to foster tools that will help them to develop expertise in teaching.  To understand physics LAs views in regard to expertise in teaching, we interviewed twelve former and present physics LAs.  Semi-structured interviews were analyzed using open coding followed by selective coding.  Results of this analysis revealed varying perspectives on expertise in teaching.  These perspectives indicate that these physics LAs views on expertise are moving toward an understanding of the role of pedagogical content knowledge in expert physics teaching.

English Language Learners (ELLs) are frequently left on the periphery of classroom interactions. Due to limited language skills, teachers and peers communicate with these students less often, decreasing the number of opportunities to engage. Exclusion can be avoided with learning activities that invite all students to participate and contribute their thinking. We argue that environments and activities that privilege scientific inductive reasoning increase possibilities for emerging bilingual students to engage. This study investigated first-grade students' discussions about factors that affect how objects float. Students came from a variety of language backgrounds; all were considered beginner/intermediate ELLs. Results show that the goal of inducing principles from actual phenomena encouraged students to communicate their ideas and reasoning, boosting students' confidence in expressing themselves. Following the hybrid space argument of Vygotsky's theory of concept formation, we see how external expression could lead to internalization of science concepts, and to develop English language skills.

While physics education research is appropriately attending to issues surrounding the fundamental role that affect plays in cognition, such research should not be dislocated from the subject matter it refers to. Legitimation Code Theory (LCT) is a sociological toolkit for the study of knowledge as well as the knower, the latter being the most commonly studied in educational research. In an effort to turn the focus to knowledge, the LCT concept of semantics is used to examine the context dependency of thermodynamics knowledge as depicted in N=133 first year physics student responses. The concept of Semantics is one way to describe the organizing principles of knowledge and to do so helps to reveal the different properties, powers and effects that different types of knowledge afford. The issue of affect will be discussed in this context, as will the implications for the teaching and learning of thermodynamics, and PER in general.

The ability of Juniors in Physics at Oregon State University to solve for the magnetic vector potential of a spinning ring of charge is analyzed using Sayre and Wittmanns (2008) model of resource plasticity. None of the 17 students, working in groups of two or three, was able to solve the problem in the given time. Those students who used geometric reasoning to connect to something they solidly understood did not accept incorrect answers and knew they had not yet achieved a solution, whereas many other students were willing to connect their answers to more tenuously understood plastic resources and their answers contained errors. We discuss these results and their instructional implications concerning the degree to which students are encouraged to connect to solid resources as they solve problems, compared to being encouraged to consider connection to plastic resources as being good enough.

eTALK and MyTech are projects aimed at improving the traditional laboratory class experience.  Measurements are made by utilizing the students laptops, smartphones, and tablets in place of the traditional, unfamiliar data probes.  eTALK focuses on using laptops and small equipment kits to facilitate high-quality lab experiments without the need for dedicated laboratory rooms.  Coupled with electronic communication and monitoring by teaching assistants, this allows for a completely portable or long-distance laboratory course without sacrificing an advantage of in-person classes, the synchronous instruction.  MyTech focuses on using the advanced capabilities of smartphones and simple, intuitive applications to allow students to collect data in laboratory exercises with devices they carry at all times.  eTALK and MyTech offer opportunities to improve student engagement and interest by using students own devices, and to reduce equipment and labor costs as well as demand for laboratory space, while maintaining traditional laboratory standards.

Scientific reasoning skills have recently re-entered the spotlight as the new framework for science standards came into being. At the tertiary level, reasoning skills such as hypothesis generation and evidence evaluation are equally deemed as a central learning goal in introductory science courses. Presumably, as students learn more content-oriented domain knowledge, their reasoning skills are expected to increase correspondingly. Prior cognitive and educational research has also predominantly supported this view of mutually corroborative relationship between content learning and reasoning skills. Drawing on this basis, this paper empirically investigates the influence of content learning on the development of college students scientific reasoning skills. Students from four grade levels (grades 13-16), representing individuals exposed to different amount of content learning, took the Lawsons Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning (LCTSR). Cross-grade comparisons show little progression in student reasoning skills measured by the LCTSR. Implications of the current study for higher education are discussed.

Responsive teaching, or the application of responsive listening, is the extent to which teachers attempt to understand students ideas and respond to those ideas in moment-to-moment interactions. We propose that responsiveness does not only apply to teacher-student interactions, but responsive listening can also be found at the peer level. In a professional development course for K-12 teachers, we analyzed a small group discussion about energy usefulness and identified responsive listening among peers. We observed that learners engaged with each others ideas and further inquired about the reasoning behind those ideas. We claim that responsive listening promoted productive disciplinary engagement which resulted in the refinement of their understanding about energy.

Understanding cooperative behavior in interacting multi-particle systems is at the heart of research in materials of interest to physics, chemistry and biology. We developed a program that supports introductory-level students in understanding how the balance of interactions and entropy results in equilibrium structures that are neither completely ordered nor completely disordered in a wide variety of soft matter systems (e.g., colloids, polymers, surfactants). Analysis of students' use of thermodynamics principles to understand phase separation, highlights students' difficulties in constructing a concrete representation of the relevant thermo-statistical concepts. 
To address these problems we are developing a suite of computational modeling tools with a strong visual component.  In the context of the commonly used lattice gas model, students can explore the consequences of random motion, observe the dynamics of the approach to equilibrium, monitor bulk properties of the system, and observe how spontaneous formation of structures is tuned by various inter-particle interactions.

This research will investigate the potential difference in performance on the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) based on modifying the wording of various question prompts. The FCI was administered during Spring Term 2013 at Oregon State University (OSU) in a total of six lecture sections (with approximately 180 students per section) of introductory physics with calculus at Oregon State University, with half the students taking the unaltered FCI, and the other half taking a modified version edited to attend to student affect. Six categories of modifications were made, including changing the audience of the questions and adding encouraging statements, consistent with the Idea Space cognitive model developed by Allie and Demaree. This model builds on work by Julian Taylor, Phil Southey, and Victoria Nwosu at the University of Cape Town.  It also builds on findings from Jennifer Roth at OSU on the relation between question prompting and framing on student engagement.

Electrodynamics is a fundamental subject in physics, but in the words of Prof. Steinn Sigurdsson of Penn State University, Electromagnetism is Severus Snape. You must master E&M, but so many have irrational fear or hatred of it. It leads to deep unification and glimpses of fundamental symmetries, and is strangely beautiful yet powerful. (Physical theories made magical, APS News, vol. 17, no. 8, p. 4, 2008). The combination of two features: students having to learn many key concepts, as well as to master the use of mathematical techniques in order to understand the applications, makes this course challenging both for the student and the instructor. In the Physics Education Research community, a lot of attention has been paid to the improvement of delivery of introductory Physics courses and high-school Physics courses (see the numerous articles in Physical Review Supplement: Physics Education Research or the Physics Teacher). But teaching upper-level courses to a student group that is becoming increasing inhomogeneous is a distinct challenge that hasnt been addressed very much. Inspired by the work of Stephanie Chasteen, et.al., "Upper Division Transformations in Physics", STEM Education Symposium, Univ. of Colorado, August 31, 2009 poster, I have re-developed the upper-level electrodynamics course. The interventions used were: linking assessment to learning goals of the course, increasing student engagement via active learning, scaffolding for problem-solving, reducing lecture segments to 20minutes. Student achievement has improved significantly  the average of final exam scores (closed book exam with all new questions every year) has increased by almost 15%, and the average class grade has gone from C+/B- to a high B+.

While introductory electricity and magnetism (E&M) has been investigated for decades, research at the upper-division is relatively new. University of Colorado has developed the Colorado Upper-Division Electrostatics (CUE) Diagnostic to test students' understanding of the content of the first semester of an upper-division E&M course. While the CUE covers many learning goals in an appropriate manner, we believe the rubric for the CUE is particularly aligned to the topics and methods of teaching at the University of Colorado. We suggest that changes to the rubric would allow for better assessment of a wider range of teaching schemes. As an example, we highlight one problem from the CUE involving the superposition principle. Using data from both Oregon State University and the University of Colorado, we discuss the limitations of the current rubric, propose a revised rubric, compare results using the two rubrics, and discuss the implications for assessing students understanding.

Being able to read and interpret scientific texts is an essential scientific ability for our students. One method that has been developed to enhance students' ability to read texts is a question-based reading strategy, the interrogation method. Students read a section of the text and then use the information found in the section to answer the question "Why is this sentence true?" for a paraphrased sentence from that section. Critical to the efficacy of this method is the selection of productive sentences for students to interrogate. Sentences that are highly interrogatable require students to reason through the text and connect concepts in order to completely respond to the prompt. We have explored the use of this method in an introductory physics course. This poster will discuss the framework we have developed for choosing productive sentences that are both highly interrogatable and have a high epistemological value.

After introducing several new elements into an introductory mechanics course at Loyola Marymount University, we observed a substantial reduction in the gender gap on the FCI.  The course used the Thinking in Physics curriculum, an interactive engagement pedagogy aimed at developing general thinking and problem solving skills along with an understanding of physics.  The new elements were designed to reduce stereotype threat and to improve the experience of female students.  They included giving students a self-affirmation writing exercise created by researchers at the University of Colorado and interviewing students at the beginning of the course.

A pilot study was undertaken in the spring 2013 semester that introduced reflection on problem solving in the laboratory section of a second-semester algebra-based introductory physics course.  The course population typically consists primarily of biology majors, some of whom are pre-medical, and physical therapy majors. 37 students in two laboratory sections were asked to reflect on the solution one selected homework question each week during the beginning of the laboratory period.  Available diagnostics include pre- and post-test MPEX data, statistics and recorded artifacts of the students homework and reflection attempts, and responses to a brief questionnaire about the usefulness of the reflection exercise at the end of the semester.  Data analysis explores different aspects of attitudes towards physics represented in the courses student population; plans for a future study will be guided with respect to these findings.

In 2012-2013, the UMd PERG and Biophysics Program implemented a new laboratory curriculum for its introductory physics for biologists course in a pair of small test classes.  These labs address physical issues at biological scales using microscopy, image and video analysis, electrophoresis, and spectroscopy in an open, non-protocol-driven environment.  We have collected a wealth of data (surveys, video analysis, etc.) that enables us to get a sense of the students responses to this new approach.  In this poster, we will give a brief overview of what we have learned.  (This work is part of the UMd PERG NEXUS/Physics and is supported by funding from HHMI and the NSF.)

This poster describes the analysis of video recordings of physics experts solving novel problems involving solar cells, which involved such advanced physics topics as complex circuits and semiconductors.  By performing a fine grained analysis using a resource based model of cognition, we determined what resources experts use while reasoning in the current context and how they used them.  By analyzing critical events in the problem solving process, we searched for meaningful patterns of resource activation to help gain insight into expert problem solving processes.  We present the results and compare then with similar studies involving novices

With the growing push to include computational modeling in the physics classroom, we are faced with the need to better understand students' computational modeling practices. While existing research on programming comprehension explores how both novices and experts generate programming algorithms, little of this discusses how domain content knowledge can influence students' programming practices. Resource Theory does provide a means for addressing the interaction between content knowledge and programming practices. I will present a framework for extending Resource Theory to describe students' computational modeling practices.

For over a century, physicists and physics educators have attempted to transform physics education to engage students in scientific induction. These efforts have largely failed to bring about evidence-based, inductive reasoning on a broad scale. This study investigates the role of nontraditional evaluative structures in promoting authentic scientific reasoning among students, as contrasted with more commonly observed failure-avoidance behaviors, in two physics classes. Prominent evaluative structures in this context consisted of (1) individual and small group reconciliation of students ideas and explanations with available laboratory evidence and (2) whole class consensus building of explanations that can best explain the evidence collected. Findings suggest that the relocation of evaluative authority of students ideas and explanations to laboratory evidence and social consensus, rather than with teacher and text, can promote more authentic engagement, enjoyment, and a sense of identification with physics.

We designed an instructional unit discussing the physics of solar cells as part of an investigation into students use of cognitive resources.  This study resulted in a body of written and verbal data which we analyzed and examined for evidence of resource activation.  The analysis gives insight into how students build understanding of a complex physics topic, and guidance for how to revise the unit.  We present examples of resource activation in the data, outline the changes we made to the unit based on this data, and present results demonstrating the effectiveness of the changes.

This research explores the hypothesis that curricula designed around evidence-based inductive reasoning, such as Physics and Everyday Thinking, can level the playing field for linguistically diverse students.  Specifically, we evaluate how linguistically diverse learners and native English speakers perform on conceptual physics assessments and the extent that students use models and evidence to justify claims and ideas.  Results indicate that within this learning context, female students from linguistically diverse backgrounds demonstrate comparable performance on post-course assessments of conceptual understanding and the use of models and evidence.  However, we did not observe the same results from male students from linguistically diverse backgrounds.  We will discuss these differences and propose rationale for aspects of the learning environment that may have led to these findings.

Self-efficacy, the belief in ones ability to succeed in the task at hand, has been reported to support students in overcoming challenges inherent in learning physics. Traditionally self efficacy is measured by pre-post course surveys.  However, these measures do not reveal how efficacy is experienced in the course and provide little detail informing the causes of shifts in self-efficacy. In-the-moment data on student affective experience, including self-efficacy,  was collected to complement pre-post surveys. Students in an introductory calculus based physics course had increases in self-efficacy (d = 0.5, p < 0.01) as measured by pre-post surveys. Yet, in-the-moment measures indicated that students had lower experiences of self-efficacy in this physics course than in all other STEM courses. These results imply that investigating how students reflect on their physics learning experiences is necessary for understanding how to improve students physics self-efficacy.

While developing a standardized fluids assessment covering buoyancy and pressure, we discovered deficiencies in student understanding of density.  In particular, many college students do not recognize that density is a fixed property of a solid substance, such as aluminum or gold.  We added questions to our diagnostic exam to probe the extent of student difficulties.  In one of our questions, only 50-60% of students recognize that the density of gold is a fixed value.  When similar questions from an existing diagnostic1 are used, however, 85-90% of students correctly identify the density of a piece of wood and of a diamond as fixed values.  In this paper we discuss the differences between these questions and how those differences affect student responses.

Undergraduate physics students commonly collaborate with one another on homework assignments, especially in more challenging courses. However, it is not well known if the types of collaboration students engage in affect their performances.  We empirically investigate collaborative networks and associated performances through a required collaboration reporting system in two sophomore level and three junior level courses during the 2012-2013 academic year. We employ social network analysis to quantify the structure and time evolution of these networks, which involve approximately 140 students. Analysis includes analytical and numerical assignments in addition to exam scores.  We discuss results from this analysis.

Students were asked to draw all the forces on both an accelerating car and on a passenger riding in that car. Then they were asked to identify why the car accelerated. As it turns out, these are hard questions. Students cannot always think of the correct forces. In those cases, if they are motivated to make Newton's second law work, they might invent forces, or label things as forces that are not actually forces (i.e. "motion," "momentum," "inertia"). In other cases, the labeled forces are all interactions between two objects, but students cannot then use Newton's second law do explain why things accelerate. This presentation will examine the conditions under which students make these choices. In addition, student performance on the Force Concept Inventory, particularly the items about the nature of forces and about Newtons Second law, relates to their performance on the free-response problem in an intriguing way.

During a sequence of interventions including a tutorial and a teaching interview, a student (Bryce) showed evidence of understanding all the steps of Riemann-sum style reasoning about why displacement corresponds to the area under a velocity vs. time graph, which in turn corresponds to the integral of velocity over time.  However, he does not view this reasoning as productive for explaining to someone why displacement corresponds to that area under the velocity vs. time curve. We argue that his view stems not primarily from conceptual or mathematical difficulties but from his epistemological stance toward learning integration. Although Bryce tries to mesh physical/conceptual reasoning and other pieces of mathematical formalism (such as simple equations), he views integration as something to be accepted and used.  He therefore frames the Riemann sum reasoning as unneeded logical stepping stones rather than as a deeper explanation linking mathematical formalism to intuitive physical ideas.

The Physics Education Group at the University of Washington is examining student understanding of blackbody radiation.  Results from interviews and questions administered in sophomore and upper-division courses indicate that traditional instruction on blackbody radiation often does not help students apply the concepts and mathematical formalism to real-world objects.  We are developing an online homework that approaches blackbody radiation from a phenomenological viewpoint, rather than from an idealized formalism.  Initial use suggests that this homework helps students understand, for example, how the spectrum of an incandescent light bulb changes with temperature.  Moreover, students who have worked through the homework also seem able to provide more robust answers during interviews than students who have not.  However, we find that students continue to struggle with the concept of blackbody radiation. Additional research is needed to be able to design more effective instructional materials.

Here initial data is presented from an on-going study to classify student abilities to infer graphed variables relationships. The information presented here focuses on categorizing where students have difficulty. Understanding why certain presentations and relations are more difficult is a future goal. A small but persistent difference in student ability to read trends in graphs with only two data points in comparison to graphs with five data points has been found. In addition, large differences have been found in student ability to use graphs showing that the variables have no relation, a horizontal line, or an unknown relationship, a vertical line, vs. more standard graphs where the data is showing either a proportional or an inverse relationship. Lastly, there seems to be small differences in student ability to predict hypothetical values of data outside a graphed region compared to their ability to analyze the trend (proportional, inverse, none, or unknown).

Recent research suggests that many students complete an undergraduate course on quantum mechanics without having developed a solid understanding of some important fundamental concepts.  We are probing the ability of students to apply foundational ideas in quantum mechanics in a variety of contexts, including the complex problem of time-dependent perturbation theory.  Based on student responses to lecture posttests, tutorial pretests and posttests, as well as individual student interviews, we are identifying persistent difficulties that students have in applying basic ideas about energy measurement and the time evolution of energy eigenstates and superpositions of energy eigenstates.  The results are guiding the creation and revision of tutorials on topics students typically encounter the second half of their undergraduate instruction on quantum mechanics.

Students in introductory physics courses sometimes struggle to correctly break down a single vector into its components when provided only with an arrow, a magnitude, a reference angle, and a coordinate system. Students struggle further when asked to break down a vector in an inclined coordinate system, such as the weight vector of a box on an inclined plane. Varying the placement of the angle consistently affects student error and response patterns across four physics student populations: algebra-based mechanics, algebra-based E&M, calculus-based mechanics, and calculus-based E&M. This suggests that student difficulties with trigonometric vector components are persistent and pervasive, even across different introductory physics courses, and are far below the requisite near-perfect accuracy needed for such fundamental skills. Student error and response patterns are discussed for both problem types.

We closely analyze the actions of one undergraduate quantum mechanics student in an oral exam situation with two related problems. Both problems involved the visualization of a 3-d structure to represent the real and imaginary parts of the wave function on one spatial coordinate. Instruction before the exam included several in-class activities involving building 3-d representations of wave functions for several potentials using pipe cleaners. Though the oral exam did not specify that students should or should not use pipe cleaners, the student in this analysis brought and used them during the exam. We analyze the students interaction with the pipe cleaners and varying degree of success from the point of view of material anchors for conceptual blends, including how the varying success may be accounted for in terms of the pipe cleaners variable functionality.

PeerWise, an online tool that facilitates peer learning through student-generated content in the form of multiple-choice questions, was implemented in a large introductory physics course in a research-intensive UK university.  Students use of PeerWise was found to correlate with their performance in the end-of-course examination, even after taking into account their ability as measured by assessment prior to the start of the course. Interactions between students engaged in PeerWise activities included answering, rating and commenting on questions posed by their peers. These connections were investigated using social network analysis. Preliminary results show that a relatively equitable network was formed among the cohort, opening up the possibility of an extended network of peer support providing opportunities for students to deepen their own understanding and evaluative skills.

We describe the implementation of using student-generated content as part of the summative assessment component of a large, introductory physics course for non-majors taught at UBC. Using the PeerWise online tool, students were required, on two separate occasions during the semester-long course, to individually author one original assessment question (and associated explanation), together with community participation to answer 5 questions of their peers, and rate and comment on three further questions. As in previous implementation of PeerWise that have yielded a surprisingly high quality of student contribution, we provided extensive and on-going scaffolding and support as to how to author questions of high quality through the course tutorials. We describe patterns of engagement, student views of using the system and a preliminary assessment of question and explanation quality, by evaluating and categorizing a sample of submitted questions.

Students enter introductory physics courses with a variety of mental models about how the world works. These include pre-existing models about the nature of light and ideas about how different colors of light mix. 120 students enrolled in introductory physics filled out questionnaires before and after instruction about the nature of light and color mixing and explained why they answered the way that they did. We found that before instruction, students used either a model consistent with pigment mixing or a hybrid model to describe both the processes of pigment mixing and light mixing. Only students in the group whose instruction included explicit instruction on how the eye sensed color exhibited a changed mental model during the post-instruction questionnaire. We concluded that only instructional methods that demonstrate how the eye senses color have an impact in assisting students to develop mental models that are consistent with actual physical processes.

This is a continuation of a set of work investigating how students use mathematics when solving physics problems.  This phase of the study specifically looked at qualitative data from in-depth group interviews to expand upon the more quantitative studies previously conducted.   Specifically, but unsurprisingly, the results indicate that students tend to focus on problem structure when dissecting math problems but focus on context when dissecting physics problems.   This is evident in a variety of tasks including grouping/matching exercises and oral discussions of the nature of the problems.  Excerpts from these interviews along with an overall analysis will be presented here, as well as some indication for future work to facilitate a more natural and useful integration of these disciplines for effective problem solving.

Quantum states are traditionally cognitively managed exclusively with algebra rather than geometry. One reason for emphasizing algebra is the high dimensionality of quantum mathematical systems; even spin-1/2 systems require a 2-d complex number space for describing their quantum states, which can be hard to visualize. Using nested phasor diagrams, which use nesting to increase the dimensionality of graphic space, we taught undergraduate students to represent spin-1/2 states graphically as well as algebraically. In oral exams, students were asked to identify which spin-1/2 states, expressed numerically, would generate the same set of probabilities as each other (i.e., they are the same except for a different overall phase factor). Video records of oral exams show that no students (N=13) performed this task successfully using an algebraic method; instead, all students solved the problem graphically. Furthermore, every student who succeeded used a certain gesture to solve the problem.

Modeling, the practice of developing, testing, and refining models of physical systems, has gained support as a key scientific practice in the K-12 Next Generation Science Standards, and in curricula such as Modeling Instruction, RealTime Physics, ISLE, and Matter & Interaction. However, modeling has gained less traction at the upper-division undergraduate level. As part of a larger effort to transform upper-division physics labs to incorporate scientific practices, including modeling, we conducted a series of think-aloud experimental activities using simple electronic and optical components in order to investigate how students use modeling with minimal explicit prompting in a laboratory setting. We review general patterns in students' use of models, describe our coding scheme, and conclude with a discussion of implications for the design of modeling-focused lab activities and lab-appropriate assessments.

This study presents students� opinion on the use of a graphing calculator in a calculus course that is based on physics contexts and it is taught in a student-centered learning environment. In this calculus course, the classroom setting, the designed activities, and the use of technology aim for the improvement of students understanding of mathematics through active learning by fostering communities of learning. In this study, 65 students enrolled in a first-year calculus course responded a questionnaire on the use of the calculator to support their learning.
As results, students indicated a positive attitude towards the learning of mathematics and considered the graphing calculator as a very useful learning tool. 
In conclusion, the graphing calculator activities fostered students' learning and promoted a positive perspective as learners of mathematics. The strategic use of technology empowers them to enhance their mathematical knowledge and help them to make connections with other subject areas.

As part of an ongoing study into upper-level physics students' identity development, we present a case study of a group of three students working in a traditional junior-level Advanced Lab course.  The data collected for this analysis include video-based observations of students working together in the lab, working in different groups in a prior Modern Physics lab course, and individual interviews with each student. We identify authentic scientific practices that students enact in the lab and use discourse-analytic techniques to compare their actual practices with their expectations for appropriate lab and scientific practices.

This project is inspired by the observation that there seemingly exists a performance gap between on-sequence and off-sequence students enrolled in introductory physics classes. On-sequence students are defined as those who take physics 1 in fall semester, and physics 2 in spring semester, as recommended by their academic program flowcharts; whereas off-sequence students are those who take physics 1 in spring semester, and physics 2 in fall semester. Various factors, such as academic readiness and motivation, are believed to contribute to the performance gap. In this project, research-based instruments, FCI, CSEM and CLASS, are used to study and gauge the factors, with the aim of modifying curriculum design accordingly to address the gap.

As part of our NSF-supported curricular development efforts to create course materials to enhance the scientific literacy of undergraduate non-science majors, we are developing a survey instrument to probe this population's understanding of measurement uncertainty and proportional reasoning ability. By employing everyday items (scales, luggage, and kittens) and activities (weighing oneself and traveling) we have attempted to create an interview instrument and protocol that evokes and accommodates a wide range of responses and interpretations.
Although still in the development phase, we can report that our population has a very difficult time applying measurement uncertainty and proportional reasoning, even after instruction designed to improve those principles.

Teaching Assistants (TAs) play an important role in supporting research-based instructional environments, yet the connection between TAs' pedagogical beliefs and instructional practices is not well understood. In an effort to address this challenging and complex issue, we present a newly validated and refined framework, TA-PIVOT, for examining how physics TAs conceptualize physics teaching through both how they talk about and how they enact their roles in the classroom. This work builds upon and extends prior efforts to characterize instructors' beliefs and practices by examining both domains in parallel. In this work, we present the complete framework and use it to analyze interview and classroom video data. We also discuss how this framework may be used to examine variation in beliefs and practices, track the development of beliefs over time, and inform TA preparation.

A project that has been running in a high-�needs semi-�urban district in the central Ohio area for the past five years has resulted in changes in teacher behavior. Originally, the participating middle school teachers worked independently and seldom consulted one another. Minimal consultation also occurred among high school teachers. The project helped teachers become more active and involved students in hands-�on, minds-�on activities. Additionally, teachers now work together in coordinating lessons at grade-� level through the grant-�supported quarterly meetings of all science teachers. After several years, teachers began trading topics among the grade levels, and also started to trust that the teachers at lower grade levels addressed these designated topics with students. This talk will quantify teachers written perceptions of how the programs aims affected their teaching and their students learning over the course of their five-�year participation.

In the Maine Physical Sciences Partnership, we are studying teachers' thinking about energy as well as what teachers know about their students' ideas about energy. Before and after all instruction on energy, students answered a validated survey constructed primarily of questions from the AAAS Assessment database. Teachers took the same survey, answering the questions and predicting the answers their students would give. In two instances, differences in teacher responses are correlated with student achievement on those questions. Teachers with the most detailed content responses on one question as well teachers with the most complete understanding of common incorrect answers on another question had students with the highest gains on each of those questions. These results suggest that teacher content knowledge and knowledge of student ideas are both important predictors of student learning.

Students who serve as Learning Assistants (LAs) and have the opportunity to teach the content they are learning while also studying effective teaching pedagogy demonstrate greater achievement in advanced content courses and a shift in attitudes about learning science (Gray et al. 2011, Otero et al. 2010, Otero et al. 2008).  Although the LA experience is also valuable for high school students (unpublished data), the tight schedule and credit requirements of advanced high school students limit opportunities for implementing traditional LA programs at the high school level.   In order to provide high school physics students with an LA-like experience, iPads were used as tools for students to synthesize screencast video tutorials.  These tutorials were assembled into a digital library of resources for students to access and evaluate.   This research investigates the use of iPads to create teaching-to-learn experiences and evaluates the impact on student achievement, engagement, agency, attitude toward science and identity as a scientist. Students who utilized iPads to create screencasts report an increased opportunity for creative expression in their work, an increased confidence in their understanding of content material, and a sense of pride in their product.  Ongoing investigations are being conducted to determine whether student achievement is consistent with student perception of content mastery.

After four years of research we designed a 20-item multiple choice vector concept test (Test of Understanding of Vectors, TUV). In this article we analyze: 1) the reliability and discriminatory power of the test, and 2) students understanding of the vector concepts evaluated in the test. The final version of the test was administered to 423 students who were finishing an Electricity and Magnetism course at a large private Mexican university. In the first part of the article, we show results indicating that the TUV is a reliable assessment tool. In the second part, we examine students overall performance in the test and analyze the results of the seven most difficult items for the students: calculation of the direction of a vector, graphic representation of unit vector, graphical subtraction of vectors in 2D, geometric interpretation and calculation of dot product, and interpretation and magnitudes calculation of cross product.

We have designed an apparatus, which we have called a Partial Derivative Machine, that serves as a mechanical analogue of a thermodynamic system.

We assessed the implementation with a multiple choice test at the end of each activity and the CSEM (pre/post) with 12 additional questions taken from the Electric Circuits Concept Evaluation but modified to fit the format of the CSEM. Results indicate that RTP with calculators had similar learning results compared to Tutorials but some differences in the potential difference concept.

Course structure - the presentation, ordering, and accessibility of various types of learning activities  dramatically affects how students interact with electronic textbooks.  We analyze student-tracking logs generated by the LON-CAPA learning management system from nearly a decade of both blended on-campus lecture and distance off-campus introductory physics courses at Michigan State University, as well as on-campus and open-online courses from MIT.  Data mining provides estimates of the overall amount and temporal regularity of etext use, i.e., weekly reading versus review immediately before exams. For all courses studied, we compare student use of etexts as it varies with course structure, e.g., from traditional (three or four exams, etext assigned as supplementary) to reformed (frequent exams, embedded assessment in the assigned etext). Traditional format courses are accompanied by little etext use, while high reading levels persist throughout reformed courses.

A critical aspect of reform science teaching is grounding instruction in students scientific ideas by attending and responding to the substance of what students offer in class.  However, previous studies have shown that this sort of teaching is relatively rare in American classrooms and, when present, often fleeting in nature.  In this poster, I offer a look inside two classroom episodes in which teachers altered their plans in response to unexpected ideas from students and continued to attend and respond to student thinking for extended periods of time, with an eye toward what might initiate and sustain the teachers in doing so.  I specifically highlight the role that the teachers affect seemed to play in each case and consider the implications of my analyses for research and professional development on teacher responsiveness.

We examined the impact of preexisting interest in physics on undergraduate student responses to the insertion of life science contexts into an introductory-level physics course for nonmajors, using an end-of-semester survey. Our findings suggest that inserting life science context into the content of the courses influenced students differentially based on their level of preexisting interest in physics.Taken together with results from the CLASS survey, these findings suggest that certain types of life science contexts in introductory physics can support students whose initial interest in physics is less developed  to deepen their interest; however, not all contexts are equally effective.

The context of this study is a calculus-based introductory college physics course that is a studio-format course implementing the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE). Our study analyzes students interactions as they work together in groups, engaging in experimental design and how their interactions are related to their problem-solving performance in exams. Students are first given an experimental design problem. They must solve the design problem and learn new physics by working together in groups of three and collaborating together as a whole class. A day later they take an individual exam in which one of the problems is related to the experimental design problem they encountered previously. Using video data, we identify different ways in which students participate in group discussions when they engage in the experimental design problem. We then see if there are patterns in their participation that are connected to their performance on the related exam question.

The experience consisted of teaching physics with internet and the smartphones. These tools helped the professor to promote the cooperative learning. The professor assessed the students learning each class. The students only had to connect to Internet with the smartphone and answer the questions. At the end of the experience the students had to answer a survey about their learning and their motivation.

Moments of discovery and sudden insight are among the most importantand most elusiveaspects of the learning and doing of science.  Yet very little attention has been paid by physics education researchers to these Aha! moments, perhaps because of their elusive nature.  Using video analysis of an introductory physics tutorial on Newtons 3rd law, this preliminary study explores several open questions: How do we identify students Aha! moments in the classroom?  What can instructors and curriculum designers do to set the stage for these moments?  How do students respond to these experiences?  Video analysis reveals that by using common affective displays and discourse markers, all three groups signal their experience of an Aha! moment in response to the same tutorial question.  The groups vary in the extent to which these experiences are shared, as well as in the intensity and valence of their emotional responses to their sudden insight.

A set of 14 different science courses, across the physical sciences were selected for study.  Courses were selected to cover a range of science disciplines and to maximize the number of students who and completed all courses some time in the last 5 years.  Normalized grades were computed for each course offering.  A normalized science GPA was computed for all students who completed all of the 14 different science courses.  This data is studied in relation to the number of college credits students had upon starting the introductory physics sequence.

Deep understandings of physics require students to make sense of physics ideas and problems rather than recalling information or performing algorithmic procedures. Sense-making activities during problem-solving might include visualizing the problem situation, searching for a formula, or comparing the problem situation to a real world example. We surveyed n=35 introductory physics students about their sense-making activities while solving physics problems. The survey included items from the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS). We then conducted focus group interviews and problem-solving interviews with a subset of these students in order to identify the students sense-making activities as they occurred. Based on the survey and interview data, we make observations about the sense-making activities of introductory physics students.

This poster presents qualitative video data analysis of the process of crafting definitions.  In our data, small groups of undergraduate physical science majors craft a definition of the phenomenon of threshold for the purpose of helping younger people identify it in the world.  Crafting a definition is a design problem, requiring the balance of many (sometimes) competing criteria.  We will name and provide evidence for student competences as part of building an exploratory framework for how the process of defining proceeds.  We will also show how students were able to productively use their definition to make sense of novel examples.

In the early summer of 2013 we administered a survey to all past participants of the Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshop.  Survey questions were designed to further investigate interesting findings from our qualitative longitudinal study of 15 past workshop participants.  Topics probed included: affordances and barriers to change, student resistance to research based teaching methods, impacts of efforts from the PER community, and issues related to the demographic of the individual faculty. In this poster we present initial findings from this survey.

In a previous study, I allowed introductory physics students to create a notecard (or sheet) for their midterm and final exams in an attempt to remove equation memorizing as a focus of the course. I hoped to use the study of these cards as an epistemological lens that would uncover their perceptions and attitudes about the course. Without follow-up questions, though, epistemology remained unclear. I have continued this line of research by adding anonymous survey questions that probe why students chose to include what they did, how (if at all) the notes were helpful, and how their card preparation changed throughout the semester.  I will discuss the analysis of both of my data streams (notes and surveys), efforts to discuss exam preparation in the classroom, and future study possibilities.

The Partnerships for Informal Science Education in the Community (PISEC) program seeks to bridge some of the gaps between K-12 students from underrepresented groups and professional physicists. In this work, we draw on the NAS/NRC goals of identity and engagement to frame the field trips and lab tours for PISEC students at a large physics research facility. We present goals and principles of design for these events as well as observations from a typical lab tour. Using documented student questions during tours as a direct measure of engagement during the experience, we find that students interrogate their conceptions of what a scientist knows and does. Further, they also ask questions that demonstrate their attempts to reconcile the lab surroundings and scientist activities with their personal and cultural experiences.

One major challenge facing long-term implementations of pedagogical reforms in physics is student dissatisfaction. To study the nature of that course dissatisfaction, we use an expectancy violation framework, highlighting how students pedagogical experiences may differ from what they expect to encounter in an introductory-level physics course. Specifically, we are adapting the Pedagogical Expectancy Violation Assessment (PEVA) for use in conjunction with measures of satisfaction and class performance. For this pilot study, we present results from a preliminary version of the instrument, given in studio physics courses at Eastern Kentucky University and the University of Central Florida, along with a discussion of current validation and refinement efforts. Ultimately, our goal is investigate how differences between expectations and experiences are related to course satisfaction and learning, with hopes that we can eventually provide suggestions for how instructors can reduce negative affect in studio physics classes that have substantial student pushback.

The pedagogical importance of valuing student ideas has been firmly established on empirical, theoretical, and moral grounds. However, we often treat valuing as a binary construct: one either values student ideas, or one does not. In this paper, I define and distinguish between three ways of valuing student ideas: moral, instrumental, and intellectual. I demonstrate that novice teachers in the Seattle Pacific University (SPU) Learning Assistant (LA) Program instantiate all three ways of valuing student ideas and that they shift from primarily valuing ideas morally and instrumentally toward valuing ideas in all three ways. That this shift co-occurred with increased attention to student ideas suggests that intellectually valuing these ideas may support and sustain teacher attention to student thinking, and vice versa.

Existing research suggests that students who join study groups outperform students who do not, on average.  However, little work has explored how students engage in study groups and what makes some of these groups effective.  I will present interview episodes of undergraduate freshmen discussing their experiences working with others outside of class.  These students were in a seminar for physics majors that engaged students in problem solving in small group and in whole-class discussions, and that encouraged them to form study groups outside of class for their other courses.  Though many students reported studying in groups, I found wide variation in the goals, structures, and activities of their study groups.  These goals, structures, and activities may interact with the development of their conceptual understandings and epistemologies. This research is meant to motivate further research- using both interviews and in situ observations- on how students engage in study groups.

One goal of the Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics is to give women the motivation and confidence to pursue a career in physics. Part of our evaluation of these conferences was to explore the participants physics identity formation. Identity formation that occurs during college shapes vocational decision-making. 608 undergraduate women were asked if they considered themselves to be a physicist. A follow-up question of why or why not provided insight into their identity formation. The results from this study formed a set of characteristics that these undergraduate women believe define a physicist and fell into three categories  skills, attitudes, and experiences. This project has led to a deeper understanding of these students identity formation and provided us with insights into the undergraduate experiences that may foster the development of a young womans physics identity.

We use the term Winter Break Effect to refer to a shift in student attitudes during the break between the first semester and second semester of a two-course sequence.  We have CLASS data from a two-semester general education physics course sequence that seems to demonstrate a Winter Break Effect: in analysis of matched pairs, the overall expert-like attitude at the start of the second course is higher than that at the end of the first course.  No statistically significant shift is observed from the beginning of the semester to the end in either course.  The effect is visible in the overall CLASS scores; analysis by sub-category reveals that the overall effect is dominated by effects in certain sub-categories.  We attempt to explain these phenomena in terms of models of transformative experience.

The complexity of thermodynamics challenges many students as well as faculty. Understanding what a partial derivative represents may be key to reducing the anxiety associated with this topic. In this session, participants will engage with a sequence of activities designed to elucidate the mathematics of thermodynamics through multiple representations of partial derivatives and with students who have experienced these activities. Activities include:
  " an analogical device for physically representing changes that hold specific quantities fixed, 
  " experiments that provide exemplars of measuring thermodynamic quantities involving partial derivatives, 
  " thought experiments where students design ways to measure particular partial derivatives representing thermodynamic quantities, and 
  " an algebraic formulation of a partial derivative chain rule.
Several discussants --- including Ayush Gupta and Joseph Wagner --- will each then comment on how their different research perspectives can contribute to and are necessary for a holistic understanding of what happens during this kind of curricular sequence.

Learning is a matter of socialization. As such, we can build on efforts over the last couple of decades to further expand the goals of physics teaching and learning beyond the historic measures of content mastery.  We are now poised to examine how social and psychological domains impact and are impacted by the traditional content we so dearly love.  Drawing from a theoretical tradition that takes play seriously, I explore a few environments where play and 'messing about' simultaneously develop student affect and content mastery. At CU we are involved in: research documenting the engagement of youth in science to promote identity and content mastery; studies linking psychological effects to student performance and retention in college physics; and, investigations of the impacts of advanced undergraduate and graduate experiences that encourage productive messing about as scientists. These studies challenge the historical divides between formal / informal, content/form, and content/ affect.

Principles of learning and performance derived from research in cognitive science can inform how physics is taught and how learning is assessed. At the same time, common practices in physics education can be used to develop better cognitive principles of student learning and understanding. This talk will focus on three main themes. First, I will explore how basic principles of  learning can be used to develop optimal labs in physics education settings. 

Second, I will discuss how we can use psychology and neuroscience research regarding how academic anxiety alters thinking and reasoning to develop assessments that accurately gauge what students know. Finally, I will end by discussing how, together, PER and cognitive science can be used to help students perform at their best when it matters most.

Important studies on affect in mathematics education date back to the early 1970s. Interest on affective issues has continued ever since and also education psychologists have paid serious attention to emotions in learning mathematics. However, transfer of this knowledge to mathematics classrooms, student learning, and teaching practices is still a big challenge. In this presentation I'll shortly highlight the history and scope of research on affect in mathematics education. After this overview, I'll introduce the role of affect in students' interpretations, experiences and learning processes with a specific focus on their self-perceptions and self-regulatory activity in learning and performing. This theoretical approach will be followed by research results of students' affective experiences and gains based on a multi-institution, mixed-method study in college mathematics classes applying active, student-centered instructional methods and set in contrast with the experiences and gains from traditional, lecture-based mathematics classes. Finally, I will briefly discuss implications for classroom practices and social classroom climate.

John Dewey argued that the curriculum should be a guide and not a substitute for having our own journey with the content. I agree and believe the purpose of science education should be to transform the way we see and experience the world, an outcome I refer to as a transformative experience. In this talk, I explain the nature of transformative experiences and present a model of fostering transformative experiences in science. This model has roots in Dewey's theory of aesthetic experience and was refined through design-based research. Instructional principles central to the model include: (1) artistically selecting and crafting content, (2) scaffolding re-seeing, and (3) modeling transformative experiences.

Many prominent lines of research on student's reasoning and conceptual change within learning sciences and physics education research have not attended to the role of learners' affect or emotions in the dynamics of their conceptual reasoning. This is despite evidence that emotions are deeply integrated with cognition and documented associations between emotions and academic performance. In this presentation, I will present the case for a research program aimed at integrating affect with models of learners' cognition. I will present a case-study to argue that in physics learning environments learners' emotions can be intertwined with the unfolding conceptual and epistemological reasoning at fine time-scales. This case-study draws on video-taped interactions of a small group of students working on a physics tutorial. The analysis of the conceptual and epistemological substance of students' talk and the associated emotions draws on a combination of methodologies from knowledge analysis, interaction analysis, and conversation analysis traditions. I will also briefly discuss some of the current research on learners' affect being pursued within the PER community. I will end with implications for research, curriculum development, and teaching.

Learning physics is challenging because there are only a few fundamental principles in physics that are condensed in compact mathematical forms. Learning physics requires unpacking these fundamental principles and understanding their applicability in a variety of contexts. Cognitive theory can be used to design instruction and facilitate thinking and learning in the physics classrooms. In this poster gallery and discussionl session, we will showcase research-based strategies that can be effective in improving students' problem solving and meta-cognitive skills. These approaches include helping students use different representations of knowledge and helping them learn to categorize physics problems appropriately. Improved cognitive abilities can make learning physics a positive experience for students.

In this poster gallery and discussion session, presenters will first discuss research related to helping students acquire a functional knowledge in upper-level physics courses after a brief introduction by the discussant. Then there will be a panel discussion. Topics will include upper-level classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics and mathematical methods. Research in physics education suggestions that students in advanced physics courses often struggle with material covered in these advanced courses. They have many common difficulties in learning different concepts and these struggles are compounded by the mathematical sophistication required to master the required concepts. Helping advanced physics students develop a better knowledge structure and acquire functional understanding can reduce anxiety and make learning fun.

Research into the identity development of physicists has seen significant growth in the recent past. This growth is largely associated with the assertion that the development of a professional identity is a fundamental part of student development and the development of an appropriate subject specific identity had been asserted to be a strong influence on the retention of students in a discipline (Pierrakos et al. 2009). Encouraging the development of a students physics identity may help tackle the underdeveloped growth rate (National Science Board, 2008) of physics degrees awarded. This symposium presents research into physics identity development from several different contexts with a focus on the current popular research frameworks within physics identity research. Each presenter will discuss the aspects of identity they feel are important to study, why those aspects in particular are the ones they are interested in and how these choices inform the results of their studies.

This session aims to examine the path the community has taken in terms of conceptualization of research paradigms, implications of choices in research population, expansion of scope, and trends in collaborations in publications.

How can one convey to interested teachers and researchers nuances in the ways in which an instructor teaches? in the ways students learn within that instructional context?  in the details of that student learning?  What aspects of these issues, motivated by the need to communicate a culture of teaching and learning, contribute to a culture of research? One communicative approach involves the use of narratives, by which we mean documents that tell the stories of interesting incidents that occurred during class.  A narrative presents what the students and instructor said and did, with commentary based upon insights articulated by the instructor and perhaps colleagues while watching a video or listening to an audio recording of the interaction (see example narratives from the Paradigms Program at <a href="http://physics.oregonstate.edu/portfolioswiki/start">http://physics.oregonstate.edu/portfolioswiki/start</a>). We discuss the purpose, preparation, and power of such narratives.

In recent years researchers have compared scientific reasoning abilities of students in introductory physics courses with conceptual learning.  This research suggests students with more formal reasoning patterns are more proficient learners.  However, little has been done to investigate how scientific reasoning abilities relate to ability to solve different types of problems, including those based on the application of simple algorithms and those which depend on conceptual understanding.  In this pilot study we compared student scientific reasoning abilities, as measured by Lawsons Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning, to student ability to correctly solve both problem types on midterm and final examinations.  Results indicate that students with higher reasoning abilities perform equally well on both problem types while students of lower reasoning abilities struggle in solving problems that depend on conceptual understanding.  This suggests that students with lower reasoning abilities may depend more readily on memorization of simple procedures to solve problems.

From its early days, PER has taught us about the process of solving physics problems.  We learned  novice students classify problems according to surface characteristics whereas experts begin with relevant fundamental interactions.  We learned novices focus on mathematical solutions, ignoring the key steps of identifying interactions and systems.  We have successful classroom approaches, texts, and electronic tutorials that emphasize problem solving process. Yet when it comes to practicing physics on homework it is no surprise that answers-oriented students comfortable in an electronic world turn to answers-based websites like yahooanswers.com for help.  

This discussion highlights an interactive electronic homework support site based on the above PER.  Students in focus groups found the site useful and accessible for the way they study.  More importantly, early testing shows that students who used the site include attention to interactions and systems and evaluation of solutions more consistently than their peers who did not.

Aesthetics is often defined as the study of beauty. In the context of physics, what is beautiful? What elicits a Wow! Awesome! Cool! response versus a snore? Can we use aesthetics to deepen or change students perceptions of physics and/or the world around them?

We propose three tables: 
1.  Visual Beauty of Physics. Can appreciation of the beauty of physics (e.g. sunsets or fractals) be increased by deeper understanding of the physics, or does it spoil the fun?
2.  Aesthetics of Science Practice. What aesthetics might either drive or prevent the transformation from observer to practitioner? What are the aesthetic qualities that might entice students or teachers to claim identity as scientists, even physicists? 
3.  Cultural Aspects of Physics Aesthetics. The contrast of a Western reductionist approach with a holistic Eastern thought approach can be cast as a difference in aesthetic. How does ones cultural perspective influence aesthetic responses to physics?

Helping students develop facility with problem representation is a major goal of many introductory physics courses. We discuss two studies related to representations in which we investigated strategies for improving students' performance on problem solving. In one study, we investigated students' difficulties in translating between mathematical and graphical representations and the effect of scaffolding on students' performance. Analysis of the student performance with different levels of scaffolding reveals that the appropriate level of scaffolding is not necessarily the one that involves lots of guidance and support from an expert's perspective and that the optimal level of support for a given student population can only be determined by research. In another study, we investigated whether students perform better when a diagram is provided with the problem or when they are explicitly asked to draw a diagram. We find that students who draw a good diagram perform better regardless of whether they use a diagrammatic approach to problem solving or mainly use a mathematical approach to problem solving. Instructional implications will be discussed.

Intermediate mechanics is often the first undergraduate theory course that physics majors and minors take beyond the introductory level.  Unless their introductory courses were substantially reformed by PER-tested teaching and learning strategies, physics students may very likely hold unproductive attitudes, expectations, and habits of mind that have been reinforced from their experiences in introductory physics.  Such beliefs and attitudes will not only contribute to challenges they will face in their advanced courses but how they will try to respond to those challenges.  This targeted poster is designed to spark discussion about how recent PER and curriculum development efforts can help address such affective issues in the context of a reformed intermediate mechanics course.  Examples of teaching and assessment strategies developed in the context of the Intermediate Mechanics Tutorials (IMT) project will be presented. [1]  Examples will include those shared by pilot-site implementers of IMT materials.  Emphasized in particular will be the benefits and challenges of resources like IMT that incorporate guided inquiry but that are meant to supplement--not replace--a lecture-based approach.

The past decade has seen an astonishing rate of growth in the number of peer-reviewed PER publications. During this time some have come to see the PER field as "fragmented" and "divergent."

I will discuss these trends in the historical context of PER work.

Learning quantum mechanics is challenging, in part due to the abstract nature of the subject. We have been conducting investigations of the difficulties that students have in learning quantum mechanics. To help improve student understanding of quantum concepts, we are developing quantum interactive learning tutorials (QuILTs) as well as tools for peer-instruction. The goal of QuILTs and peer-instruction tools is to actively engage students in the learning process and to help them build links between the formalism and the conceptual aspects of quantum physics without compromising the technical content. They focus on helping students integrate qualitative and quantitative understanding, and discriminate between concepts that are often confused. We will discuss examples of materials and assessment.

The physics department at Texas State University-San Marcos is developing a Learning Assistant (LA) program with reform-based instructional changes in our introductory course sequences. We are interested in how participation in the LA program influences LAs' identity both as physics students and as physics teachers; in particular, how being part of the LA community changes participants' self-concepts and their day-to-day practice. We analyze both written artifacts and video data; our analysis of self-concepts is informed by the identity framework developed by Hazari et al. [1] and our analysis of practice is informed by Lave and Wenger's theory of Communities of Practice [2, 3]. Preliminary experience suggests that engagement in the collaborative physics education community elements of the LA program blurs the distinction between learner and teacher practice and increases LAs' engagement in negotiation of meaning in both contexts.

In an ongoing investigation into identity development in upper-level physics students we present three case studies illustrating the relationship between identity development and a students pathway through physics. Sally is a physics minor who gradually transforms into a physicist through her undergraduate research experiences and a developing affinity for physics as a discipline. Bob is a mechanical engineering and physics double major who attests a great affinity for physics but ends up dropping it as a major due to practical career concerns. Larry is a physics major who intends to be a teacher and repeatedly identifies himself a physicist. In this talk we talk about this group of students development in light of a framework which conceptualizes identity as having three integral aspects -- personal, practice, and participation -- by examining both interview and observational data. We conclude that discussions about physics identity development should not be reserved for physics majors.

Physics education research (PER) includes three distinct paradigms: quantitative research, qualitative research, and question-driven research. Quantitative PER seeks reproducible, representative patterns and relationships; human behavior is seen as dictated by lawful (albeit probabilistic) relationships. Qualitative PER seeks to refine and develop theory by linking theory to cases; human action is seen as being shaped by the meanings that participants make of their local environments. Question-driven physics education researchers prioritize their research questions over the pursuit of local meanings or abstract relationships. As such, they privilege research methods that match their particular question at hand, rather than methods that attend to the rich details of a particular context or those that emphasize representativeness or reproducibility. We illustrate each paradigm with interviews with physics education researchers and examples of published PER.

Cs�kszentmih�lyi proposed the psychological concept of flow as signifying a state of complete involvement and enjoyment in an activity.  When learners are in flow they are motivated, engaged, and completely focused on the task at hand, resulting in effortful learning.  In this poster we explore the connections between the concept of flow and our model of transfer of learning as applied to problem solving.  Our model of transfer purports two cognitive mechanisms  horizontal and vertical  that learners use to construct knowledge.  Further, it proposes that carefully designed sequences of horizontal and vertical learning which provide scaffolding within a learner's zone of proximal development can facilitate learners to navigate an optimal adaptability corridor and foster progress toward adaptive expertise as characterized by Bransford & Schwartz.  By exploring the connections between flow and our model of transfer, we hope to gain insights into what can motivate learners to become better problem solvers.

This poster describes work conducted as part of an NSF-funded project of research and curriculum development in upper-division thermal physics courses.  As part of this project, we have described research on student learning of a number of specific topics on which there is relatively little prior research, including elementary statistics and statistical physics (Loverude 2009), entropy and the approach to thermal equilibrium (Loverude 2012), heat engines (Smith 2009), and Boltzmann factors (Smith 2010).  A second key thread of this project has involved the underlying mathematics and its impact of student learning of physics (Wagner 2011, Wemyss 2011).  In this poster, we will take a broad look at the project as a whole, including research as well as curriculum development efforts, and summarize key findings.

Becoming a physicist involves learning to be part of multiple physics communities. In this enculturation process, students socially interact with these communities to develop physicist identities and understanding of what it means and takes to be a physicist. At the same time, students also mediate potential mismatches that can cause conflict between their physics communities and personal communities. In each of these communities, students develop identities that inform and are influenced by their participation and membership. However, because the students are physicist in multiple communities, we use the notion of a nexus of multi-membership to consider their collection of identities and how students navigate between them. In this study, we present case studies of five female students from underrepresented groups in physics in ethnicity or as first-generation college students. By examining the collection of identities, the impact of family and cultural conflicts on their identity development is highlighted.

Upper-division physics requires students to use abstract mathematical objects to model measurable properties of physical entities.   We have developed activities that engage students in using their own bodies or simple home-built apparatus as metaphors for novel (to the students) types of mathematical objects.  These tangible metaphors are chosen to be rich, robust, and flexible so that students can explore several properties of the mathematical objects over an extended period of time.  The collaborative nature of the activities and inherent silliness of "dancing"  out the behavior of currents or spinors certainly increases the fun in the classroom and may also decrease students' fear of learning about these mathematical objects.  We include examples from the electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics content in the Paradigms in Physics program at Oregon State University.

Categorization tasks are commonly used as a measure of problem solving expertise, but they might also be useful pedagogical tools for highlighting the concepts and principles needed to solve problems. In this study, introductory physics students viewed several pairs of problems on a computer screen and were asked to judge whether the problems would be solved similarly. We found that students who received elaborate principle-based feedback on their answer then increased their use of physics principles when explaining their choices, whereas students who did not receive detailed feedback continued to make decisions based on quantities and surface-level problem features. Additional study findings will be discussed and instructional implications will be proposed.

Drawing from earlier work of Gee (1999), Carlone (2004), and Shanahan (2009), we developed a framework for "good physics student role identity" or, more simply, "physics identity" which is a reliable proxy for students' affinity towards physics and is predictive of students' career choices. This framework was postulated to be comprised of performance beliefs, competence beliefs, recognition beliefs, and interest (Hazari et al, 2010).  Subsequent investigations showed that performance and competence beliefs are not distinct (Potvin et al, 2011; 2012) and the combined performance/competence construct is somewhat akin to Bandura's self-efficacy (Bandura, 1986).  Recent work has extended this framework to mathematics (Cribbs et al, 2012) and engineering (Godwin et al, 2013).  We conclude with a discussion of the future of the framework for understanding "best practices" in STEM classrooms.

Decades of physics education research and of research-based instructional practice have demonstrated convincingly the crucial role played by multiple representations in the learning of physics. Conceptual understanding is both reflected in and promoted by facility in the use of graphical, mathematical, diagrammatic, and verbal representations as well as in the ability to translate between and among different representations. Similarly, familiarity with topic-specific representations such as PV diagrams, free-body diagrams, motion graphs, and field-vector and potential-line diagrams is virtually indispensable for thorough understanding of particular concepts. I will review examples of research that illustrate some of the learning issues that arise with use of multiple representations, and will present examples of instructional strategies that have proved effective in guiding students to deeper understanding through use of representations in different contexts.

The University of Colorado at Boulder is involved in a systematic program of upper-division course transformations in the context of Electromagnetism I and II. Starting from faculty consensus learning goals, we are developing a suite of research-based materials to engage students in lecture settings, along with a variety of assessment tools at both topical and course levels to investigate student learning and course outcomes. We summarize our ongoing efforts, including preliminary results from our new course-level electrodynamics assessment, and a redesigned multiple-choice version of our electrostatics assessment. We also present early results from an analytical framework on student use of mathematics in these E&M courses which helps us characterize and organize common difficulties.  We provide a sampling of materials now freely available on our online dissemination site, and outline ongoing challenges both in terms of student learning, and sustainability of course transformations.

The ability to categorize problems based upon underlying principles, rather than surface features or contexts, is considered one of several proxy predictors of expertise. Giving students categorization task and then discussing experts' ways of categorizing problems can be used to help students develop expertise in physics and help them focus on deep features of problems. Inspired by the classic study of Chi, Feltovich, and Glaser [1], we revisited categorization study in large introductory physics classes.  Some problems in the categorization task posed to students included those available from the prior study by Chi et al. Our findings, which contrast from those of Chi et al., suggest that there is a much wider distribution of expertise in mechanics among introductory students than previously believed.  Implications for pedagogical interventions will be discussed.

Studying the participants in a field tells us about the shape of the research community and the development of its members and practices.  Who are the researchers in physics education (PERers)?  For this project, we operationalize PERers as people who have published in PRST-PER, the PERC proceedings, or PER papers in AJP since 1980.  We use network analysis methods to show how the community has changed and grown over time.  We investigate how individuals' participation changes in response to new collaborators, and how different research groups and publication venues have influenced the shape of the network.

How confident should I be that a published PER result will be useful in my classroom?  To a large extent this depends on how similar my students are to the students who have been described by the research.  Based on published results, I have tried to categorize the student populations that have been studied by physics education researchers.  I will compare these students to data about who takes introductory physics courses, and what courses they take.  In general, the students we study are taking more advanced classes and are better prepared than the overall introductory course population.  Our research focus on a select student population has been beneficial because it has demonstrated the usefulness of research-based curriculum development.  Moving forward, the PER community needs to better understand the needs and challenges of more typical student populations.

This research examines how specific tools can serve as boundary objects that mediate contexts in which students feel motivation to engage in physics. In this study I examine student motivations toward physics and the role of tools in reorganizing social practices in the classroom environment and culturespecifically iPads acting as boundary objects, bridging the cultural practices of students peers, the physics classroom, and the physics community. The act of creating screencasts arises as a central example of how the iPad can be used to generate and share physics knowledge, while allowing students to incorporate references that are meaningful in their peer cultures. The social construct of a boundary object will be elaborated to demonstrate how learning physics is, at its heart, a socio-cultural cognitive task.

The PER community has developed materials that build on students conceptual and epistemological resources.  However, little attention has been given to students technological resources, which are becoming increasingly important.  As digital natives make up the majority of our student population, a simple change of replacing paper and pencil lab notebooks with digital notebooks may have a dramatic impact on the extent to which students feel valued and respected.  Additionally, digital notebooks are more aligned with the way digital natives have learned to do their work.  Initial results suggest that digital lab notebooks lead to increased student achievement, engagement, and quality of work.  Survey results revealed that students preferred digital notebooks because they allow for easier data sharing and increased versatility.  These results will be discussed along with implications for instruction and further research.

This study investigates the impact of nontraditional evaluative structures in the physics classroom on student affect. Typically, physics students' answers in discussions and on exams are evaluated by the instructor as right or wrong. In the learning environment that was the subject of this study, students were expected to reconcile their own ideas with available laboratory evidence and reach consensus with their peers. The overwhelming majority of the 15 students interviewed expressed positive attitudes towards learning physics and positive identification with physics. Video analysis suggests that this nontraditional evaluative practice resulted in authentic scientific reasoning, persistence, and enjoyment among students as they engaged in scientific induction. These findings suggest that the relocation of evaluative authority of students' ideas and explanations to laboratory evidence and social consensus, rather than with teacher and text, can promote more authentic engagement, enjoyment, and a sense of identification with physics.

Research has shown that student choice and flexibility in the learning environment are linked to motivation and agency. This education research investigates the effect of choice and flexibility in impacting homework completion rate.  Two different classroom treatments were applied over two terms of an urban high school chemistry course. The first treatment involved flexible, supportive classroom structures that theoretically would lead to a greater homework completion rate. The second treatment (or control) involved the traditional, authoritative structures that had been in placestudents were penalized for not completing homework within the designated timeframe.  Initial results suggest that the flexible supportive structures led to greater homework completion rates and to higher performances on the district assessment over the non-flexible homework condition.  These results will be discussed along with instructional implications, explanatory conjectures, and lessons learned.

Dr. Sheryl Sorby has been conducting research in the area of engineering education and her primary focus of research is on improving the 3-D spatial visualization skills of engineering students. The ability to visualize in three dimensions is a cognitive skill that has been shown to be important for success in engineering and other technological fields. For engineering, the ability to mentally rotate 3-D objects is especially important. Unfortunately, of all the cognitive skills, 3-D rotation abilities exhibit robust gender differences, favoring males. The assessment of 3-D spatial skills and associated gender differences has been a topic of educational research for nearly a century; however, a great deal of the previous work has been aimed at merely identifying differences. Dr. Sorby has been conducting research aimed at identifying practical methods for improving 3-D spatial skills, especially for women engineering students. This presentation details the significant findings obtained over the past several years through this research and identifies strategies that appear to be effective in developing 3-D spatial skills and in contributing to student success.

Physics relies on students' spatial abilities due to the abstract nature of the subject matter.  In some cases the increase in cognitive load, due to mental manipulation of abstract ideas like electric and/or magnetic fields, can inhibit the learning process.  There is evidence that suggest the use of simulations can increase the learning process by reducing the cognitive load imposed by mental manipulation of spatial topics.  This work will focus on examining the relationship between using interactive simulations with the learning process, in conjunction with the tutorials at the University of Washington.

English Language Learners (ELLs) are frequently left on the periphery of classroom interactions. Due to limited language skills, teachers and peers communicate with these students less often, decreasing the number of opportunities to engage. Exclusion can be avoided with learning activities that invite all students to participate and contribute their thinking. We argue that environments and activities that privilege scientific inductive reasoning increase possibilities for emerging bilingual students to engage. This study investigated third-grade students' discussions about factors that affect how objects make sound. Students came from a variety of language backgrounds; all were considered beginner/intermediate ELLs. Results show that the goal of inducing principles from actual phenomena encouraged students to communicate their ideas and reasoning, boosting students' confidence in expressing themselves. Following the hybrid space argument of Vygotsky's theory of concept formation, we see how external expression could lead to internalization of science concepts, and to develop English language skills.

Studies in various Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields have suggested that in order to succeed in these courses, students need to have either high spatial/visual skills or have the ability to develop their skills simultaneously while taking their courses.  Studies in engineering, conducted by Sheryl Sorby and colleagues, have shown significant gains in retention of students, as well as gains in GPA, by providing instruction to improve spatial skills of incoming undergraduate students.  Physics, on the other hand, has focused on targeted areas of correlation instead of courses as a whole.  For example, studies have shown that there are correlations between projectile motion and spatial/visualization skills, but there have not been a lot of studies focused on the entire courses.  This session is designed to highlight research that was/is conducted in physics and engineering.

Research presented by panel participants explores the hypothesis that high school physics classrooms often promote fear of failure rather than the spirit and excitement of scientific investigation.  How do teachers of physics create environments that invite students to engage openly in communal efforts to make sense of the natural world rather than causing students to retreat due to internal fears of failure?  Data will be presented that begin to extract particular strategies for promoting empowerment and agency rather than fear and alienation. We begin to outline the characteristics of classroom environments can leverage the natural curiosity of students so that the very process of scientific inquiry can serve as the mechanism through which agency and empowerment is achieved. This, we claim, is the missing link in building what could be a very strong connection between the students intellectual, inquisitive, and social selves and the playful, social, and systematic world of science.

This workshop will examine affect within interactional moments to explore the significance of fleeting affective events in physics education. Participants will engage, reflect, and share their affective experiences in physics as a way to demonstrate the diversity and universality of affect within teaching and learning physics, and to motivate the need to research affect in physics education. Following the opening discussion, participants will work in groups to build claims with respect to affect through moment-to-moment analyses of video data from physics classrooms, tutorials, and interviews with students. Participants can expect to leave with a refined understanding of the importance of affective experiences within moments of teaching and learning physics and some practice using analytical tools and methods for conducting video-based research on affective dynamics in physics learning environments.

Learning quantum mechanics (QM) entails adopting a new reference frame for the physical interpretation of the world. The quantum perspective is intrinsically connected with math, which becomes a sort of referent for physical meaning, requiring the employment of new formal structures and a new interpretation of familiar ones. Different approaches in teaching QM evidenced that students struggle to draw qualitative inferences from quantitative tools. Within a research conducted in the framework of the Model of Educational Reconstruction, a 15-item questionnaire was administered to 40 physics students of three Italian universities. Semi-structured interviews were scheduled on a subset of students. Results concerning the transposition of experimental outcomes in quantum state formalism and its physical interpretation show that students mostly focus on square modulus in order to reason on physical information encoded in the state, thus neglecting phase and reconstructing the state by means of one measurement.

This study explores the relationship among several accountability measures in New York City public schools. The NYC Department of Education prepares a three-year Quality Review and annual Progress Report for each high school in the district. The New York State Education Department publishes student performance on Regents examinations in several content areas, including the physical sciences (physics, chemistry, Earth science). Science teacher certification data is also publicly available through the State. Statistical relationships among these variables will be explored to determine whether Quality Review and Progress Report scores are correlated to student performance in physical science and science teacher certification. From a policy perspective, school assessment measures have implications about the significance placed on physical science education in New York City schools.

We asked students in two second-semester introductory college physics courses to report on a weekly basis who they worked with on physics outside of class time. One course was a lecture-based course while the second was a studio-based student-centered course implementing the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE). We use social network analysis to visualize and quantify each students position and engagement in the informal learning community that formed outside of class. Our study analyzes the relationship between students' network positions as they work together in groups outside the classroom with their performance on exams and overall course grade. We interpret our results through a participationist viewpoint on learning. Comparisons between the two courses reveal interesting similarities and differences. While the learning communities in these two distinct settings may look very different, our results show the overarching importance of informal learning communities irrespective of course type.

Millions of dollars and uncounted hours have gone into the development of research-based instructional strategies for the improvement of undergraduate physics. However, many of these instructional strategies have extremely limited impact beyond the developer(s). Missing from the literature is rigorous research about change strategies that do work. Peer Instruction is the best-propagated research-based instructional strategy in undergraduate physics. We use case study methodology to construct the story of how Peer Instruction became widely known and widely used. This case study uses interviews with the original developers and document evidence such as publications and presentations to build a rich description of the early events and propagation strategies used (knowingly or not) that have led to the spread of Peer Instruction. This information has implications of for physics education researchers who want to increase the impact of their work.

Numerous studies, dating back at least as far as Piaget, have used buoyancy to probe students understanding of density.  A few studies have instead probed students understanding of buoyancy in terms of pressure, buoyant force and Archimedes Principle.   In this paper, we present a taxonomy of conceptions about buoyancy.  Included conceptions  were collected both from prior studies involving subjects having a variety of ages, and from our own interviews and assessments given to college students.

Many physics instructors are interested in using the FCI to evaluate their courses, but are concerned about losing valuable class time in administering it.  To meet this need, there are now several web-based versions of the FCI available, which instructors can assign as either in-class or out-of-class assignments.  To be able to compare results of the web-based FCI to the original FCI, the equivalency between the two versions must first be established.  In an attempt to do this, researchers analyzed FCI pre-test data collected from two separate semesters, Fall 2013 (N=689) and Spring 2014 (N= 1564).  During the Fall, students completed an online version of the FCI administered by WebAssign, while students in the spring semester completed the traditional version of the FCI during their regular lab sections. For each semester, the FCI data was collected during the first week of classes. Results of this study will be reported.

We focus on the design and study of a metacognitve approach to the professional development (PD) of high-school Physics teachers. We designed and study a courses that is a part of a two-year M.Ed. program designed for experienced high school science teachers. The teachers were asked to develop teaching units in physics and were given the opportunity to teach and apply their units to children participating in an enrichment program in the college.
The goals of our study were  to characterize the design principles of the teaching units, and to examine the changes in the design that followed the interactions between the participants  in order to understand the teachers metacognitive knowledge about designing teaching units in physics. The data included: interviews with the teachers; reflections of the researchers; the teachers teaching units and activities; and observations of the teachers' physics lessons.

This study presents a method for characterizing the participation and substance of student engagement in whole-class discussions. An interrupted time series design was used to make claims about the impact of teacher moves and classroom structures on the productivity of class discussions. The Physics and Everyday Thinking  High School (PET-HS) curriculum was developed to model scientific induction and relies heavily on collaborative discussions to facilitate student sense-making and consensus on the learning targets of the course. Videos of three sections of a high school physics class using the PET-HS curriculum were analyzed to determine the curricular structures, norms, and teacher and student moves that mediated productive dialogue, including maximizing student-to-student interaction. We discuss claims about what classroom structures, norms, and teacher facilitation led to increased student engagement, as well as implications for designing for and maintaining productive classroom discussions.

The Introductory Physics for Life Science (IPLS) course is one of eight courses, of diverse disciplines, at Mercy College to be part of a study to investigate a new assessment paradigm where student feedback throughout the course, as well as final course grades, will be given explicitly in terms of competency of learning outcomes, through a rubric developed to assess competency in those learning outcomes.  In this way, all grades will be directly aligned with learning outcomes. Not only will faculty have direct assessment evidence of student learning, but students will have a greater clarity of what learning is expected of them and of their progress in achieving the learning outcomes.  The first of two phases has been completed and will be presented.

An educational path on relativistic dynamics for upper-secondary students was designed and experimented. It aims at building conceptual understanding of relativistic momentum and kinetic energy; it exploits thought experiments and historically relevant ones, illustrates scientific modeling by induction and draws on relativistic invariant quantities. A simulation of light-clock was run, for constructing representations of time dilation effect. As for global learning the path effectiveness was assessed by comparing pre- and post-test. General interpretive written questions were asked during the teaching/learning process to find out intermediate explanatory models, reasoning patterns, problem solving skills in similar contexts. The analysis of interplay between the former and the latter sequence of replies is presented. Results indicate sharp conceptual change about (i) the meaning of kinetic energy, (ii) its mathematical expression and (iii) its increase ad infinitum. The ideas on (iv) light-speeds role in mechanics and (v) time interval invariance evolved significantly towards scientific conceptions.

Goals of introductory physics education have extended beyond conceptual knowledge to students engagement in the discipline of science. In our current project, we are identifying moments of disciplinary engagement to document and analyze, to try to understand what contributes to their occurrence. In this poster, we present a moment from an introductory physics class at Tufts, a student-driven debate about the accelerations for a block and a cylinder subjected to the same force.* This case is of particular interest for the number and intensity of student contributions, and for the wide variety of arguments they offer. We present video excerpts of the episode and an analysis of its dynamics, how it began and how it sustained.

The application of factor analysis to the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) has proven to be problematic.  Some studies have suggested that factor analysis of test results serves as a helpful tool in assessing the recognition of Newtonian concepts by students.  Other work has produced at best ambiguous results.  We report on our analysis of over 400 pairs of pre- and post-tests. The factor structure is more pronounced in the post-test with a more readily identifiable association between factors and physical concepts. We discuss whether such an evolution to a more robust factor pattern constitutes evidence of instructional efficacy.

There have been discussions about the nature of PCK and whether it is a personal construct that develops over years or if some aspects of PCK can be developed during teacher training programs. Research has shown that some aspects of PCK can be developed in pre-service teachers. A common thread among these aspects of PCK is the importance of kids prior knowledge. At Kansas State University a physics class was designed to infuse PCK into the learning experience of future elementary teachers. As part of the class students were required to develop a lesson plan that incorporated their understanding of kids ideas about physics and how to address those ideas. To assess students PCK we search for instances where kids prior knowledge were present and how students incorporated these ideas into their lesson plan. We present the results of our study and implications for instruction.

Scientific literacy consists of different aspects: scientific reasoning, nature of science and attitudes toward science. From all the attributes included in the scientific literacy, we measured the attitudes toward science and learning of science of high school science teachers in a scientific literacy course in Mexico to analyze how these attitudes are related to the development of their classroom activities. We used the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (C-LASS) with 310 high school teachers. Most of the teachers who participated in this study were university graduates, so we considered the use of this survey was adequate to explore their attitudes. The results show that teachers have better attitudes toward learning physics than those reported in the literature for college students. Real world connection and Personal interest were the highest categories achieved, while Conceptual understanding and Problem solving sophistication were the lowest. We analyzed whether teachers promoted the development of attitudes toward science in their planned activities required for the course. We found that despite their high scores in C-LASS, teachers dont include activities that foster attitudinal aspects in their class planning.

We will also present data on the correlation of FCI scores with the grade in Physics 50 for the "49ers" and the rest of the class. Our long-term goal is to identify at-risk students before they get poor grades in Physics 50, and consequently to improve STEM graduation rates, which correlate strongly with the grade in Physics 50.

Results and implementation details from a novel learning approach that extends the pedagogy of the Flipped Classroom (FC) is described in this study. Students in a large introductory physics class (N=805) were tasked with the creation of two learning objects (LOs) over the course of the term based on pre-reading material set for the whole class. An experienced TA screened the LOs for quality and relevance to the course with the best ones highlighted and incorporated into the lectures and tutorials. Implementation strategies that helped ensure a consistent submission rate over the course of the term spanning all topics are discussed. With a participation rate of over 80%, students appeared engaged and interested in the LO exercise and self-reported dramatic improvements in their understanding of the content based on a 5-point scale despite the presence of many other assigned items in the course.

Scientific creativity is an indispensible element of the process of producing new research, discoveries and inventions in the field of physics. In the development of learning environments that engage students in authentic physics practices, we have the opportunity to design activities and structures that encourage creativity. Drawing from the literature, we present a model of the creative process and product from which students scientific work can be analyzed. We apply this model in the context of an afterschool physics program for middle school students and analyze students documentation of original ideas and experiments, called Big Ideas, in science notebooks. Frequency and content of students Big Ideas are examined and compared to written work for prescribed activities.  Implications for promoting scientific creativity through curricular design are discussed.

The communication of scientific ideas and investigations through written documentation is a necessary and fundamental practice in physics that can be built into physics learning environments. In this work, we investigate how children participating in an afterschool physics program choose to communicate their scientific activities in notebooks. We both expand on Ruiz-Primos notebook analysis framework (Ruiz-Primo, et al., 2004) developed to evaluate written communication in school settings and adapt this framework for an informal program. Additionally, we apply this framework to analyze the ways in which the curriculum prompts children to communicate. In comparing the opportunities for communication in the curriculum and childrens communication choices as documented in their notebooks, we find that children communicate more frequently and in more varied ways than they are prompted. We situate childrens science notebooks within authentic science communication practices and connect these results to the broader educational setting.

While popularized for their potential of low-cost and broad access, Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are not fully understood nor well researched in terms of educational impacts.  This study examines some of the educational outcomes from a MOOC that was designed to parallel a traditional brick-and-mortar lecture of 900 students.  While the MOOC initially enrolled an audience of nearly 16,000 students, a mere 1.5% actually completed the MOOC.  Four times as many students completed the brick-and-mortar course.  Complementing the MOOC and traditional offerings of Physics 1, we also examine a special physics course held as part of a live-in residential community. In contrast to the MOOCs, these residential courses are characterized as high-touch and locally-based.  Student demographics, performance, and retention were compared for the three approaches to teaching the same physics content. All environments yielded similar normalized relative learning gains on the FMCE for Physics 1 performance, for those who completed the courses.  However, larger absolute gains and higher retention rates are found for the students in the traditional and more community-focused physics environments.

We analyze data spanning multiple semesters and instructors within a single institution to explore how gains and losses in Force Concept Inventory scores vary between instructional approaches. At the University of Central Florida, both calculus-based and algebra-based introductory physics courses have been taught in small (~99 students), large (~300 students) and honors (~20) traditional lecture/laboratory formats as well as studio (~100 students) format. Additionally, the algebra-based course has been taught as a lecture-supported mini-studio, where the traditional three-hour lecture is retained and the three-hour laboratory time is used for studio-type activities. Using the analysis method proposed by Lasry, Guillemette and Mazur (2014), we explore similarities and differences in gains and losses between course structures, instructors and course-level (algebra- or calculus-based) over the span of seven semesters. Additionally, we explore whether the trend that students with higher pre-test scores experienced more gains and fewer losses holds across these course structures.

I present results from a two-year study to classify student difficulties reasoning with graphed data. I will show large differences in student ability to use certain graphed data. Namely, students struggle more with graphs in which the variables have no relation or an unknown relationship than with typical graphs where the data shows a relationship. I expand on this finding and present evidence for three deep issues with graphical/data-driven reasoning. First, many students incorrectly assume there must be dependence between the axes of any graph whether or not the data suggests a relation and whether or not it was a controlled experiment. Second, students have interesting issues using a legend to infer information about a third variable. Third, by comparing pictorial reasoning responses to graphical ones, it is evident that students have deeper logical reasoning issues such as, if x doesnt change and y does, than x doesnt affect y.

The active learning in Physics has demonstrated to be a good set of methodologies. Now the question is which active tools are more effective in the electric circuits topic? And active learning helps with the problem solving and with the understanding of the mathematical model used for its analysis? In this research we try to answer these two questions with a comparison of two active methodologies. We calculated which group has a higher conceptual gain and in which concept or concepts using a pre-test and post-test with the principal concepts involved. For the solving problem, their abilities will be analyzed using a problem solving test; with the intention of see the answer and steps that do students that learn whit experiments and students that learn with simulations. We expect that the groups that used simulations have a better conceptual gain and answer better the problem solving.

Energy is an especially fundamental and cross-cutting theme in science, and is a word that students have plenty of ideas about before setting foot in a science classroom. It is crucial that invitations to engage with energy concepts evoke and unpack childrens thinking. While developing and pilot-testing a technology to support middle school students in capturing and reasoning about their own physical activities, we noticed that identifying characteristics of narrative reasoning in childrens explanations afforded useful insights into their meanings and implications for facilitator followup. Here we analyze episodes from an afterschool group where participants discussed energy transfers and transformations involved in hypothetical and enacted scenarios. We explore how reconceptualizing students energy talk as narrative reasoning may provide guidance in creating instructional approaches and tools that can help teachers see new possibilities in childrens energy ideas.

The College of St. Scholastica teaches a one-semester conceptual physics class for students from a variety of majors, including pre-service teachers, students intending to become occupational therapists, and students fulfilling a natural sciences general education requirement.  There was no math pre-requisite for the class, but the class utilized math at the level of introductory middle-to-high school algebra. We investigated whether there was a correlation between students math backgrounds and their performance in the class.  Student performance was assessed in three areas: conceptual questions, questions that required applying physics knowledge, and quantitative questions. Four years of data showed that, even controlling for student GPAs, students with less math preparation performed worse not only in the quantitative aspects of the course, but also in the conceptual and applied questions. This raises the question of why we see this disparity and how we can better support student learning in this type of class.

We are working to create an online assessment resource for physics faculty hosted on the PER Users Guide.  As part of the online resource, we develop implementation guides for each of 50+ research-based assessment instruments (e.g. FCI, BEMA, CLASS, etc). Specifically, each implementation guide gathers all of the pertinent information about each instrument information regarding access and administration, appropriate populations, typical results, research validation  and presents it to ordinary physics faculty members in a concise and friendly format.  This will improve their access to and knowledge of research-based assessments.  In this poster, we present an overview of the guides and other new resources about assessment on the PER Users Guide.

As students use touch-screen tablet devices, their hands can occlude regions of the screen, potentially impacting their learning experience. Here, we present results from an exploratory study of hand orientation and occlusion among primary school students using touch-screen tablet devices. Specifically, we investigated hand orientations, amount of occlusion, and the effects of tablet position (on table or lap) and tilt angle (flat or tilted) on students preferred hand orientations when using a touch-screen tablet device. From 15 interviews with 5th7th grade students, we found five hand orientations, corresponding to a range from high to low occlusion. Tablet tilt angle seemed to considerably impact students preferred hand orientations. Based on these results, we suggest that encouraging students to work on tablets with a moderate tilt angle (30-45 degrees), rather than lying flat on a table, could significantly decrease occlusion and increase the effectiveness of touch-screen tablet devices for student learning.

In Fall 2013, Georgia Tech began offering a "flipped" introductory calculus-based mechanics class as an alternative to the traditional large-enrollment lecture class. This class "flips" instruction by introducing new material outside of the classroom through pre-recorded, lecture videos that feature in-video "clicker" questions. Classroom time is spent working in small groups solving problems, practicing scientific communication, and peer evaluation. Video lectures constitute students' initial introduction to course material. We analyze how students engage with online lecture videos via "clickstream" data. Clickstream data consists of time-stamped interactions with the online video player. Plays, pauses, seeks, and other events are recorded when the student interacts with the video player. Patterns in this behavior can emerge and be used to highlight areas of interest in the video and improve the overall video delivery for future iterations of this course.

We report on the design of a simple natural language computer tutor that targets student difficulties with the concepts of force and motion. The tutor prompts students to respond in free-response natural language to questions that address the relationships between the directions of net force, velocity, and acceleration. The tutor evaluates responses and provides immediate question-specific feedback. To examine the effectiveness of the natural language tutor, we compared the performance between four training conditions: natural language format, multiple choice format, natural language format without feedback (time-on-task control), and a no-training control. The natural language training and multiple choice training provided learning gains with effect sizes of d=0.60 and d=0.46 respectively. However, accounting for time spent on training, the multiple choice training was more efficient. Performance of the current natural language implementation is discussed in terms of language accuracy, the rate of false-positives, and evaluation of typical student answer patterns.

Biology majors at the University of Maryland are required to take courses in biology, chemistry, and physics -- but they often see these courses as disconnected. Over the past three years the NEXUS/Physics course has been working to develop an interdisciplinary learning environment that bridges the disciplinary domains of biology and physics. Across the three years we have gone from teaching in a small class with one instructor to teaching in a large lecture hall with multiple instructors. In this presentation we will review quantitative analyses examining the effectiveness of this learning environment over multiple iterations. We will examine learning outcomes across the years including the ways that the students see the disciplines of physics and biology as related to each other. We will also explore the ways that the changing course norms during the scaling up process may have interacted with these student outcomes.

Researchers on the topic of IWB use in education stress that while important, mere technological mastery of the IWB by the teacher and the use of its technically interactive features is not enough for its productive use. In order to get the most out of the relatively expensive investment in IWBs, much of the attention has to be given to the pedagogic interactivity of the lessons. In a qualitative study, we investigated how our own lesson design, based on the principles of guided-inquiry and kinesthetic engagement of learners was accepted and implemented by high-school teachers and perceived by students. The feedback was then used to further inform our designs. Our study followed the design-based approach to research and used activity theory as a descriptive framework for analysis.The topics of the designed lessons were Kepler's laws in one case and refraction and total internal reflection in the other.

This paper describes the implementation of an introductory physics lab curriculum redesign at an open access, two-year college and reports on preliminary findings on student development of scientific reasoning.  We assessed scientific reasoning (SR) skills of (20) students in a redesigned physics lab.  Using a new assessment tool, Inquiry for Scientific Thinking and Reasoning, we quantified gains in SR sub skills.  Gains were demonstrated in the SR sub skills specifically targeted in the redesigned lab curriculum, including quantitative linear, correlation, control of variables (COV), integrated hypothesis, and hypothetical deductive reasoning.  Little or no gain was demonstrated in SR sub skills not explicitly addressed in the lab curriculum.  Assessed at a finer grain, basic COV sub skill gains were demonstrated.  These findings provide information on two-year college student SR skills and will inform future revisions of lab curriculum so that SR sub skills can be more effectively targeted.

Physics and Everyday Thinking (PET) is an inquiry-based, hands-on, conceptual physics curriculum that was developed for small enrollment discussion/lab settings. Recently, a version of PET was developed for classes with larger enrollments. Both curricula were developed using research-based design principles, including an understanding of learning as a complex process that builds on prior knowledge, and is facilitated through behavioral norms and interactions with tools and peers. This paper describes the initial development and assessment of a fully online, asynchronous course based on PET. We describe the conversion from a face-to-face to online format and how the research-based design principles translated across instructional modes. We find particular challenges with fostering substantive interactions among students, which we attribute to the courses asynchronous nature rather than its online mode per se. Gains on a multiple-choice conceptual assessment were similar to those of students in a face-to-face comparison course.

Despite the fact that approximately half of high school physics students are female, only 21 percent of physics bachelor's degrees are awarded to women. In a previous study, drawn from a national survey of college students in introductory English courses, five factors commonly proposed to positively impact female students' choice of a physical science career were tested using multivariate matching methods. The only factor found to have a positive effect was the explicit discussion of the underrepresentation of women in physics. In order to explore this further, a case study of the classes of one teacher reported to discuss the underrepresentation of women was conducted. Two classroom underrepresentation discussions were recorded, students and teacher were interviewed, and relevant student work was collected.  Analyzing the case study data using a figured worlds framework, we report on how discussing underrepresentation may create opportunities to increase the physics identities of female students.

Conceptual knowledge is only one part of what students need to learn to solve problems. Knowing how to reason through a problem is also an important skill. In this paper, we study the effects of computer-based training on students reasoning on introductory physics problems. Participants solved four sets of conceptual problems, each of them containing three training problems with solutions followed by one near transfer problem and one far transfer problem. We analyzed students verbal answers to elucidate the reasoning resources that they activated to construct the different explanations to the problems. We found that the students changed their reasoning dramatically through the process as they were presented with solutions to training problems and later posed a transfer problem. Our results provide insights into students activation of their resources and the procedure they used to construct their reasoning in response to the training problems.

Many studies have shown the benefits of student-centered, interactive curricula when compared to traditional lecture approaches. However, wholesale adoption of research-based pedagogies may not respect differences in instructional resources across institutions. We are developing a first-semester, calculus-based physics course that combines elements from several research-based curricula. Students conceptual understandings were measured using the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) and showed significant gains for the modified course as compared to the traditional lecture course. We see that adopting elements of several different curricula may retain a positive impact on student learning.

In a continuation of previous work, I attempt to understand students exam preparation by the study of their allowed note sheets.  A successful prior study examined freely-generated student notes and surveyed students in a manner which evoked occasional epistemological reflection.  Recent modifications have included the creation of online forums meant to inspire class reflection on the note-making process and a study modification in a single small class where students were provided a base sheet of equations they were free to add to.  As feared, though students had plenty of time and space to focus on more conceptual notes, and they still found the sheets useful, they included far less conceptual material on them, indicating disengagement with the note preparation process not observed before.

Implementation of cognitive apprenticeship in an introductory physics lab group problem solving exercise may be mitigated by epistemic views toward physics of non-physics science majors. Quantitative pre-post data of the FCI and CLASS surveys of 41 students, while describing typical results for a traditional-format course overall (g = 0.15), suggest differences in epistemic views between health science majors and life science majors which may correlate with differences in pre-post conceptual understanding.  Audiovisual data of student lab groups working on a context-rich problem, taken near the end of the semester of a first-semester algebra-based introductory physics course, describes each groups typical dynamics and chosen epistemic games (noting which are prompted and which are voluntarily chosen). We investigate possible correlations between quantitative survey results and qualitative audiovisual data, testing whether epistemic games utilized by individuals within lab groups on a coordinated group problem solving task correspond with expectations indicated from pre-post data.

By comparing student inferences about data tables and graphs, given in a familiar physical context, to inferences about the same data given in a more generic context, we found that students tended to base their conclusions not only on the data but also on their prior beliefs concerning relationships in the data. Depending on whether or not the data was aligned with their prior belief, this could either increase or decrease their accuracy. We also found that students have prior beliefs even in a generic context: they have a predisposition to assume monotonic relationships. This appears to contribute to generally poorer performance for data sets with non-monotonic relationships. Finally, we found no significant correlation of students ability to correctly interpret the graphs and tables with course grades; however, there is some evidence that their ability is correlated with a simple test of statistical numeracy.

We present results from ongoing research to better understand how writing an undergraduate thesis improves scientific reasoning and writing skills through impacting metacognition, motivation, and epistemological beliefs. Previous work indicates that scaffolding the writing process in a thesis-writing course can be an effective strategy for promoting better writing and stronger scientific reasoning skills. Our findings suggest that students beliefs about the nature of knowledge are, indeed, related to students exhibition of these skills. Here we further explore this relationship through analysis of the coherence of students various epistemological beliefs and the effect of epistemology-focused classroom interventions on learning outcomes. Data have been collected across multiple departments and institutions over two years. Ultimately, our analysis will be used to shape continued institution- and department-specific changes during subsequent years of this multi-year study.

A central goal of physics education is to help students learn to think like a physicist when solving problems. But what exactly does it mean to think like a physicist? What does a physicist do that allows them to successfully solve and understand complex, novel physics problems? We will present how we have searched for an answer to this question by using the resources framework to analyze videotaped records of physics experts solving novel problems. By focusing on moments when physics experts reasoned towards a deeper understanding of the problem and dissecting their discourse during these moments, we identify resources that physics experts activate as they make progress through the problem solving process. We search for patterns to identify resources with epistemological underpinnings which help experts make progress towards understanding a novel phenomenon. We present how frequently various resources are used and the implications these findings have on physics instruction.

The performance of introductory students on similar tasks used to assess their understanding of a particular physics topic can vary widely; conceptual and reasoning competence demonstrated on one task is often not exhibited on another, closely related task.  Indeed, performance is often poor on tasks that strongly elicit students' intuitive ideas.  Previously, we developed a paired-question methodology to disentangle reasoning approaches from conceptual understanding and used the dual process heuristic-analytic theory of reasoning to account for observed inconsistencies in student reasoning.  It has been argued that metacognition may foster the productive engagement of the analytic process during reasoning.  In this study, we examined the impact on student reasoning patterns of three metacognitive interventions that varied significantly in both focus and scaffolding.  Our findings suggest that, even for students with a robust conceptual understanding, incorrect intuitive reasoning persists and these interventions do not appear to engage the analytic process more productively.

A growing number of K12 and college educators are using the collection of interactive simulations developed by the PhET Interactive Simulations project at University of Colorado Boulder. The design of each simulation is based on education research and tested with students, and is honed to support inquiry-based instruction. The resulting simulations are also  simultaneously and purposefully  highly flexible tools, compatible with diverse learning goals, implementation contexts, pedagogical approaches, grade levels, and learners. While website statistics establish that over 45 million simulations are run per year, these statistics provide little information about who uses the simulations and how they are being used. We report on the results of a large-scale, self-report survey of K12 and college educators who are using PhET in their instruction. We analyze this dataset to examine, for example, who uses PhET simulations, with which populations of students, towards what learning goals, and with what pedagogical approaches.

This poster describes a whole-class whiteboard meeting and gives three examples of how they are used in a calculus-based introductory physics course taught using modeling instruction.  Students in one section are divided into six groups of 4-5 students each.  Each group creates a solution to the same problem on a 2x 3 whiteboard.  The groups then form a large circle in the center of the classroom with their whiteboards on the ground, resting against their knees, facing out to the rest of the group.  The instructor is outside the circle and interjects only rarely, if at all.  The goal of the discussion is to come to a consensus on the best answer to the given problem.  Three examples are given of amazing conversations where students overcame sharp initial disagreements to eventually reach whole-class consensus.  Students are learning the epistemology of science by actively engaging in it every class.

We developed the Partial Derivative Machine (PDM) in response to difficulties we encountered in teaching students mathematical concepts involving partial derivatives and total differentials that are needed in thermodynamics.  The partial derivative machine is a system that has four observable and controllable properties: two forces and two positions. However, only of these four properties only two may be controlled independently.  This ambiguity of independent and dependent variables enables the same sort of mathematical flexibility (and confusion) that is present in thermodynamics.  Because of the versatility of the model, it allowed us to explore the limits of experts thinking about derivatives, even those unfamiliar with ideas in thermodynamics.  We will present preliminary results from interviews with experts from several different disciplines, as we explore how they understand partial derivatives when given an experimental prompt.

Life science students crave coherence among the science courses that they are required to take, and are frustrated when these courses fail to talk to each other in meaningful ways. In an effort to bridge disciplinary divides, we have designed and iteratively implemented an Introductory Physics for Life Scientists (IPLS) course that aims to unpack the physical mechanisms underlying a number of authentic biological phenomena. We draw on case-study data to examine what it looks like for students in our course to build bridges between fundamental physical principles and meaningful biological questions. In particular, we explore the multiple pathways by which students connect different disciplinary explanations for biological phenomena in the context of interdisciplinary sense making, and the affective markers that indicate satisfactory explanation. We argue that achieving explanatory coherence in an IPLS course demands that we take up authentic biological phenomena for which completely mechanistic (highly detailed) accounts are not always practical.

In physics, we create simplified models of physical systems that are typically 
represented using diagrams, graphs, or other figures. Often, there are multiple 
visual representations available to illustrate the same model. While these 
representations might appear different superficially, it is important that students 
recognize that each illustrates the same model, and that students are able to 
determine in which situations a particular representation might be most productive. 
We conducted an exploratory study in which we observed introductory 
electromagnetism students working in groups to complete an activity in which they 
were asked to choose a representation of a charge distribution in order to answer 
conceptual questions. In this activity, students were also asked to justify their choice of representation. We present a preliminary analysis that demonstrates at least two unique approaches to using these representations. This exploratory work is 
informing new, more-focused studies of students representation use in 
introductory physics.

The differences in performance of males and females in physics have been well documented. While evaluating the effectiveness of the Learner-centered Environment for Algebra-based Physics curriculum (LEAP), results on the Force Concept Inventory for the first semester course showed that females in LEAP sections perform the same as males in traditional sections, which suggests that the LEAP curriculum might be effective in reducing the performance gap between males and females.  To better understand whether this result is due to pedagogical or assessment choices, students in the LEAP and traditional course sections were given the Gender FCI developed by Laura McCullough which replaces the school/male-oriented contexts with real-life/female-oriented contexts.  Propensity scoring was used to strengthen the findings as confounding variables can have a significant effect on estimating the effect of the curriculum.  The results from this work will be presented in this poster.

Metacognition, the monitoring and regulation of ones thinking, plays an important role in developing conceptual understanding and facilitating effective problem solving.  To date, relatively little work has focused on the role that metacognitive abilities may play as students engage in qualitative inferential reasoning.  We have collected audio, video, and real-time written data in order to identify instances of socially mediated metacognition1 as students work through qualitative problems.  In particular, we use multipart questions that tend to elicit inconsistencies in student reasoning, even when students possess the requisite conceptual understanding.  This work is part of a broader effect to identify methods for improving students learning in Physics by explicitly supporting and enhancing students metacognitive abilities.  Preliminary findings as well as specific examples will be presented.

Student attention has long been studied in various ways: analyzing notebooks, observation, assessments measuring retention, even heart rates.  However, new technologies can provide deeper insights. Eye-tracking is a tool that allows educational researchers investigating student attention to follow what they look at during a class.  This research is a case-study that focuses on one student for an entire semester as she attends her class.  This student is also diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder. She is an elementary education major who is required to take this physical science content course. She wore a pair of Tobii Glasses every lecture.  The data was recorded and manually coded in one second intervals based upon where she was looking. We analyzed the data and report on the trends discovered. Finally we followed up with an interview with her where she watched her own data from a class she had just finished.

We developed a set of activities that uses a double bicycle wheel system to explore the vector nature of angular momentum.  Students in an introductory physics class worked in pairs, with one student (actor) manipulating the wheel system, and the other (observer) obtaining visual information about the wheel system from the movement along a wall of the dot of a laser mounted in the wheels axle.  Students took a quiz on angular momentum and torque several days later.  The actor group outperformed the observer group, particularly on questions involving the vector properties of angular momentum.  In a related study using a similar set of activities, actor and observer participants were placed in an fMRI scanner and brain image data were collected while they were asked to compare pairs of angular momentum systems. Being an actor increased activation in motor-related brain regions which, in turn, predicted better quiz performance post scanning.

In recent years, many efforts have been made to enact changes in STEM departments, courses, and curricula in order to improve the experiences of undergraduate students.  These efforts have generally focused on disseminating curricula and pedagogy, developing reflective teachers, or enacting institutional policy, but they have rarely succeeded in creating large-scale, systemic cultural changes in departments. Our project tackles the problem of STEM education improvement via an "all of the above" approach by working with individual faculty, whole departments, and university policymakers simultaneously. Moreover, our departmental cultural change efforts will be one of the first attempts at such a holistic reform, and as such could serve as a model for similar efforts in other departments and at other institutions. We will report on our initial findings into the challenges and possibilities inherent in such an approach.

Teaching assistants (TAs) are often responsible for grading student solutions. Grading communicates instructors' expectations, thus TAs have a crucial role in forming students' approaches to problem solving in physics. We investigated the grading practices and considerations of 43 first-year graduate students participating in a TA training course. The study utilized student solutions that were selected to reflect expert and novice approaches to problem solving and to elicit conflicting considerations in assigning grades. TAs were asked to describe their goals for grading, list solution features and to explain how and why they weighed the different features to obtain a final score. We will describe how the incoming TAs grade student solutions. We will relate our results to the findings of a larger study which investigated instructors' considerations regarding the learning and teaching of problem solving in an introductory physics course.

This study investigated understandings and representations of the electric field among Chinese students ages 15 to 16 who had yet to receive high school physics instruction. Past research has reported on college students ideas of the electric field post-instruction, largely used questionnaires as measures, and mostly emphasized students learning difficulties. Moreover, by relying on questionnaires previous research may have inadequately captured students thinking process. The present study closely examines high school students ideas pre-instruction. We engaged students in informal group tasks playing a Web-based hockey game that replicated an electric field and drawing comic strips that used charges as characters. After these tasks, three students were interviewed to ascertain more details about their work. We identified nine ideas related to the electric field that students spontaneously leveraged. We discuss and compare them with findings from previous research.

Individuals' motivational orientation can influence a student's views on their academic potential and the actions they take to achieve it. Mastery orientation towards learning in particular has been shown to positively influence the scientific productivity of career scientists (Hazari, Potvin, Tai, & Almarode, 2010) and is associated to desirable learning outcomes. This study examines which high school physics experiences (including teacher practices and other classroom experiences) are associated to changes in students' mastery orientation using exploratory factor analysis and regression on nationally-representative survey data taken from students enrolled in introductory English courses around the U.S. in the Fall of 2011.  The implications of these findings for the improvement of the teaching of physics will be discussed.

Science educators need ways to understand and utilize learners' existing intuitions, interests, abilities, and ways of thinking to promote classroom-wide engagement in sustained scientific inquiry. We consider the role of narrative reasoning in students' descriptions and interpretations of natural phenomena, as informed by our research and development of a digital tool to help children notice physics quantities relevant to their own movement during physical play. We outline salient characteristics of narrative reasoning for interpreting childrens science ideas and begin to sketch instructional methods for building on children's narratives to enrich their reasoning about physical phenomena. We describe features of a technology-enhanced curricular approach that support children in constructing and communicating their understandings of physical scenarios in narrative form, and serve to document examples of child-generated narratives about physical phenomena.

Energy is an abstract concept, but students and experts alike reason about energy using ontological metaphors: metaphors that indicate what kind of a thing energy is.  These metaphors include energy as a substance ("This object has a lot of energy") and energy as a vertical location ("It dropped down to a lower energy").  Both of these metaphors can be productive, but each one has its limitations.  In our previous work, we have shown that students and experts can productively combine the substance and location metaphors for energy and coordinate them coherently. Here, we examine instances in which students are using both metaphors, and argue that, in some cases, students blend these two separate metaphors into a single ontology for energy.  To determine this, we employ an integrated methodology, analyzing both the verbal metaphors and the gestures that the students use.

Synthesis problems, which are problems requiring the application of multiple concepts such as energy conservation and kinematics, are common in physics curricula, and improving students skills in solving such problems is typically a key instructional goal. Despite the prevalence and importance of synthesis problems, many students struggle with them more than with their single-concept counterparts. In order to identify possible bottlenecks on this task, we asked students to solve a problem synthesizing two different topics (including energy, momentum, circular motion, and kinematics) as well as a pair of single-concept problems involving the individual components, varying their sequential order (synthesis + single-concept versus single-concept + synthesis). We found that students primary difficulties arose not only from the deficiency in applying the individual concepts but also from the inability to recognize the relevance of both concepts, which in some cases may be caused by one dominant concept overshadowing the other.

As classrooms and teaching methods evolve, novel technologies enter a students educational experience in a plethora of ways. For example, we have seen the increasing use of clicker systems and online homework systems within the classroom context, social media and online video sites outside. To investigate these technologies, we have used data taken from the Sustainability and Gender in Engineering (SAGE) survey to note what kind of novel technologies students are using and how they impact a students scientific identity. 
In particular, we were able to determine the usage of these novel technologies from students who have taken high school Biology, Chemistry and Physics. From here we then examined how students who have used a particular technology perceived their ability to gain knowledge from multiple fields, design and experiment to answer a scientific question, and interpret experimental results.  Implications for future technology adoption and pedagogical reform will be discussed.

Much time, money and effort has been spent developing innovative instructional strategies, yet widespread transformation of college teaching has yet to occur.  SCALE-UP (Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies) radically restructures the classroom environment and accompanying pedagogy to promote interactions.  Although SCALE-UP started in physics, it has spread to a large number of disciplines.  
This project deeply examines two secondary implementations of SCALE-UP-style at institutions that use SCALE-UP in multiple departments.  Key college faculty in these departments were interviewed to answer our research questions: (1) How did SCALE-UP come to be used at the institution?  How did SCALE-UP use spread within an institution? (2) What do faculty perceive as key features of SCALE-UP? To what extent are the essential features of SCALE-UP utilized?  How does this compare to other departments at the same institution? (3) What do college faculty perceive as the constraints, challenges and benefits of SCALE-UP?

We present initial results from a study on the effects of pedagogical course reform in two sections of an introductory astronomy course for non-science majors at Florida International University.  This reform was accomplished by implementing publisher-supplied hands-on lecture tutorials (LTs), which are short (15-30 minute) workbook activities that are done in class in small groups. Each LT is designed so that students uncover and confront common misconceptions about astronomical and physical concepts. The instructor, with the help of undergraduate learning assistants, acts as a facilitator during each LT exercise. Here we discuss the methods and challenges of implementation, and the impact on student learning by comparing exam performance in the LT sections to that in traditionally taught lecture sections.

Research has demonstrated that visual cues can help direct students attention to relevant areas of a diagram and facilitate problem solving. In this study, we investigate the effect of visual cues and correctness feedback in conceptual physics problems containing a diagram with respect to the comprehension of physics concepts. Students enrolled in an introductory mechanics course were individually interviewed. Using think-aloud protocol, students worked through four sets of problems containing a diagram. Each problem set contained an initial problem, six isomorphic training problems, a near transfer problem, and a far transfer problem. The students provided verbal responses to the problems. Students in the cued condition saw visual cues on the training problems, and students in the feedback condition were told whether their responses were correct or incorrect.  We discuss the influence of both cueing and feedback on students reasoning in the training and transfer problems.

Though there has been much progress in research on interdisciplinarity over the last decades, two significant limitations still exist. First, there are inconsistent definitions of what interdisciplinarity is. Second, definitions are limited to performance elements. In a break from this prior work, and building on promising preliminary work, we seek to define interdisciplinary affinity, a measure of students self reported interests and beliefs about interdisciplinarity. Based on hypothesized dimensions of interdisciplinarity, we draw on a large-scale national survey to build a useful measure of interdisciplinary affinity. Also, building on prior work, we investigate relationships between interdisciplinarity and physics and general STEM identities. This work will also examine the connections between interdisciplinary affinity and the interest and recognition dimensions of physics identity.

Computer programming has become a critical skill in much of physics research and undergraduate physics coursework. Our aim is to understand students complex relationships (epistemological and affective associations) to coding and design, and in particular, how they experience and perceive access to programming in physics contexts.  We piloted a project-based instructional module using Arduino Rovers (Arduino-integrated programmable robot-tanks) in a summer camp for high school students hosted by University of Maryland Physics Department.  Throughout the program, participants worked through several open-ended design tasks before designing and completing a final project. In interviews, we asked students to reflect on their experiences programming and their perceptions of coding before and during the camp.  Students in the program perceived different barriers to aspects of coding and design.  These have implications for the roles students take up in activities of design and programming and whether they continue to seek such experiences in the future.

This study explores the proposed advantages and disadvantages of the substance metaphor for energy in the context of a computer simulation that illustrates processes of energy transfer and transformation. We examine data from eight interviews conducted with introductory physics students as they used the simulation. We empirically explore the hypotheses that (i) student and (ii) instructional use of the substance metaphor promote specific affordances and limitations. We compare the language used and the affordances and limitations demonstrated by students as they interact with two forms of the simulation: one with an explicit substance metaphor and one without.

Visualizations in interactive computer simulations are a powerful tool to help students develop productive mental models, particularly in the case of quantum phenomena that have no classical analogue.  We describe efforts to refine the visual representation of a single-photon superposition state in the QuVis simulations.  We developed various depictions of a photon incident on a beamsplitter, and investigated their influence on student thinking through individual interviews.  Outcomes from this study led to the incorporation of a revised visualization in all QuVis single photon simulations.  In-class trials in 2013 and 2014 using the Interferometer Experiments simulation in an introductory quantum physics course were used for a comparative study of the initial and refined visualizations.We found that the revised visualization reduced the frequency of incorrect ideas about quantum superposition, such as the photon splitting into two half-energy components.

Students in algebra-based introductory physics courses are often found to have difficulty in applying their previous knowledge to physics concepts and problem-solving strategies, including electric fields and vector mathematics.  In order to better understand the steps students take in problem-solving and how different instructional methods affect them, we have investigated students' understanding of electric field concepts and problem-solving strategies for introductory Algebra-based Electricity, Magnetism, and Optics course.  Using common final exam questions, we compare the responses of students in the studio-mode course, those in the lecture-mode course with traditional lab sections, and those in the same lecture-mode course with a mini-studio lab section. The mini-studio lab section consists of students working on PER-based worksheets before the lab activity. The same instructor taught both the studio- and lecture-mode courses. We will present our findings on common student responses and how they compare across the instructional methods.

We are investigating student learning of quantum mechanics in two different contexts. In one approach, postulates of quantum mechanics are introduced in the context of the wavefunction of a particle in a box with continuous bases of position probability densities. The second approach uses the context of Stern-Gerlach experiments with discrete spin bases.  We have measured student learning of the core concepts in courses using these approaches with common exam questions and a standardized conceptual instrument. Preliminary data suggest a small but positive impact on students scores on topics related to quantum mechanical measurement in the classes taught using the discrete bases in the second approach. Preliminary data also suggest that using the discrete bases approach may shift student focus from computation to more sense making by providing concrete experimental evidence and simplifying the mathematical calculation processes. We will discuss the implications of this study for choices of initial context, the order, and emphasis of content being taught.

Interactions are the heart of the mechanics course and forces are the fundamental representation of interactions.  This suggests that beginning the introductory mechanics course with the topic of forces is a logical option.  An overwhelming majority of commercial textbooks, however, begin the mechanics course by teaching the concept of acceleration from a kinematical perspective before introducing Newton's 2nd Law.  This poster presents evidence that college students in calculus-based introductory mechanics perform equally well in a course that begins with forces as they do in a course that begins with kinematics.

Originally developed by Hestenes, Wells and Swackhamer in 1992, the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) consists of 30 research-based conceptual multiple-choice questions.  Over the last 20+ years, tens of thousands of physics instructors throughout the world have utilized the FCI as a way to evaluate the success of their instruction.  The question now arises is the FCI still a valid instrument to use to evaluate physics instruction?  In this poster, I will present a psychometric argument attempting to answer this question.

A goal of PER is to understand how students use math in physics contexts.  To investigate how students use math, we need to identify transitions between sense-making about physical systems and using mathematics to describe and make predictions about those systems. A key component of this work is determining when students use mathematical tools (e.g., vector calculus and Taylor series). We reviewed video of students solving a variety of physics problems in small groups through the lens of epistemic frames.   In this paper, we present a new frame, which we are calling "Just Math", that is similar to the worksheet frame, but is defined by brief, low-level, math-focused utterances between students. Future work will focus on analyzing the transitions into and out of this frame so that we may develop a more coherent theory of students' use of math in physics.

As part of a study into students problem solving behaviors, we asked upper-division physics students to solve estimation problems in clinical interviews.  We use the Resources Framework and epistemic games to describe students problem solving moves. We present a new epistemic game, the estimation epistemic game. In the estimation epistemic game, students break the larger problem into a series of smaller, tractable problems.  Within each sub-problem, they try to remember a method for solving the problem, and use estimation and reasoning abilities to justify their answers. We demonstrate how a single case study student plays the game to estimate the total energy in a hurricane. Finally, we discuss the implications of epistemic game analysis for other estimation problems.

The physics department at Texas State University has completed five semesters of having a Learning Assistant (LA) program with reform-based instructional changes in our introductory course sequences.  We are interested in how participation in the LA program influences LAs identity both as physics students and as physics teachers; we have previously reported trends in increased community involvement and a shift in experienced LAs concepts of what it means to be competent.  Our interview data now include first-semester LAs, and we see a significant difference in physics identity development between these LAs and those with more experience. LAs near the end of their first semester seem to be experiencing a state of unease with respect to teaching and learning. We explain this discomfort in terms of Piagetian disequilibrium: their conceptions of competence in teaching and learning have been challenged, and they have not yet constructed a new model.

Previous work on how students change conceptions in introductory physics courses has focused on conceptual gains without taking losses into account. We analyze Force Concept Inventory data collected before and after an introductory course for 13,422 students learning physics in high schools, two-year colleges, public universities and elite universities. When looking at individual answers, we argue that current gain metrics are only valid under the assumption that there are no losses. Across all students, we find mean losses of 30%, with little fluctuation from this value in all institutions except in elite universities (15%). This suggests that conceptual losses are important and that conceptual trajectories may be described as two-steps forward, one-step-backward. The instability of initially correct responses also provide more support for the resources model (positing conceptions as flexible and context-dependent) than for the misconception model (positing conceptions as deeply rooted and resistant to change). For conceptual assessments, we propose replacing current one-dimensional gain measures - that average over gains and losses- by a three-dimensional metric that reports students initial knowledge state and accounts both for gains and losses.

The STEM Teacher and Researcher (STAR) Program addresses the science and mathematics teacher recruitment and retention crisis by creating a prestigious dual "teacher-researcher" career path. Founded in 2007 by the Cal Poly Center for Excellence in STEM Education, STAR provides summer research experiences and professional development to pre-service and early career teachers. We present results from a longitudinal study involving the 176 alumni who participated in the program between 2007 and 2011. Survey, interview, and public credentialing data are used to characterize STAR alumni in terms of their progress along the teaching career path. As of fall 2013, 77% of alumni were identified as either teaching or on teaching paths. Aumni teachers reported feeling confident about engaging their students in inquiry-based activities and part of a network of teacher-researchers. The work presented here lays a foundation for understanding the long-term impacts of STAR research experiences for pre-service teachers.

Constructing and using models is a core scientific practice that has gained significant attention within K-12 and higher education.  Although modeling is a broadly applicable process, within physics education it has been preferentially applied to the iterative development of broadly-applicable principles (e.g., Newton's laws of motion in introductory mechanics).  We show how similar modeling processes can be invoked as a means to understand the real-world complexities of experimental apparatus and measurement tools in upper-division laboratory courses.  In the context of a think-aloud experimental activity involving optics and electronics, we document examples where students apply all of the key facets of modeling to their apparatus and measurement tools:  construction, prediction, interpretation of data, identification of model limitations, and revision.   A modeling perspective reframes many of the seemingly arbitrary technical details of measurement tools and apparatus as an opportunity for authentic and engaging scientific sense-making.

Michigan State University recently started an effort to improve its introductory physics courses.  At the core of this effort are a series of discussions with physics faculty designed to develop performance expectations for the introductory courses.  By focusing the discussions on the scientific practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas of the course, these discussions use the language of three dimensional learning as a framework for building consensus.  As part of a research effort, a team of discipline based education researchers has been working to generate tools to measure changes to the introductory curricula in the coming years.  Two new tools for measuring change will be introduced: The Three Dimensional Learning Assessment Protocol (3D-LAP), which examines the assessments used in courses, and the Three Dimensional Learning Observation Protocol (3D-LOP), which examines instruction in large introductory courses.

I will report on the results of a study designed to measure the effectiveness of an instructional strategy known as 2-stage exams or collaborative group exams. This exam format first has the students take the exam individually. Once all the students have handed in their individual exams, they organize into collaborative groups of 3 or 4 and take the same exam again with only a single copy of the exam being given to each group. Different versions of the group exam featured different subsets of the questions from the individual exam. Questions isomorphic to the exam questions were administered on the end-of-course diagnostic and comparisons, using the relevant isomorphic question, will be made between the students that saw a given question on the group exam and those that did not.

We conduct a meta-analysis of data from all papers published in PhysRevST-PER, the PERC proceedings, and AJP that measure student performance on the FCI and FMCE in college-level courses (76 papers, ~51k students). The papers' descriptions of teaching methods are coded according to their level of interactive engagement (a lot, some, and none). We augment published data about teaching methods with institutional data such as Carnegie Classification and SAT scores. We statistically determine the effectiveness of different teaching methods as measured by FCI and FMCE gains and mediated by institutional and course factors. In contrast to the landmark 1998 Hake study, a broader distribution of normalized gains occurs in each of traditional and IE classes. Over time, average gains in classes described as "traditional" have increased, suggesting that the definition of traditional teaching has drifted.

Previous analysis of common exam questions in introductory physics at Florida International University has revealed differences in the number and type of epistemic games played by students in their solutions.  Separated by course format (lecture/lab, lecture/lab/recitation, or inquiry-based), student work also shows varying use of multiple representational tools.  Here we examine representation use in more detail to establish a descriptive picture of representation use across multiple instructors and course formats.  We then compare these profiles with the epistemic games played by students, asking whether the same epistemic game shows the same pattern of representational tools across course types.  This study connects two neighboring areas of the problem-solving research literature and probes the extent to which representation use serves as a proxy for a more lengthy epistemic games analysis.

The sociocultural process of becoming a physicist involves the development of a students identity that is influenced in part through social interactions. For example, interactions with faculty can lead to professional opportunities but they also shape students understanding of what it means to be a physicist. While interactions in the physics academic community are essential to the development of a physicist identity, their identity is also shaped outside of classes and school. As part of a larger study to understand the development of physicist identities, we interviewed four female physics majors about events that each found influential to their experiences in achieving a B.S. in physics. We coded the interview transcripts for emergent themes including people with whom the student interacted, positive or negative affect prompted by interactions, and the context of the interaction.  Through this exploratory study, we highlight the ways in which their identity development trajectories are shaped.

As part of an ongoing project to investigate student learning in upper-division electrodynamics (E&M II), the PER research group at CU Boulder has developed a tool to assess student conceptual understanding (the CURrENT: Colorado UppeR-division ElectrodyNamics Test). This instrument is motivated in part by our faculty-consensus learning goals and can serve to measure the effectiveness of transformed pedagogy. In this talk/poster, we present measures of the validity and reliability of the instrument and scoring rubric. These include expert validation and student interviews, inter-rater reliability measures, and classical test statistics. This work is supported by the University of Colorado and NSF-CCLI grant #1023208.

In the flipped classroom model, students are typically introduced to new material before class by interacting with online multimedia learning modules (MLMs) and answering questions to assess their understanding (Just in Time Teaching). This model does not provide a natural mechanism for hands-on exploration of concepts early in the learning process, and relevant labs are often done days or weeks later if at all. At the University of Illinois, we are in the process of developing a program which introduces hands-on, experiential learning into the online pre-lecture phase of our calculus-based introductory mechanics course. This experiential learning is augmented with the Interactive Online Laboratory (IOLab) device, which students use with their personal computers to measure and display physical quantities in real time. This poster will describe our recently completed Spring 2014 pilot program, detail our calibrated assessment tools, and lay out continuing goals for this flipped hands-on learning model.

We have developed, implemented and evaluated suites of online modules for teaching undergraduate physics using an active learning approach. The modules are designed to convey core course content before class in an engaging format, viewable on computers and mobile devices. Each module uses a mix of text, images, interactive simulations, videos, and questions with immediate feedback. The approach provides advantages over traditional textbook readings not only because of the technology-enabled interactivity and portability, but also because material can easily be tailored to a specific audience, updated and tightly integrated.
We monitored student use of the modules via surveys, in-class questions and online analytics. The availability of the modules significantly enhanced the proportion of students completing preparation activities before class, compared to using a traditional textbook. Moreover, students indicated that using the online material was more enjoyable and they felt better prepared for class.

We introduce a new technology-enhanced learning tool for modern experimental physics  the Simulated Interactive Research Experiment (SIRE)  that is used and evaluated in a quantum lab course:

Many physics curricula provide courses on current research topics only in advanced semesters. The SIRE prototype is a complex and interactive simulation of an existing research experiment on matter-wave interference with macromolecules that opens opportunities for active engagement and curiosity-driven learning to undergraduate students. 

Similar to a flight simulator, SIREs allow the students to manipulate all the relevant parameters in the experimental setup. They can control and interact with phenomena and experimental equipment that would otherwise be inaccessible outside of specialized research labs. In order to allow an authentic feel, SIREs are driven by extensive and scientifically valid simulations of the experimental results. This even includes measurement artefacts and experimental limitations of the setup to provide the correct physical intuition.

Interactive learning strategies are frequently used in physics teaching, and increasingly so beyond introductory courses. Here we describe the development of a course for undergraduate students who are not majoring in the field of physics. By adapting the Studio format and Project-based learning and focusing the course on biophysics and microscopy, a course was designed to bring interactive learning to the topic of optics. This creates an environment that integrates lectures, lab, and simple problem solving as well as a focus on a long-term project for the course. The long-term project asks students to integrate the knowledge from the course to the building and testing of an optical system. The group-project highlights the interdisciplinary nature of the students who will contribute to the building of a working microscope and allows them to focus on their strengths. This course will help bridge the boundary between the disciplines of biology and physics.

Among the variables that can purportedly exert causal influences on student conceptual gains in introductory physics are two important factors: scientific reasoning and epistemology. Prior research on this topic, although increasingly well-received, relied mostly on correlation analysis or case studies to indirectly allude to the possible causality. Besides, these factors thus far have only been investigated individually, lacking empirical evidence for their collective impact on student conceptual learning. In this study, we conducted a path analysis to directly and collectively examine the causal effects of scientific reasoning and epistemology on student conceptual learning in physics (measured respectively by the Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning, Colorado Learning Attitudes Survey about Science, and the Force Concept Inventory). Our results revealed strong causal influences of students pre-instructional reasoning skills and epistemologies on their conceptual gains. Nonetheless, students post-epistemologies showed little effect on conceptual gains.

We examine the pedagogical behaviors of university undergraduate and graduate students during interactions with K-8 children in an afterschool physics program. Using an activity theory framework, we document several modalities of interaction between children and adults, and begin to unpack when and how these different pedagogical modalities occur. We identify at least three main modes of interaction during the activity: instructor, consultant and participant. Definitions and examples of these modes are given with qualitative contextual analyses to support their categorization. Based on this analysis, we discuss implications for promoting pedagogical strategies through purposeful curriculum development and university student training.

The Georgia Tech blended introductory calculus-based mechanics course emphasizes scientific communication as one of its learning goals, and to that end, we gave our students a series of four laboratory exercises with peer-evaluation intended to develop their abilities to present and evaluate scientific arguments. Within these assignments, we also assessed students evaluation abilities by comparing their evaluations to a set of expert evaluations. We summarize our development efforts and describes the changes we observed in student evaluation behavior.

Assessing student performance becomes challenging when course enrollment becomes very large (~10^5 students). As part of an introductory physics Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) offered by Georgia Institute of Technology, students submit video reports on force and motion labs. Peer evaluation of reports provides the primary method for evaluating student laboratory work. This paper describes the methods developed and used to guide students in evaluating each others' video lab reports when the course was offered in Summer 2013 and Fall 2013. Results of how students peer evaluation compares to experts evaluation will be presented. In particular, we will discuss how different guidance provided to students in Summer 2013 and Fall 2013 affect student evaluation behavior.

The Test of Understanding Graphs in Kinematics (TUG-K) is a multiple choice test developed by Beichner in 1994 to assess students understanding of kinematics graphs. Many of the items on the TUG-K have strong distractor choices which correspond to students common difficulties with kinematics graphs. Instruction is unlikely to be effective if instructors do not know the common difficulties of introductory physics students and explicitly take them into account in their instructional design. We evaluate the performance of first year physics graduate students in identifying common introductory student difficulties related to kinematics graphs. In particular, for each item on the TUG-K, the graduate students were asked to identify which incorrect answer choice they thought would be most commonly selected by introductory physics students if they did not know the correct answer after instruction in relevant concepts. We used our graduate student data and the data from Beichners original paper for introductory physics students (which was collected from over 500 college and high-school students) to assess graduate student knowledge of introductory student difficulties. We find that, although the graduate students, on average, performed better than random guessing at identifying introductory student difficulties on the TUG-K, they did not identify many common difficulties that introductory students have with graphs in kinematics. In addition, we find that the ability of graduate students to identify the difficulties of introductory students is context dependent and that discussions among the graduate students improved their understanding of student difficulties related to kinematics graphs. Moreover, we find that the ability of American graduate students in identifying common student difficulties is comparable with that of foreign graduate students.

Periscope is a set of materials to support university instructors in observing, discussing, and reflecting on best practices in university instruction. Periscope is organized into short video workshops, each introducing a significant topic in the teaching and learning of physics, such as formative assessment or cooperative learning. The workshops are appropriate for university professors, two-year college faculty, graduate student teaching assistants, and undergraduate learning assistants. Key topics in teaching and learning are introduced through captioned video episodes from exemplary sites, showcasing a variety of research-tested instructional formats such as Peer Instruction and Tutorials in Introductory Physics. Discussion questions prompt participants who view the episode to reflect on their pedagogical beliefs, on their own practice, and on the results of physics education research. Periscope materials may be flexibly adapted for settings ranging from brief introductory sessions to all-day workshops or weekly meetings.

While enrollment and retention figures often grab headlines for Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs), the more telling measures of MOOCs' effectiveness may be found in the educational outcomes.  The performance of students enrolled in the University of Colorado Physics I MOOC was evaluated with the use of numerous instruments.  These instruments include exams, homework assignments, the FMCE and the CLASS.  The performance of students in the MOOC was tracked across the semester and compared with that of students in similar Brick and Mortar classes at the University of Colorado.  For some measures (FMCE) their performance was compared with the results from large scale studies.  On all measures the MOOC students performed at least as well as and had learning gains at least as great as those in more traditional settings.  This may be due, in part, to a massive self-selection process skewing the MOOC population over time.

This research is part of an ongoing effort to understand how students participate in learning activities in a student-centered physics class that emphasizes collaborative group work. The context for our study is an introductory calculus-based physics class structured around the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) philosophy. In this poster we examine how students position themselves in group discussions and how their positioning is related to the dynamics of the group and to the effectiveness of the group as a whole. We observe interesting differences in how the members of different groups position themselves in a discussion and how their positioning is related to the ability of the group to engage in deep and productive discussions about the physics topic they are examining, and the ability of the group to complete the task efficiently. We find that in effective groups, group experts create space for other members to contribute their ideas.

When I began teaching, many students did read the book prior to class, but over time that proportion has dropped drastically. I have been frustrated that students fail to prepare for class. I instituted small-credit preclass quizzes based on that days reading but was disappointed that only about three-quarters of the class attempted the quiz. I really wanted a more engaging process to lure students into preparation. In addition, my classes on a regional campus are relatively small, so my solution would not have worked for OSUs typical (> 200) student lectures. I had an opportunity to change the direction of simulation software with adjustable parameters for Cengage that could reach students before class no matter how large or small. I describe how simulations became story-driven experiences that welcomed students, asked questions based on material, and was short enough that it could be done in advance of class.

Electronic laboratory courses are a common component of many upper-division lab curricula, but are often not given adequate attention compared to the Advanced Lab. We began a project to develop goals, curricular materials and structure, and assessments to transform the junior-level course at the University of Colorado to prepare students to more easily transition into a research lab. A unique component of this work was to use interviews with a large population of graduate students working in experimental research labs to help develop content and skill goals for our electronics course.

VPython (vpython.org), a free open-source module for the popular Python programming language, lets even novice programmers write programs that model physical systems and generate navigable real-time 3D animations. VPython plays an important role in several recent computational physics textbooks. At matterandinteractions.org are many lecture demo programs written in VPython. There are about 50,000 downloads of VPython per year, including by thousands of students in intro physics courses. VPython 6 is based on the cross-platform GUI library wxPython, which has made it possible for VPython animations to share a window with standard widgets (buttons, sliders, scrolling text boxes, etc.). VPython is quite mature; GlowScript (glowscript.org) is a related but very new environment under development that executes programs written in JavaScript or CoffeeScript in a browser. VPython and GlowScript will be demonstrated at the poster session.

Explicit writing instruction in our university physics laboratories includes a detailed rubric, good and poor sample lab reports, and a scaffolding process in which each week students include one new component of a written laboratory report.  The progress of student writing skills over the course of the semester was evaluated by analyzing student laboratory reports on multiple facets including the quality and completeness of the abstract, the clarity of the experimental description, the use of units and uncertainties, and the conclusions.  Several different trends are observed, indicating different underlying processes.  The quality of the experimental description shows a general improving trend over the course of the semester while the major change in abstracts comes after receiving feedback for the first time.   Use of units is reasonably good from the beginning, but students struggled all semester to use uncertainties in drawing conclusions.

Research has shown that experts tend to engage actively in a dialogue with themselves about how they currently understand the content they are learning.  In an ongoing project at Western Washington University, students practice weekly, scaffolded metacognition in the laboratory component of the introductory physics course.  Students write reflectively to contrast their initial understanding and current understanding of a specific physics topic, and to describe the trigger events that led them to change their thinking.  Goals are to enhance both conceptual understanding as well as the depth with which students reflect on their own learning.  We have developed a coding scheme to evaluate student reflections.  This poster presents the scaffolded activity and coding scheme, as well as preliminary findings about changes in student reflection over time and correlations between depth of reflection and conceptual learning.

We investigate kinesthetic learning activities (KLAs) as a new learning technologies. Teachers may want to employ KLAs to have students use their own bodies in learning to construct an appropriate level of understanding of physics entities, interactions and representations. However, few studies have investigated what characterizes learning opportunities afforded through KLAs. Using a/v recordings, we investigate characteristics of two different KLAs: A pulling and a circular movement activity. In both activities, students enact Newtonian objects. Here we characterize typical levels of affordances: (1) Students oscillate between playful behavior and focused reflective dialogue. (2) Students ways to enact models afford opportunities for a teacher to ask questions that foster and direct further student engagement. (3) Students make sense of the KLAs by linking their intra- and interpersonal experiences to formal physics knowledge. Digital learning hardly affords the same opportunities as KLAs do for students to authentically arrive at bodily experiences.

We investigated student reactions to a Computational Physics course incorporating several 'videogame-like' aspects. These included use of gaming terminology such as "levels," "weapons," and "bosses"; a game-style point system linked to course grades; a self-paced schedule with no deadlines; a mastery design in which only entirely correct attempts earn credit, but students can retry until they succeed; immediate feedback via self-test code; and an assignment progression from "minions" (small, focused tasks) to "level bosses" (integrative, authentic tasks). Through semi-structured interviews at the end of the semester, we found that a majority of students enjoyed the course and found the game-like aspects beneficial. More than half claimed that the point system increased their motivation; the self-paced nature caused them to reflect on their self-discipline; the possibility and necessity of repeating assignments until perfect supported learning more material; and the authentic tasks helped them envision using course skills in their professional futures.

Grant agencies are requiring documentation that goes beyond anecdote. We work with inservice middle- and high-school teachers in two high-needs urban school districts in Ohio. The Ohio Department of Education requires supported programs to involve at least 120 hours of professional development, with at least half during the school year. We estimate that new teachers who attend the summer institutes received at least 188 hours of professional development involvement this past year (70 h, summer; 70 h, grade-level meetings; 48 to 96 h, CFA analyses; plus staff classroom visits and voluntary attendance at professional society meetings). We expect to see changes in teacher practice as a result. This poster explains our attempt to quantify changes in teacher practice by using RTOP and other self-assessments to quantify changes in teachers and teaching practice.

We are developing and assessing a quantum interactive learning tutorial (QuILT) on quantum erasure.  The quantum eraser apparatus uses a Mach Zehnder Interferometer with single photons and exposes students to contemporary applications of quantum mechanics. The QuILT strives to help students develop the ability to apply quantum principles in physical situations, explore differences between classical and quantum ideas, and organize knowledge hierarchically. The QuILTs adapt existing visualization tools to help students build physical intuition about non-intuitive quantum phenomena. Details of the development and assessment will be discussed.

The QuILT actively engages students in the learning process and helps them build links between the formalism and the conceptual aspects of quantum physics without compromising the technical content. Details of the development and assessment will be discussed. This work is supported by the National Science Foundation.

The idea of flipped classroom has caught an attention recently in the Japanese education community. News media reports more than a handful of examples of implementation of flipped classroom in various school levels in the country. In this presentation, pros and cons of flipped classroom in college introductory physics in Japan are examined and discussed based on the basic notions that have been developed in PER.  We found that there are some big assumptions that are hidden under the discussion of the merits of the flipped classroom approach. Data will be shown to indicate how Japanese science educators are not aware of the assumptions. We will argue that the importance of re-examining the meaning of an educational approach in a cultural context before agreeing with the mere import of it.

Physics students epistemological framing influences their reasoning and what they learn. [1, 2] In previous work we observed the likelihood of students correctly answering a kinematics question that is easily solved using common sense depended on preceding questions which aimed to prime intuitive reasoning or school-ish answer production. [3] That finding suggests the priming questions elicited different epistemological framings or expectations.  However, further analysis of the written survey responses and some think-aloud data call this explanation into question.  Our analysis identifies significant similarities in the epistemological expectations of correct and incorrect responders.  Hutchison and Elby noted that students who answered the kinematics question incorrectly had misinterpreted it, and argued this misinterpretation was a signal of their epistemological expectations. [4] That may be, but if correct and incorrect responders have similar epistemological expectations then a more subtle explanation is needed.

PER-based reform curricula are commonly evaluated on whether they improve such factors as student conceptual understanding, problem-solving skills, or epistemologies.  However, recent work has pointed out the importance of studying student affect and its entanglement with these conceptual and epistemological factors.  We present students ratings of their enjoyment of discussion section activities emphasizing making sense of conceptual ideas with group discussion.  Although there were no differences in enjoyment between the two activities and post-test score did not differ by enjoyment, pre-instruction CLASS scores on 3 categories, Problem-Solving Sophistication, Problem-Solving Confidence, and Applied Conceptual Understanding, did differ by enjoyment: students who enjoyed the activity gave more favorable (expert-like) responses on these CLASS categories than students who did not enjoy the activity.  This preliminary finding necessitates future research elucidating how epistemology, enjoyment, and classroom activities are interrelated.

The Colorado Upper-Division Electrostatics (CUE) Diagnostic is an exam developed as a part of the curriculum reform at the University of Colorado at Boulder. It was designed to assess student conceptual learning of the upper-division electricity and magnetism (E&M). Using the CUE we have been documenting students understanding of E&M at Oregon State University (OSU) over a period of 5 years. Our preliminary analysis indicates that the CUE identifies concepts that are generally difficult for students, regardless of the curriculum. The overall pattern of OSU students scores reproduces the pattern in Chasteen et al. [Phys. Rev. ST PER 8, 020108 (2012)]. There are, however, some important differences that we will address. In particular, our students struggle with the CUE problems involving the separation of variables. We will discuss the possible causes for this, as well as the steps we might take to rectify the issue.

End-of-course assessments play important roles in the on-going attempt to improve instruction in physics courses: (1) Comparison of students' performance on assessments before and after instruction gives a measure of student learning; (2) Analysis of students' answers to assessment items provides insight into students difficulties with specific concepts and practices. While open-ended assessments scored with detailed rubrics provide useful information about student reasoning to researchers, end users need to score students' responses so that they may obtain meaningful feedback on their instruction. One solution that satisfies end users and researchers is a grading rubric that separates scoring student work and uncovering student difficulties. We have constructed a separable rubric for the Colorado Classical Mechanics/Math Methods Instrument that has been used by untrained graders to score the assessment reliably, and by researchers to unpack common student difficulties. Here we present rubric development, measures of inter-rater reliability, and some uncovered difficulties.

As part of a new effort to investigate the learning and teaching of concepts in thermodynamics and electronics in both physics and engineering, we have been examining student learning of thermodynamics in mechanical and chemical engineering and physics courses.  In thermodynamics, students must grapple with multivariable dependence between state properties.  They are also taught to use simplified models of real substances (e.g., ideal gas).  By varying a task we have previously studied which probes students understanding of the First Law, its constituent elements, and graphical representations, we access additional specific knowledge of the univariant temperature dependence of the internal energy of an ideal gas.  Our results show that use of this concept varies across disciplines despite being covered in all.  Additionally, the task alteration suppresses the most common previously identified difficulty and elicits others to give a more complete understanding of student reasoning.

Introductory university physics frequently requires students to construct integrals. To explore students abilities with this skill, we administered a simple physics problem requiring the construction of an integral to students enrolled in calculus-based introductory physics. Half of these students received written questions intended to scaffold construction of the integral, and the other half were not provided with scaffolding. Results indicate a strong interaction between scaffolding and student course grade. Specifically, students whose final class grade was above the median benefited significantly from the scaffolding, and students with grades below the median performed significantly worse with the scaffolding. We also searched for other knowledge and skill factors that may inform instruction to improve integral construction skills, including spatial reasoning (via the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test) and conceptual understanding of the integral. Moderate, independent correlations with integral score were found for each, suggesting that instruction in these areas may positively influence performance.

Although there has been interest in problem/project-based learning in the PER community as an active engagement strategy, most work done to date, however, has focused on introductory courses. This poster describes research on upper-division quantum mechanics, a junior/senior level course at Creighton University, which was taught using PBL pedagogy with no in-class lectures.  Growth and changes in student epistemologies as a result of the non-traditional pedagogy are presented.  In particular, students emerged from a project-based course more confident in their abilities to dig into the textbook, seek out and find literature, and better prepared to be in charge of their own learning.  Students felt more confident to confront more realistic, research-like problems and to succeed in future graduate work.

Climate change is an important challenge of our time but public understanding of it is limited at best. Newly released Next Generation Science Standards (2013) suggests that climate change be taught from the middle school level onwards. We think that teaching of this complex topic needs to begin with what students know about weather, climate, climate change, and global warming. This exploration of student understanding needs to be done at the level where climate change education is expected to begin. To meet this need, we explored middle school students responses to open-ended questions and constructed student models of these concepts. These models have implications for curriculum development and instruction at the secondary (7-12) grades.

In order to make informed changes to their teaching practice, educators need access to data that indicates what is actually happening in their classroom.  To aid in this process, we are developing an application that provides instructors with an illustrative view of how students participate in their class. SPOT is a real-time computerized observing protocol built on the same platform as the Real-time Instructor Observing Tool (RIOT).  While RIOT is instructor focused, SPOT allows an observer to map out which students are participating, and how they are doing so in order to inform instructors how diverse their classroom participation landscape is.  Furthermore, SPOT is being developed to explicitly capture observable indicators for positive student outcomes as identified by the literature. Visitors will be able to try out our prototype on their smartphone, tablet, or laptop.

Expanding our knowledge of student difficulties with advanced undergraduate electromagnetism is essential if we are to develop effective instructional materials.  Drawing on in-class observations, student interviews and written responses to conceptual assessment questions, we document specific epistemological tools that students draw on when reasoning about the divergence of a vector field.  Many students mistakenly associate a non-zero divergence of the electric field at the location of a point charge with a global property of the field everywhere in space, and frequently rely on a more colloquial meaning of "divergence" (corresponding to field lines "spreading out"), even when this conflicts with their understanding of Gauss' law in differential form.  Students may also struggle to reconcile the implications of Gauss' law for magnetic fields with unphysical idealizations used for mathematical convenience.

As part of a new effort to investigate the learning and teaching of concepts in thermodynamics and electronics that are integral to both undergraduate physics and engineering programs, we have been examining student learning in electrical engineering and physics courses on circuits and electronics.  Due to the considerable overlap in the content coverage, we have been able to administer the same (or similar) questions to students in both disciplines.  A major goal of this work is to investigate the impact of disciplinary context on the nature of student understanding, including the prevalence of specific difficulties.  This poster will focus on the concept of loading, which is critical for the design and analysis of circuits in all courses studied. Preliminary results will be presented and implications for instruction will be discussed.

Student pushback is one reason that faculty may abandon attempts to make physics courses more interactive. In an ongoing effort to understand sources of that pushback, we studied students enrolled in five sections of studio-style algebra-based physics over two semesters at Eastern Kentucky University. Students (total N=184) completed a modified Pedagogical Expectancy Violation Assessment (PEVA) containing 16 common pedagogical activities. The activities clustered into five factors based on reported frequency of occurrence. One factor contained items related to various support provided by the instructor: encouragement, feedback, one-on-one discussions, and demonstrating how to solve problems. When controlling for students grades and the lead instructor, students satisfaction on that factor was directly associated with their satisfaction in the course as a whole. Because instructors have direct control over activities in that factor, this study investigates relationships between students expectations, perceived experiences, and satisfaction for those activities in particular.

In the first years of university, results of PER show consistently that students dont relate electric circuit phenomena with the concepts studied previously in electrostatics. The present work focuses on students explanations about stationary states in direct current (dc) electric circuits regarding elements of theoretical explicative models (Drudes model and Surface charge model). We inquiry about students description at microscopic and macroscopic levels in terms of the electric field, electric potential and surfaces charges for explaining dc simple circuits. Some specific examples of the questions used to carry out the investigation will be discussed. The results will be used to develop further research on the ongoing investigation.

Based on student written responses and student interview data, this presentation reports on the influence of students prior conceptual models when learning novel complex physical processes. Specifically, we report on the extent to which students in introductory physics courses spontaneously apply conservation laws when explaining the process of gamma ray production during electron-positron annihilation. Also reported here are results from an investigation exploring the degree to which various types of hints influence students performances and responses when explaining the same process.

Responsive teaching has been found to have a positive effect on students' learning. Therefore, the aim to generate responsive environments in the student-instructor interaction is important. However, in what measure, the responsive environment provokes responsiveness among peers? We analyze a group discussion during an active learning electricity and magnetism class in a SCALE-UP-type classroom. Students engage in a highly responsive discussion among each other while trying to analyze the experimental results of a Gaussian gun. We observe that when students are open to explore different solutions to a problem, they try to understand their peers ideas and question them without being evaluative. We observe different student profiles that can facilitate a responsive environment, and others that can difficult it. Despite the differences, all of the students are able to engage in a responsive environment that could improve their learning process.

One of the teaching innovations that had been proposed to help students develop better conceptual understanding among students is the use of inquiry-based approach in teaching. In this study, we investigated students ability to apply concepts learned from conducting an inquiry-based physics laboratory in two-dimensional motion. Students were asked to answer two making connections questions that require them to apply concepts of projectile motion. Most of the students were able to recognize that the object in the problem will not take a linear path,  but only a few were able to justify their answers using scientific explanations. In this paper, we will discuss the variations in students explanations of the two making connections problems.

The context of our study is a calculus-based, studio-format introductory college physics course implementing the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE). We have gathered data that allows us to quantify students participation in three broad areas of the physics class: In-class learning activities, class review that happened at the beginning of every class, and the informal learning community that formed outside of class time. Using video data, classroom observations, and students self-reports, we quantified students participation in these three aspects of the class throughout a single semester. We investigated the relationship between students participation and their success in the course as measured by their FCI gain, exam scores, and overall course grade. Our results reveal different aspects of the class play distinct roles in learning.

Many research-based instructional strategies have required students to read the textbook prior to class, with the hope that by studying the book, students will develop the knowledge they need to participate in class discussion.  Yet student reading may be ineffective if the students lack prior knowledge or metacognitive skills that they need to understand the textbook.   We asked: to what extent do students make use of prior knowledge and metacognitive skills when reading textbooks, and how does this knowledge vary between students?  We performed think-aloud interviews with both introductory-level and advanced physics students, using a textbook passage about pressure and density.  To the extent that students vary in their use of prior knowledge when reading, we would expect that students will learn differently from reading, and we test this hypothesis by correlating students learning gains with their use of prior knowledge.

As part of a project to explore successful strategies for using studio methods, such as SCALE-UP, with diverse student populations and institutional structures, we want to identify what student characteristics are associated with different outcomes. As a first step, we compiled questions from several existing surveys designed to measure characteristics such as attitudes toward learning, experiences outside the classroom and demographics. Here, we analyze relationships between students demographic backgrounds, such as gender, ethnicity, residence, and past physics experience, and their conceptual understanding as measured by the Force Concept Inventory. We present results from four Spring 2014 first-semester studio-mode introductory physics courses: two algebra-based (N=108) and two calculus-based (N=116), each with different instructors. Along with our results, we highlight the use of bootstrapping methods to construct standard errors and effect size confidence intervals, which are a better approach than traditional methods when data is non-normally distributed or the distribution is unknown.

In this poster we will present the latest version of our survey instrument to probe undergraduate non-science majors understanding of measurement uncertainty and proportional reasoning. Using everyday items (scales, luggage, and kittens) and activities (weighing oneself and traveling) we have attempted to create an interview instrument and protocol that evokes and accommodates a wide range of responses and interpretations. We will show results that suggest that our population has a very difficult time applying measurement uncertainty and proportional reasoning, even after instruction designed to improve this group's understanding of these principles.

Haptic technology affords learners with kinesthetic movement and tactile sensation that can provide information about the morphology of an object or force and motion feedback. Previous research has shown that combining both visual and haptic activities can improve the performance of psychomotor skills. But less empirical studies have been done for conceptual learning. An atomic force microscope (AFM) is a tool that utilizes interatomic forces to detect the surface structure of a nanoscale sample and to investigate its properties at the nanoscale. In this exploratory study, we will investigate the effectiveness of haptic technology in teaching how nanoscale properties can be detected with the aid of an AFM. Data was collected via teachers reflection papers that were submitted at the end a two-week summer workshop.  A categorical analysis was performed to investigate in- and pre-service teachers experiences and initial impressions with the visuohaptic simulation, developed by our research team.

For introductory life science students, fluid dynamics is a topic that is important, relevant to biology, and yet difficult to understand conceptually. Our study focuses on probing understanding of pressure differentials, vacuums, and Bernoullis equation which underpin ideas of fluid flow. Data was collected from written assessments and laboratory exercises in addition to teaching interviews, and was analyzed using the frameworks of resource theory [Hammer 2000] and mechanistic reasoning [Russ 2008] to look for productive student ideas such as a microscopic viewpoint and gradient driven flow.  We investigated whether a multiple-scale view of matter is useful for students when constructing models of pressure and fluid flow and will present both our model and a qualitative analysis of student work.

In a previous article [1] we showed that the 20-item multiple choice Test of Understanding of Vectors (TUV) is a reliable assessment tool. In this work we present a classification of the most frequent incorrect answers for each of the items of the TUV. We administered the test to 423 students who were completing the required sequence of introductory physics courses at a large private Mexican university. First we analyzed the overall performance of the students and cluster the items according to level of difficulty. We then developed the classification categorizing the items in four groups by type of difficulty: (1) graphical properties, (2) graphical procedures, (3) geometric calculation procedures, and (4) unit vector notation calculation procedures. These analyses provide a general description of the difficulties that university students have when applying vector concepts and could guide the design of new instructional material intended to increase students understanding.

The academic ethics survey was designed to elicit self-reflection upon students own education standards, and expectations for their learning.  As iterations were developed to further elaborate upon students responses each semester, trends in attitudes towards learning, faculty, and other students collaborative habits began to emerge.  Individually resolved codes of conduct also emerged from these written responses, providing insight into students deliberation upon aspects of ethical concern as directly related to their engineering, physics, and chemistry fields of study.  This poster will divulge the common trends collected from four consecutive semesters of introductory engineering physics students, totaling approximately 270 students at Penn State Altoona.

An important part of introductory physics is learning the skill of sense-making, or what we call thinking like a physicist. The focus of this study was to identify the ways of thinking that introductory physics students engage in to make sense of physics ideas and problems. We then identified groups of students based on patterns of these sense-making activities. By coding several open-ended questions answered by the students (n=63) and performing a cluster analysis on the coded responses, we were able to find several distinguishable clusters of sense-makers. Interviews provided more details about some of the sense-making strategies reported by students. This study gives insight to student sense-making processes in an introductory physics course.

This poster will examine the difference in student performance between students attending lecture in person and students choosing to watch the lecture on video as part of an online class. The option to watch the lecture on video was implemented mid-semester in Fall 2012 allowing for a repeated measures experimental design. Students performance both on conceptual instruments and standard assignments is examined. Student engagement in the class is also characterized. While statistically significant differences in engagement and performance are found between students using no video and students making extensive use of video, these differences vanish when the engagement or performance pre-video is controlled for. Student interaction with the lecture is also investigated through the students taking of lecture notes; significant differences both pre and post video were found.

In physics and astronomy the low representation of women is apparent from undergraduate students to full professors. Women often experience chilly climates, discrimination, and challenges with work-life balance. In the literature exploring this topic, little focus is put on the experiences of graduate students. This project addresses this by using in-depth in-person interviews with graduate student women in astronomy and physics. In all there are 21 participants from three institutions of higher education. Results indicate that peer support and mentoring by faculty or post doctorate associates were critical for these womens success. Many of the women describe micro aggressions towards them because of their genders; in a few cases women experience overt sexual harassment and in one case physical danger. Largely, these women want to pursue non-academic or teaching-oriented academic professions which they perceive as being more accommodating to a work-life balance.

This poster will present the results of a study of student reflections from several project-based learning (PBL) courses at Creighton, including an upper-division quantum mechanics course and a freshman-level integrated calculus and physics course. Student reflections give interesting insights into areas of the course such student motivation, changes in students' epistemologies, teaming issues, and the effectiveness of the project-based pedagogy.  We will present several lessons learned from having students write frequent reflective essays, as well as discuss strategies for increasingly the usefulness of embedded reflection within the course.

Many course interventions in physics explicitly aim to improve students learning and often implicitly aim to improve students attitudes towards physics. In an introductory physics lab course, a course intervention was designed to give students more authentic experiences conducting physics experiments. To evaluate the students attitudes towards experimental physics, we analyzed students responses to the Colorado Learning and Attitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS) at the beginning and end of the one-semester course. We will compare responses from students in the intervention course to students in a more traditional one-semester physics lab course, looking at shifts across the semester as well as perceptions regarding the importance of various elements for succeeding in the course. These responses will also be compared across the explicit and implicit learning goals of the two lab courses to identify the impacts of these goals on student attitudes.

Certain classroom interactions may contribute to self-efficacyones confidence in one's ability to accomplish a certain task. Some of these interactions contribute to two sources of self-efficacy: verbal persuasion and vicarious learning (i.e. watching others with whom a person relates succeed or fail at a task). High self-efficacy has been shown to positively contribute to student performance and persistence in STEM courses and careers. In this poster, we relate students academic interactions and self-efficacy in introductory Modeling Instruction physics at Florida International Universitya large, Hispanic serving institution. Social network analysis (SNA) is used to calculate centralitya proxy for how ingrained a particular student is in the academic network of the classroom. A correlation is tested between students centrality and their participation in self-efficacy building activities, as measured by the Sources of Self-Efficacy in Science Courses survey.

UMd-PERGs NEXUS/Physics for Life Sciences laboratory curriculum, piloted in 2012-2013 in small test classes, has been implemented in large-enrollment environments at UMD in 2013-2014.  These labs address physical issues at biological scales using microscopy, image and video analysis, electrophoresis, and spectroscopy in an open, non-protocol-driven environment.  We have collected a wealth of data (surveys, video analysis, etc.) that enables us to get a sense of the students responses to this curriculum in a large-enrollment environment and with teaching assistants new to the labs.  In this poster, we will provide a broad overview of what we have learned and a comparison of our large-enrollment results to the results from our pilot study, published in the recent AJP special issue on the intersection between biology and physics (May 2014).  Special emphasis will be placed on successes and challenges accompanying this scaling-up.  (This work is supported by funding from HHMI and the NSF.)

One of the most challenging issues in discipline-based education research is the development of evidence-based analyses that integrate cognitive and sociocultural approaches to learning. Network Analysis is an approach that will allow us to investigate both cognitive networks and student interaction networks. The coordination of these networks has the potential to address the interplay between social and academic interactions and cognitive development in the learning endeavor.  For this poster we demonstrate how a concurrent analysis of both student interaction and cognitive networks proceeds. We provide preliminary results from analyses of a bipartite network of Force Concept Inventory responses and coordination of these cognitive networks with the social networks that emerge in an Introductory Physics Classes. The methodology is an intriguing development in educational research that couples analyses of cognitive and social learning.

In large introductory physics courses, Teaching Assistants (TAs) are the instructors with whom students most frequently interact. Consequently, it is essential that TAs receive appropriate training and preparation before they enter the classroom. In Fall 2013, the School of Physics at Georgia Tech began preparing its new TAs through a training and mentoring program that covers pedagogy, physics classroom issues, and career development strategies. Here we discuss the elements of our pilot training program, its effects on TAs' attitudes about teaching, and the modifications and improvements we will be implementing for the next cycle of new TAs in Fall 2014.

In addition to struggling with deep comprehension of physics concepts, students also struggle with essential, procedural skills that are necessary for the types of problem solving expected of them during introductory physics classes. Students in both semesters of calculus-based introductory physics have been shown to struggle with the essential skills of computing vector components and vector products. Following up on the AAPT presentation of the same title, this poster presents further data on the effectiveness of simple computer-based training with varying levels of answer-based feedback on student fluency with these vector skills. The effectiveness of this training is explored in depth, including an analysis of learning curves, timing data, measures of efficiency, longitudinal data, and comparisons with effects of instruction. In general, higher levels of feedback were more efficient for low-performing students, while high-performing students were able to make use of lower feedback levels.

This research investigates relationships between students understanding of force and motion as measured by the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) and their out-of-school engagement as measured by the Transformative Experience (TE) Survey. Surveys were administered in an introductory algebra-based physics course (N = 68 completely matched). Positive correlations are observed between students overall TE scores and FCI pre and post scores (r = 0.4, p < 0.005). Correlations between TE scores and FCI normalized gains, however, are not statistically different from zero. These preliminary results suggest that students with a better understanding of force and motion concepts may more readily transfer understanding outside of the class, but out-of-school engagement may not be contributing to further learning gains. We conclude with a discussion of how responses to individual statements on the TE survey vary between students in the top and bottom quartiles based on FCI performance.

The Physics Education Group at the University of Washington has been developing and testing Tutorials in Physics for use in upper-division courses on quantum mechanics.  Like Tutorials in Introductory Physics, they are intended to supplement instruction in lecture-based courses, with a focus on improving student conceptual understanding.  We describe the overall impact of the tutorials on student learning in a junior-level quantum mechanics sequence at the University of Washington.  Our findings indicate that students at all levels (by academic performance in the course) benefit from the use of tutorials.  Moreover, on course evaluations, students have overwhelmingly ranked the tutorials as being helpful to their learning, with the highest ratings coming from the highest performing students.

Prior work has shown that students exhibit a bias against female physics teachers by the beginning of college and are aware of and respond to societal stereotypes about their performance.  However, the effects of bias between peers have not been studied well, even though it may have a significant impact on the affective experiences and overall learning of physics.  In this poster, results of a preliminary experiment designed to examine students evaluations of the problem-solving abilities of purported peers are presented.  Students in an algebra-based introductory physics course were asked to assess handwritten solutions to a typical mechanics problem by providing a numerical score, a rationale for the score assigned, and an expected course grade for the solver.  We analyze the assessments for potential gender bias (including both the gender of the solver and that of the assessor), and study the criteria used by assessors in evaluating peers' abilities.

Complex reasoning and problem-solving are integral cognitive constructs relevant to understanding how students acquire critical thinking skills in physics. Functional magnetic resonance imaging may offer neurobiological insight into how these critical thinking skills are acquired. Prior work studying the neural correlates of problem-solving has focused within specific cognitive domains, e.g. mathematical calculation, verbal problem-solving, or visuospatial reasoning [1,2]. However, research identifying neural networks engaged during physics problem-solving is limited. We use the BrainMap database [3] to perform a series of neuroimaging meta-analyses across multiple distinct cognitive domains likely involved in physics problem-solving. Common activation patterns are observed in the bilateral insula, mid and superior frontal gyrus, and parietal cortices, suggesting that reasoning across domains is supported by a superordinate problem-solving network

The Dirac delta function is a standard mathematical tool used in multiple topical areas within the undergraduate physics curriculum.  While Dirac delta functions are often introduced in order to simplify a problem mathematically, students often struggle to manipulate and interpret them.  To better understand student difficulties with the delta function at the upper-division level, we examined responses to traditional exam questions and conducted think-aloud interviews.  Our analysis was guided by an analytical framework that focuses on how students activate, construct, execute, and reflect on the Dirac delta function in physics.  Here, we focus on student difficulties using the delta function to express charge distributions in the context of junior-level electrostatics.  Challenges include: invoking the delta function spontaneously, constructing two- and three-dimensional delta functions, integrating delta functions in different coordinate systems, and recognizing that the delta function has units.  We also discuss possible implications of these findings for instruction.

Communicating to non-expert audiences about advanced physics topics and current research is an essential practice for physicists. Typical language used by physicists speaking to other physicists, however, draws on a wealth of prior knowledge and community norms; using such scientific language with public audiences can be a barrier to effectively communication. Drawing from observations and literature, we present a framework for the assessment of scientific language of physicists communicating scientific meaning to non-expert audiences. We apply this framework to the analysis of videos of university physics students instructed to describe their research to middle school children. We classify the types of scientific language students use, such as physics-specific or general-science jargon, and also identify strategies students employ to mitigate the impact of jargon on the audience, including examples, explanations and analogies.

Scientific experiments, by their very nature, control conditions and variables with the goal of ensuring that what the experimenters think they are testing is what is actually being tested. However, we bring an intuition honed by real-world experiences, where myriad factors contribute to the behavior that we see. Bridging this gap can be a challenge both for learners and instructors. By utilizing a recently-developed wireless data acquisition system, the IOLab, for pre-lab experiences where students will gather data about real-world activities for which they have extensive personal intuition, we hope to reduce that challenge and provide a framework for students to engage in the scientific enterprise. By the end of the course, students will develop their own novel research activities and present their results to their classmates.

Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are well defined tools to develop specific units of learning. In the research field there exist different approaches and proposals, here we find the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools, these let to the teachers and instructional designers to develop Example-Tracing Tutors that focuses on the design and implementation of ITS for solving problems by students. In countries as the USA the development, implementation and research of these kinds of tutors is quite stable, reporting results that show the benefit of use them in the learning process. In Latin-America the use of ITS is practically unexplored, in present work we present the results of the design and implementation of ITS for learning the basic concepts of electric circuits with high-school students in a public school of Mexico. The results were analyzed with normalized gain and with concentration-factor graphs.

The use of computational modeling is fundamental to science and engineering. We present a cognitive model of apprenticeship combined with computational modeling as an alternate means for overcoming students conceptual difficulties. Learning principles implemented in this model include: types of knowledge required for expertise, ways to promote its development, sequencing of the learning activities, and the social characteristics of the learning environment. These contextual learning modules can supplement already established STEM curricula and are used to target difficult concepts. Students complete these two to three hour learning modules outside of class after they have attended lecture(s) over the concepts and completed a series of textbook problems. Assessment is performed by way of a rubric that is provided in advance at the end of the module as a reference. As an example, we present a series of modules that guides conceptual understanding in Engineering Statics.

The Japanese translation of the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) was evaluated using the classical test theory indices for its quality as a concept inventory. Based on a hypothesis that Japanese students and American students share similar concepts of motion and force, the item difficulty indices of the pretests of American students and Japanese students attending mid-level universities in their respective countries were compared. The indices indicated that the Japanese translation is of high quality and comparable to the original FCI (correlation coefficient between the two groups = 0.87). Because the results indicated that the Japanese translation of the FCI is of high quality, the Japanese data on the pretest and posttest scores were then analyzed to measure the efficacy of class instruction. The data analysis showed that the posttest scores of Japanese students depended primarily on their pretest scores and secondarily on class instruction but not on gender.

The acquisition metaphor of learning is often used by teachers of physics: Students acquire a particular concept and transfer this concept to new contexts. For example, one might argue that students acquire the mathematical concept of vector addition and apply it in different physical contexts. In this study, 200 freshmen taking an introductory physics course were asked to calculate total force, total displacement and total momentum in simple contexts involving vector addition at right angles. Another similar group of 200 students were asked to calculate net force, net displacement, and net momentum.  The students asked to calculate the net quantity did significantly better than the students asked to calculate the total quantity. The students did significantly worse when adding momenta (as opposed to adding forces or displacements). These results are inconsistent with a basic acquisitiontransfer perspective of learning. An analysis of subsequent interviews and questionnaires was also conducted.

In addition, I am exploring the ability to use a visual narrative to highlight common themes, narratives, and iconic problems shared among the courses.

Small Group Instructional Diagnoses (SGIDs) are informal, mid-semester evaluations of courses, which the instructors request voluntarily. The facilitator of the SGID comes into a class while the instructor leaves and spends about 30 minutes with the students.

The first part of the SGID is done in small groups of students. The facilitator asks students to consider two questions, "What are the strengths of this course?" and "What suggestions do you have to improve the course?" After students work in groups for 10 minutes to compose lists of strengths and suggestions, the facilitator calls the class back together as a whole, records the most important strengths and suggestions, and has the class vote on them. These results are then shared privately with the instructor of the course.

Student comments from 45 courses taught by 27 STEM instructors have been collected and analyzed and will be presented. These have implications for instruction.

Interactively engaging students can significantly help them understand key concepts [Hake 1998]. In PHYS 272 at Purdue University, we are experimenting with two methods of interactive engagement: introducing recitations with qualitative, tiered, iClicker questions and an open-ended laboratory where the students set up their own experiment.

A typical iClicker series has 3-5 questions and begins at a level where most students are confident in their answers. The series progresses to a point where most students have difficulty identifying the correct answer. Our goal is to demonstrate that these qualitative introductions coupled with quantitative collaborative work increases the students overall learning gain (measured by the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment). 

Separately, we are piloting an open-ended laboratory. The goal is to uncover the identity of 10 common circuit elements concealed in identical black boxes. The students can conduct any experiment using any of the equipment in the laboratory.

They have affordances far beyond those of other media for engaging, for persuading, and for educating. Scholars have noted that good video games are in fact carefully engineered learning machines, and that we in science education and the learning sciences have much to learn from game designers. One course of action is to use games to support or supplement instruction; another is to identify the fundamental principles and dynamics of game-based learning, and then investigate ways to incorporate those into non-game instruction. This targeted poster session will highlight a range of current efforts to improve physics instruction by studying or using games in creative ways.

The underrepresentation of women in physics has been a persistent issue for the physics community and, unlike many other science disciplines, continues to be so.  In this symposium, we will explore gender issues in introductory physics from several perspectives:  how pre-college experiences can influence women's persistence in physics in college, how reformed pedagogies may differentially affect the performance of women in physics classes as well as their performance in subsequent, advanced physics courses, and ways in which women's particularly poor physics identities may be impacted through deliberate classroom interventions.  The papers in this session employ several different methodologies including both qualitative approaches (e.g. case studies utilizing longitudinal interview data) and quantitative approaches (e.g. correlational, quasi-experimental, and experimental methods utilizing survey, conceptual inventory, and course performance data).

Competency-Based Assessment goes by many different names, such as Outcomes based Grading, or Mastery Learning, but it is the idea that is enticing.  Rather than assign a grade based upon performance on individual tasks, the learner instead must produce evidence that she or he has mastered a set of skills or concepts.  The purpose of this roundtable is to discuss these skills and concepts as they relate to a PER-based agenda.

Physics educators began flipping the classroom long before the approach was given a sleek new name.  We called it, for example, Workshop Physics, Physics by Inquiry, or Peer Instruction.  Yet in spite of the strong research behind these approaches and the breadth of materials available, most physics courses remain steadily on their feet.  Especially in regional comprehensive universities, class size and limited resources provide constraints that can be hard to envision away.

To facilitate the use of video game dynamics and learning principles in physics teaching, I offer a theoretical model that integrates ideas from a broad range of literature. The essence of game play is voluntary engagement with a succession of challenges, powered by four dynamical loops: exploratory learning, identity growth, intrinsic motivation through mastery, and adaptive game response. Game play is a co-construction of the game mechanics and player, and much of a game's power to engage and teach arises from five different types of human-computer "meld" that the player can experience. The model describes coarse- and fine-grained elements of the game mechanics and their interrelationships, and can be applied at four different levels: the micro-level game as a succession of interesting challenges, the macro-level game as a designed experience, and two meta-level games focused on extending or modifying game aspects and on social interactions surrounding it.

Scale-Up is a radical reform geared toward high levels of student engagement utilizing integrated lab-lecture in a redesigned room. The first Scale-Up course was taught in 1997. Since then Scale-Up as spread widely across many institutions and disciplines. A recent survey identified 314 departments at 189 institutions in 21 countries that report being influenced by or using some version of SCALE-UP style instruction. Departments represented many distinct disciplines. We are in the process of studying the dissemination of SCALE-UP though a social network analysis, surveys, interviews, and site visits. Research questions include: How has knowledge about SCALE-UP spread? What leads a department to consider, adopt, modify or abandon SCALE-UP? How does the method of learning about SCALE-UP and departmental factors impact how SCALE-UP is implemented? In this talk we report on findings to date from this project.

Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) present education researchers with a unique opportunity to do PER, develop educational resources, and compare pedagogies. The MOOC environment has several advantages: the opportunity to apply psychometric and machine learning analyses such as IRT, Hidden Markov Models, student habit clustering, etc. with a large sample size? the ability to do perform controlled experiments involving different instructional resources and pedagogies with minimum student pushback? access to detailed records of what resources students study and when, and a wide variation in demographics (e.g. 25% with a high school education or less and 25% who are physics teachers in the same MOOC). We will discuss the A/B experiments and instrument development we are performing in our summer MOOC: 8.MReVx Mechanics Review, on the edX platform, invite discussion, and hopefully recruit some future collaborators who can leverage our data analysis for doing their PER in our next MOOC at the AP-level.

What are important settings for making learners benefit from illustrations and animated visuals?

One aspect is that the learning content as such has to be considered. Here we focus on phenomena that are not visible with naked eyes. Pictures and animations (in combination with text and formulas) are used to illustrate relevant physical characteristics that cannot be seen in reality. Examples and classifications will be shown.

Another important aspect is to assist information processing using multimedia to offer interactive visualizations and to provide possibilities also for combinations with acoustic information. Results from a study with 99 students who worked with a multimedia learning environment will be discussed. Distinction should be made between knowledge that was primarily based on pictorial information or on text based information. The best results provided animations with spoken explanatory text where pictorial imagination is important for understanding. This was significant for all students, but especially fruitful for the not so capable students. Concerning abstract, text based information students with higher abilities profited from written text, while students with lower abilities (median split) gained better results with spoken text. 

These results relate to material explaining how infrared motion detectors and infrared thermometers work, and how Planck's law and infrared radiation can be made more familiar. Possibilities for transfer to other areas will also be discussed.

This study investigates differences in AP physics students' solutions to problems when creating them in traditional pencil and paper notebooks and in screencasts. The students' notebook and screencast solutions were examined for structural differences in their problem solving procedures and for correctness. These findings were combined with the examination of students' self-reports of behaviors and experiences while creating their solutions. Findings show that, within this classroom environment, students created more complete solutions to traditional physics problems and were more likely to get the correct answer when doing them on screencasts versus notebooks. Student surveys show that they felt more socially connected, increased authorship, and less frustration when creating solutions in their screencasts. Our findings suggest that the improvements in student work and increased social interactions were associated with the iPad-based screencasts acting as boundary objects, giving students the opportunities to creatively incorporate personally meaningful practices into their physics assignments.

If we throw students into an academic learning environment that has been designed on the basis of "good" computer game design, how can we help them to recognize and cope with the fact that they are no longer in a traditional academic setting? We will present the "expertise activity" that we implement at the beginning of every new physics class. We ask students to identify a field of expertise outside of their academic life. Computer gaming is frequently identified by students. We ask them to describe a learning cycle that they can show the rest of the class to describe how to become an expert in gaming. We will present qualitative data showing the productive learning attitudes that students activate when learning is placed in the context of computer games. We will discuss the power of having students construct analogies using source domains with which they are familiar.

Building up competence in planning, conducting, assessing and evaluating experiments and communicating their outcome are core competencies in most national curriculas. Grading a lab report gives only limited amount of information about how far this competencies have been developed in an individual. Tablet-PCs with their integrated cameras, internal and external measurement devices, and integrated video editing suites give the opportunity to create video lab reports that provide additional informations about student's experimental and presentation skills - while, possibly, leaving out other informations.

In a Design Based Research (DBR) Project targeted both at middle school and university students, we seek optimized processes to prepare for experimental labwork, building and testing factual knowledge, conduct and document experiments and store and grade electronic lab reports. Research methods include electronic pre/post testing with comparison groups, parttaking observation and guided interviews. Preliminary results show enhanced groupwork and a tendency to more theory-guided experimenting. Factual knowledge, on the other hand, needs still to enhanced e.g. by rigid pre-testing prior to the lab session.

In the framework of the Model of Educational Reconstruction we study the development of formal thinking starting from phenomena exploration. Research is focus on contributing to practice developing vertical coherent content related learning proposals by means of Design Based Research and on finding ways to offer opportunities for understanding and experience what physics is, what it deals with and how it works in operative way. The research is not only limited to those that function in practice, but integrate learning processes analysis. Empirical data analysis is carried out on three main research problems: 1) individual common sense perspective with which different phenomena are viewed and idea organization, in order to activate modeling perspective in phenomena interpretation, 2) the exploration of spontaneous reasoning and its evolution in relation to a series of problematic stimuli in specific situations, in order to formulate activity proposals, 3) recognizing the modalities for overcoming conceptual knots in the learning environment in order to reproduce these conditions. Three main aspects are studied: 1) object-models role in favoring the student's first interpretative steps, 2) ICT role in overcoming conceptual knots, 3) developing theoretical thought in an educational path concerning quantum mechanics.

In earlier work, we found that women who reported experiencing the "discussion of underrepresentation" in their high school physics classes were more likely to report a career interest in the physical sciences in college.  To explore this effect in more detail, we conducted two double-blind, random-assignment experiments on students enrolled in introductory, algebra-based college physics.  In the first, students were randomly assigned to read one of two short essays (one focused on the underrepresentation of women in physics, the other reporting on AMO physics research led by a woman) followed by a uniform set of reflection questions.  In the second, another cohort of students was primed on their beliefs about gender differences in physics before undergoing the same treatment (one of two essays and reflection questions).  In this paper, we compare the impacts on students' general science identity, physics identity, and performance gains on selected FMCE problems.

Prior research has emphasized the importance of early science experiences for engaging female students such that their science interests persist and they opt towards STEM careers in the future. However, this research is not specific to physics and the question of when and how female students become engaged with learning physics in ways that may lead to their persistence remains largely unexplored. Drawing on data from more than a thousand undergraduate women in physics who completed a survey as part of the application process for the Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics, we identify the important role that high school physics plays in attracting female students to physics careers. Drawing on longitudinal interview data from nine female students, we further explore the ways in which high school physics experiences can have a lasting impact, especially as these experiences become more temporally distant.

We describe the development of an introductory mechanics MOOC originating from content and pedagogy developed for a blended classroom. The content was created to support the implementation of MAPs pedagogy : Modeling Applied to Problem Solving. Using MAPS, students work in groups on multi concept problems during class,while online content is used to provide pre-requisite knowledge of MAPs before class, and to build problem solving skills after class where students choose their own path through homework presented in increasing levels of difficulty. The courses evolved to a MOOC that is advertised as a "Re-View for people with some background in introductory mechanics, attracting 20,000 registrants over the 3 offering from Spring 2012-Summer 2013. We describe the similarities and differences between the residential course and the MOOC offerings, including demographics, use of resources and student behaviour and engagement.

Inquiry into Radioactivity simulators scaffold learning by placing students inside virtual worlds open to exploration and experimentation, with no overt agenda. Game design considerations have influenced the IiR simulators in several ways. They compress time and space, and their appearance achieves a cinematic visual style that welcomes non-science oriented students. Their game-like behaviors encourage curiosity-driven exploration: surprising phenomena (such as ionization or radiation emission) are first seen unexpectedly. Students must figure out what they have just seen, and groups often dive unasked into investigations to make sense of what they have discovered. Like computer games, the simulators display behaviors based on a vision of how the world might be rather than on the real behaviors observed in laboratories. They also deliberately exclude visual elements that might lead to alternate interpretations. Artistic license is used to help students visualize and connect phenomena on wildly different size and time scales.

This presentation will focus on the curriculum development work that we have been doing with our algebra-based course sequence. LEAP* is guided by research on student learning of physics and builds on the work of the NSF supported project, Physics and Everyday Thinking (PET). Students work in groups to develop their understanding of various physics phenomena including forces, energy, electricity and magnetism, light and optics. Students utilize hands-on experiments and computer simulations to provide evidence to support their conceptual understanding. Traditional problem solving is scaffolded by using the S.E.N.S.E. problem solving strategy. An overview of the curriculum and assessment results will be presented.

Pictures, figures, charts, symbols or graphs present information in many different ways. However, there are also specific suitable working methods for using them and for activating effective mental processing of information. Otherwise they will not contribute to multiple knowledge representations.

The use of pictorial task exercises was tested in a quasi-experimental study. 177 students (9th graders) participated in the study. The influence of working with different representations on knowledge acquisition and on knowledge transfer was examined. Knowledge acquisition, knowledge transfer, cognitive activities, and motivation were measured in the three groups that worked with: (a) written task exercises, (b) pictorial exercises and (c) mixed exercises. 

This study was realized in a broader context of context oriented leaning with modern sensors, also to overcome inert knowledge. This context, the study, statistics and the findings will be discussed.

The topic of magnetism fascinates people already since 2000 years and has always been an inherent part of curricula in physics education. Based on the properties of static textbooks the dynamic processes of magnetism were excluded in the present models. This fact is a problem in the understanding of magnetic phenomena and the compatibility of existing models with current scientific research in physics. Such a dynamic model of magnetism could be provided with the help of a multimedia learning environment (iBook) and usage of scientific methods for the visualization of magnetism (MOKE, MFM) on school level. To identify essential properties of such model, the knowledge of physics teachers about magnetism and interesting applications of magnetism for school a questionnaire has been developed and a teacher survey has been conducted. Considering the results of this survey and notable perceptions of physics education research regarding the existing models a first prototype of multimedia textbook was developed.

The Georgia Tech blended introductory calculus-based mechanics course emphasizes scientific communication as one of its learning goals, and to that end, we gave our students a series of five peer-evaluation assignments intended to develop their abilities to present and evaluate scientific arguments. Within these assignments, we also assessed students' evaluation abilities by comparing their evaluations to a set of expert evaluations. This poster summarizes our development efforts and describes the changes we observed in student evaluation behavior.

I will present 12 years of experience of leading "Project laboratory" course for first and second year physics majors. The main goal of the course is to develop students' science competences and skills in situations that are close to working conditions of physicists. This goal is achieved by giving the students an opportunity to work in small groups on open ended practical problems. The work takes 9 hours of class time (and more hours outside of class) and is spread over three weeks. Students design/build their own equipment, plan their own investigations and interpret and explain collected data. I will discuss the logistical and technical aspects of the course (equipment, examples of project tasks, etc.) present the examples of projects that students completed and share students' perceptions of learning in the course as expressed in their course evaluations.

The FIU Science Collaborative is a four-year project to reform undergraduate science education at Florida International University, driving institutional change through community building and faculty development across multiple departments. Each year, a cohort of faculty scholars undertakes transformation of their courses to incorporate and assess active learning. Scholars engage with reform in a variety of ways, from adoption of published research-based materials to creation of their own. We discuss examples and the bridges between faculty developers, faculty, and science education researchers that foster successful change.

Helping students, especially non-science majors, develop an understanding of three aspects of science -- that scientific reasoning is not something that only certain people are capable of doing, that scientific theories are not "grown-up" hypotheses, and that all scientific findings are tentative -- is a difficult endeavor. Students have few, if any, experiences where they explicitly engage in formulating and testing hypotheses and building a model (theory) of a system. We have used reverse game play to put students into a situation where they have to carry out this program. The students are given the board, playing pieces, and several histories of two people playing an abstract strategy game. Their task, working in small groups, is to infer a model of the game, i.e., the starting positions, legal moves, how to win, etc. Preliminary investigations suggest that students have a tendency to generate vague and/or incomplete hypotheses through weak analysis.

Interactive simulations are popular pedagogical tools with wide use in lecture demonstrations and recitation activities. Here, we investigate what can happen when students use interactive simulations as part of small-group activities in a large-lecture setting. In one general chemistry class, the eighty students (organized into self-selected small groups) were given 10 minutes to explore the PhET simulation Molecule Polarity without instructions on how to interact with the simulation. During this exploration time, we collected simulation interaction data (student mouse clicks), audio recordings, and clicker question responses from all student groups. We found that students explored the simulation fully without instructions, engaged in predominately on-topic conversations during exploration, and found the simulation easy to use and helpful for their learning. Further discourse and interaction analysis of a subset of on-topic student discussions uncovered rich examples of mechanistic reasoning supported by the simulation.

Studio and SCALE-UP (developed at RPI and NCSU respectively) have a long history in PER and at the Colorado School of Mines. CSM has been using Studio methods continuously since 1997, when the physics department implemented pilot sections of introductory calculus-based mechanics. Since then, Studio at CSM has expanded steadily. As of 2014, all of Physics I & II and Biology I are taught via Studio, along with pilot sections of Probability & Statistics. There are discussions in place to spread Studio to several other courses in the near term, including upper-division physics. In this talk, we'll briefly review the overall structure of Studio and some relevant performance data. The remainder will focus on the actual spread of Studio at CSM, highlighting a number of problems and how they were overcome, and reporting on the personal experiences of many of the instructors involved.

Much time, money, and effort has been spent developing innovative teaching pedagogies. But, the majority of college instruction in physics fields is inconsistent with research-based recommendations. This project investigates the dissemination and implementation of research-based instruction by using a web survey to understand the spread of SCALE-UP (Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies). Responses from 659 people indicate that SCALE-UP is used at over 250 institutions worldwide and has also spread to disciplines beyond physics. Information about SCALE-UP has traveled through both formal and informal channels. Secondary sites frequently modify the original SCALE-UP model, which may impact the success of the implementation. According to the Diffusion of Innovations theory, the developer may need to change the message to continue increasing the number of sites beyond early adopters.

This study considers the impact of instructor on the gender gap in students' scores on the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) in Modeling Instruction (MI) courses at Florida International University (FIU). Earlier work has shown that MI had increased FCI scores overall when compared to traditional lecture courses; however, the gap between male and female students' scores in the MI courses increased over the course of the semester. Student data was collected from 600 students at FIU, over 19 semesters, with 11 different instructors. General Linear Regression was used to determine the significance of the student gender and instructor factors in predicting a student's FCI score post-instruction and the fraction of variance explained by these factors. Effect sizes were then calculated from the difference in female students' scores from male students' scores and compared between instructors.

Active-learning approaches to teaching introductory physics have been found to improve student performance and learning gains in those introductory subjects.  This study goes further by investigating student performance in upper level physics courses after having previously taken Modeling Instruction introductory physics courses at Florida International University. Student performance data were analyzed for academic years 2010-2013 in upper level courses including Modern Physics, Mechanics, Electromagnetism, and Quantum Mechanics. We compare how students who took traditional or Modeling Instruction introductory courses perform in these subsequent courses.  We also look for differential effects between men and women who had these two types of introductory experiences.  The implications of this work for our understanding of the impacts of active-learning experiences will be discussed.

To investigate the pedagogic potential of educational games, Georgetown University (GU) is implementing a rigorous instructional design process in which learning objectives are mapped to game actions/analytics and to research questions. The challenge for educational game design is to tap into games' pedagogical potential. Hoffman and Nadelson (2009) write, "Our evidence suggested that games are unlikely to fulfill instructional expectations unless a direct relationship exists between the game and the learning context." This game design process is being implemented at GU through a faculty gaming cohort and has been shown in a pilot project to produce a robust game design effective at achieving stated learning outcomes. We are gathering triangulated data sources to address: correlations between game play and learning outcomes, perceived helpfulness, and enjoyment and/or engagement when playing the game. This poster will detail the design process, its link to game theory, and preliminary findings.

This contribution proposes a iterative methodology for designing teaching-learning sequences. We will describe the didactical tools used in the design of the sequence which involve contributions from Physics Education research, STSE aspects and epistemological analysis of the contents of the school curriculum. In the presentation will be specified the methodology for the case of electromagnetic induction. This topic, in the usual teaching, is usually quickly analyzed, spending most of the time to solve problems in a more or less rote manner. However, Physics Education research has shown that the fundamental concepts of the electromagnetic induction theory are barely understood by students.

We have shown that there is learning in our MOOC both using pre/post testing and week to week ability analysis using Item Response Theory. The normalized gain is ~ 0.31, higher than traditional courses, but lower than most interactive courses. Students with lower initial skill, less educational attainment, or weak preparation in physics and math learn as much as other students. We observe correlations with time spent on different resources and also observe different learning habits of students showing relative improvement vs. those with relative decline over the course.

At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill we have been teaching one reformed section of calculus-based introductory physics using the SCALE-UP (Student Centered Active Learning Environment for Upside-down Pedagogies) methodology since fall 2010. While the pilot study proved successful, we were unable to take the next step of "scaling up" to use this approach for all students. Beginning fall 2013 we adopted a Lecture/Studio methodology -- a hybrid of traditional and interactive engagement -- for all students. In this approach, students have one hour of lecture and two hours of studio twice per week. In this fashion we were able to offer large lecture sections for efficiency, but retain smaller, more intimate studios for hands-on, minds-on problem-solving and laboratory activities. How we got to where we are today, and the lessons learned along the way, will be discussed.

Online environments produce large corpuses of Big Data which researchers can use to analyze user interaction. In MOOCs, students' use of videos, written text (forums, assignments, etc.), social interactions, quizzes, and exams are all instantly recorded and can be used to provide real-time feedback to instructors. On-�campus instructors using MOOC materials in their courses can also use these analytics tools to inform instruction in their own classrooms. At Georgia Tech, we have taken an in-�depth look at how students engage video lectures in a flipped/blended introductory physics course. We describe the physics content students appear to attend to based on their play, pause, and seeking behavior while watching videos.

We report on two projects. First, the 8.MReV xMOOC is a course in mechanics, covering the same material as the MIT freshman physics course. Over its past iterations, over 25% of the students have been teachers.  A special discussion section allows teachers to discuss pedagogies for teaching each chapters material, and CEU credits are given. Second, we report on a recent short pilot of a hybrid cMOOC/xMOOC, called Maker Physics. It introduced participants to specific points of pedagogy, developed their comfort level with the EdX.org platform and encouraged the creation of physics content. Two working groups showed community style interactions during the creation of over 50 educational resources, although the pilot did not develop a course�-wide community. The course revealed a lack of shared premises and vocabulary between different areas of the educational community and began work on a shared discourse that could be the foundation of future collaborative models. Second, we found several places where both the technology and the pedagogy of the course needed smoother on-�ramps for students.

Visualization and geometric reasoning are key components of solving problems in science.  However, students often struggle to develop these skills in higher dimensional settings.  Weve developed clear plastic surfaces with a dry-erase finish which let students discover key relationships between mathematical concepts in the multivariable setting.  Participants in this workshop will have an opportunity to play, draw, and make measurements on the surface manipulatives.  In addition to sharing how we use the materials to help students understand the geometry behind ideas like gradient, partial and directional derivatives, level curves, and various forms of integrals, we will spend significant time exploring and discussing how these surface manipulatives could be utilized in the physics classroom.

With the advent of high-level programming languages capable of quickly rendering three-dimensional simulations, the inclusion of computers as a learning tool in the classroom has become more prevalent.  Although work has begun to study the patterns seen in implementing and assessing computation in introductory physics, more insight is needed to understand the observed effects of blending computation with physics in a group setting.  In a newly adopted format of introductory calculus-based mechanics, called Projects and Practices in Physics, groups of students work on short modeling projects  which make use of a novel inquiry-based approach  to develop their understanding of both physics content and practice.  Preliminary analyses of observational data of groups engaging with computation, coupled with synchronized computer screencast, has revealed a unique group interaction afforded by the practices specific to computational physics  problem debugging.

Students often leave Introductory Physics for Life Science (ILPS) courses without the understanding of real# fluid dynamics, which is necessary for them to be successful in their future biology courses.  In an effort to reconcile this issue, researchers at UNE have focused on improving students understanding of the circulatory system. This requires students to apply multiple fluid dynamics concepts, specifically: conservation of mass, Bernoulli's principle and the Hagen-Poiseuille's law.  After interviewing a number of students during the past four years, the researchers developed a kinesthetic circulatory system model made of transparent plastic tubing of different radii and branched connectors.  This model enabled students to see the fluid travel at different speeds (visually) and different pressures (using digital pressure sensors) similar to the cardiovascular system.  Evaluation of this learning module indicates substantial improvement in student understanding and appreciation of real fluid dynamics concepts.

In this presentation, I would like to discuss the various aspects of establishing a contemporary and low-cost University physics laboratory in the developing world. In particular, the process of laboratory development requires various fine balancing acts. First, indigenization based on locally available resources is to be balanced with the importation of technology. The latter is not only costly but one has to also face bureaucratic import rules and the unwillingness of foreign companies to deal with particular developing countries. Second, there is a cultural philosophy prevalent in many Asian countries of considering experiments a handmaiden to theory. Therefore, laboratory courses are mostly always tied up as "parasites" to theory courses. Third, there are various internal pressures and conflicting demands imposed by the local University administration. For example, development of laboratory is considered to be inferior to classroom teaching or doing "elite" physics. I will present the example of the Physics Laboratory at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) where all of these challenges, arguably, have been successfully addressed.

As part of a larger project we analyze think aloud data to produce descriptions of thinking.  This analysis requires inferring thinking from observable participant behaviors, primarily what participants say.  To produce rich and reasonably accurate descriptions of the thinking we focus on several different features in the data. We analyze the participants speech for both their description of their thinking and the insight provided into their context dependent expectations.  We also attend to two non-verbal features in the data, gestures and pauses. In this paper we focus on each analytic feature, first describing the relevant research base and then explaining how we operationalize it in our analyses.  We tentatively claim that coordinating the analyses of the four features produces more accurate descriptions of reasoning than traditional think-aloud analysis methods, which focus primarily on analyzing speech.

In two consecutive semesters of a second semester algebra-based introductory physics course in which elements of Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) philosophy have been implemented, we gave students a series of survey questions to measure whether they had a transformative experience in learning about optics. We compared each students transformative experience (TE) score to their success in different aspects of the class. We discovered interesting data patterns and gender differences in terms of how students TE scores were related to their success in the course. In an effort to explain these patterns and differences, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis on the survey to investigate the underlying relationship between survey questions and to identify unobservable variables in the survey.

We present a network analysis from a newly developed survey of upper division physics students. This survey is part of an overall project focused on understanding student retention and persistence. The theory underlying this work is that social and academic integration are essential components to supporting students continued enrollment and ultimately graduation. This work uses network analysis as a way to investigate the role of social and academic interactions in retention and persistence decisions. In network analysis, students' social and/or academic interactions, along with demographic variables and student attributes, are used to test hypotheses about outcome variables. We focus on how student interactions with peers and with physics department faculty influence persistence. Our results, which are preliminary, will help frame the ongoing research project and identify ways in which departments can support students.

The American Physical Society recently released a statement calling on all university physics departments to provide all undergraduate students with access to research experiences. In response, we investigated the current status of access to undergraduate research at CU-Boulder, a large research institution where the number of undergraduate physics majors outnumber faculty by roughly ten to one. We created and administered two surveys within CU-Boulder's Physics Department: one probed undergraduate students' familiarity with, and participation in, research; the other probed faculty members experiences as research mentors to undergraduates. We describe the development of these instruments, our results, and our corresponding evidence-based recommendations for improving local access to undergraduate research experiences. We further present suggestions for how this process could be adapted for use in other departments.

The physics classroom provides an excellent opportunity for students to comprehend global sustainability issues and simultaneously be empowered by their science learning.  Drawing on data from a large national survey study of college students about their high school science experiences, we compare how frequently sustainability topics (e.g. energy supply, energy demand, climate change, water supply) are covered in high school physics versus other science courses.  Furthermore, employing science agency and physics identity theoretical perspectives, we examine whether the inclusion of sustainability topics has an effect on students science agency beliefs or their physics identities while controlling for demographics and other background variables.  
Our results indicate that physics classes are reported to cover sustainability topics less frequently than other science courses.  In addition, the inclusion of certain topics (e.g. energy supply) has a significant effect on students science agency beliefs and physics identity.

Students struggle with both a conceptual understanding and the mathematical application of Kirchoffs Voltage Law (KVL). The highly abstract nature of potential and electricity creates difficulties in students differentiating between and simply understanding such topics as charge, current, potential difference, and power. I have developed a diagram that builds conceptual understanding of potential and potential difference and also aids in generating a system of equations adhering to KVL. The diagram relates electric potential to a position along the circuit and incorporates all loops within that circuit on a single diagram.  Though this work is in its initial phases in a high school classroom it has favorable results with students.

A recent study of students in a calculus-based introductory physics course found that students performed significantly better on vector addition and subtraction tasks when the questions were given using the ijk representation instead of an ``arrows-on-a-grid'' representation.  This study also presented evidence that working knowledge of the ijk format was necessary to correctly perform vector operations in the arrow format, which has implications for instruction at the algebra level, as many courses and texts exclusively use the arrow format and neglect the ijk format.  We conducted a study of students in an algebra-based introductory physics course where students were given no explicit instruction on the ijk format, but had received instruction on the arrow format.  We find that the algebra-based students perform significantly higher in the ijk representation than the arrow representation in both one- and two-dimensional problems.  Our findings imply that algebra-based students would also benefit from ijk instruction.

As physics teachers know, even the best students often master the ability to solve quantitative problems, but nonetheless dont understand basic physics concepts. To address this problem, we developed Rimac, a tutoring system that engages students in natural-language dialogues about the concepts associated with just-solved problems.  Rimacs dialogues implement empirically-derived principles to guide the tutor in asking questions about the concepts associated with a problem, and the tutors feedback on students responses.  These principles stem from our extensive analyses of tutoring sessions between human physics teachers and students.  We describe a recent study that compared two versions of Rimac in high school physics classrooms: an experimental version that deliberately executes the tutoring principles and a control version that does not, but implements prior state-of-the-art dialogue generation practices.  Although students learned from both versions of the tutor, the experimental group outperformed the control group and was especially beneficial for female students.

This past academic year my department implemented a new series of required upper-division, one-credit physics courses: Investigations in Physics I and II. The purpose of this two-course sequence is to provide our majors opportunities to propose their own questions and have a full term to explore that question. During the once-per-week, hour-long meeting time, the individual students provided progress reports and set goals for the following week. Students grades in the course were based on how well they stay focused on their Investigation question, the extent to which they analyzed their question, a progress report and final paper, and an oral presentation to the class. In this poster, I will describe the details of the course and my interactions with the students, specific Investigation questions proposed by students, and implementation challenges faced this past year.

Student evaluations are an important part of tenure and promotion processes, and gender (or other) biases can have devastating consequences. We are analyzing ten years of student evaluations for faculty in five College of Science departments: math, physics, biology chemistry and imaging science. Our categorization rubric consists of seven categories spanning scholarship, organization/clarity, instructor-group interaction, instructor-individual student interaction, dynamism/enthusiasm, specificity and affect. Each category contains multiple positive and negative sub-categories, with statements coded into as many sub-categories as apply. (For example, positive sub-categories in scholarship include knowledgeable, challenging, professionalism, and articulate; negative sub-categories includes: too hard, unchallenging, opinionated, and unprofessional.)  This poster presents preliminary findings about frequency of comment types and differences between disciplines and faculty gender.

Synthesis problems represent a unique challenge for students by requiring multiple physics concepts. In this study, we compared the effect of two types of intervention on subsequent student performance with a target synthesis problem. Students either solved two single-concept problems (priming) or compared worked solutions across one of four different analogical reasoning conditions. These four conditions varied according to the type of examples compared (single concept vs. synthesis) and structural similarity to the target problem (near vs. far). Taken together, the analogical reasoning conditions had a significant effect (d=0.31) over control. However, there were no significant differences between the different analogical reasoning conditions, or between analogical reasoning and priming.  Although student responses on the target synthesis problem were similar across conditions, their responses  to the analogical reasoning tasks showed potentially useful differences in referenced physics concepts and response grain size, from generic to more precise.

The students taking the introductory physics course at Mercy College are all preparing for a future in the health or life sciences.  There has been an ongoing effort to create a physics curricular experience that will enable these students to develop inquiry about the physical mechanisms underlying living processes and be able to use models to answer their own authentic questions.  Student homework and individual final projects, both allowed students to investigate what was interesting to them, but this individuality in assignments also made development of an competence assessment instrument challenging.   The latest version of the master rubric will be shown, with examples of student work exemplifying the different levels of achievement in the different categories of physics competency.   Results also how where further curricular improvements need to be made.

We review findings from the first four years of running a Learning Assistant (LA) program [1] at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). At UMCP, LAs have supported educational transformation efforts across 12 different science courses and engaged 22 different instructors in research-based educational practices.  In assessing the impact of this program on LAs, we have replicated CU-Boulders finding that LAs conceptual understanding is improved through participation in the LA program (~10% average absolute gain on FMCE[2]) [3]. We are investigating the longitudinal impacts of the LA experience on LAs and how our LA program may be cultivating change agents.  We find that many of our former LAs continue to be involved in some teaching and work to change how learning environments are structured.  LAs also report that their experiences in the program were transformative for the ways that they thought about teaching and learning science.

We consider reflection a retrospective form of metacognition in which the learner retraces how she or he came to understand a concept. Reflection is not only likely to be important for independent learning, but also would seem to be a valuable prerequisite for teachers seeking to gauge and guide the learning of their students.  But how accurate are learners in identifying changes in their own thinking? We have been examining student reflection in a Physics and Everyday Thinking course for preservice teachers. An assessment question involving Newtons 2nd law was administered just before a relevant class activity, and then again afterwards, about two weeks later. The re-assessment included a prompt asking students to describe how their thinking had changed. We code responses to evaluate students physics content accuracy, and compare pre/post differences to the students' self-reported reflections.  Preliminary findings will be shared.

We present an experiment in which subjects with differing levels of physics experience were timed in their ability to detect small changes in nearly identical pairs of diagrams that are representative of typical introductory physics situations. It was hypothesized that higher physics expertise would guide attention and result in faster detection times for those changes that affected the physics, whereas no expertise advantage in detection times would result for changes that did not affect the physics.  Our findings partially confirmed the hypothesis. We present results on how the response time for noticing physics-relevant changes in the diagram pairs is faster than for physics-irrelevant changes for those with more extensive physics experience and slower for those with less extensive physics experience. We discuss the cognitive implications of our findings.

Biological and health care majors comprise one of the largest populations of students enrolled in physics courses each year. Because of this, there is a growing interest within the physics and biology communities to restructure the introductory physics courses for life science majors to better support the needs of these students. In this context, computational modeling could prove to be an accessible and compelling tool for exploring biologically and medically relevant phenomena, such as diffusion, within in the physics course. As a first step leading to implementation, we conducted an exploratory study to help us learn about life-science majors' attitudes towards programming. Our observations suggest that these students had an apprehension towards programming but at the same time held a positive attitude towards data tables, which can be used to scaffold more rigorous computational modeling tasks in the classroom.

A pilot algebra-based introductory physics course for pre-health and life science majors was designed to highlight the relevance physics will have on students future careers. This was done through the use of biomedically inspired content and video interviews with biomedical experts delivered via the multimedia tool the smartPhysics Framework.  We will present the results of an assessment of the attitudinal shifts of the students using the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS). Studies shows that nearly all university level courses lead to shifts away from expert-like thinking/attitudes and toward novice-like thinking/attitudes. Our results will be compared to the attitudinal shifts of students enrolled in the concurrent traditionally taught algebra-based physics course and the shifts across the first two quarters of the three term introductory sequence. The results show a number of large favorable trends for students taking the pilot course that focuses on biomedical equipment.

An accurate, nuanced capturing and characterization of student/teacher behavior inside and outside the classroom is a necessity in todays education reform. In this paper, a new framework, called the BIAR (Beliefs, Intentions, Actions, and Reflections) Student-Teacher Interaction Model, is introduced. This tool incorporates the use of TDOP (Teaching Dimensions Observation Protocol) in classroom observations alongside student/faculty interviews, stimulated recall sessions, and electronic surveys. Once gathered, the data can be compared and rated for their degree of correlation. While the work in this project wasnt aimed at making any specific claims about the practices of teachers or students, the introduction of the BIAR Model provides a structure for future work in this area.

The context for our study is a first-year Physics course. While the course takes place in Canada, all students are international, and this is their first year in an English-speaking institution. Students received pre-class assignments, using a combination of textbook reading and PhET activities, to prepare them for the interactive engagement lectures. The given activities asked students to explore key concepts in the target domain and reflect on their exploration. Results show that students engaged with the simulations productively, even in a homework setting without instructor support. Furthermore, short interaction with the sim was sufficient to improve students performance from pre- to post-test. Students attitudes toward exploration remained remarkably stable from the first time that they engaged with one of these combined textbook and PhET pre-class assignments to the second one a couple of months later.

The CSU S-STEM Program supported by the National Science Foundation seeks to increase the educational attainment of CSU students and encourage more students to think of themselves as scientists.  Chemistry and Physics Majors in the S-STEM Program receive tuition support at CSU, engage in a summer program based on the University of California-Berkeley Compass Project, participate in early research experiences during their first year at CSU, and engage in a peer and faculty mentoring program.  Students also receive funding to support travel to attend conferences and present research and explore graduate programs, teaching careers, and careers in scientific research.  An emphasis on the development of community, in addition to academic and scientific support, are essential elements of the CSU S-STEM Program and build on the resources of our students who mainly come from neighborhoods on the southside of Chicago.

In a study on student understanding of graphical representations of work, students in introductory calculus-based physics were presented with a force-position graph (F-x) that showed two different mechanical processes with identical initial and identical final values for force and position.  The task, to compare the works done in each case, was administered at three points along the two-semester instructional sequence to probe differences in student responses and reasoning and compare findings to results from analogous questions in thermodynamics. Response prevalence varied little across administrations; however, the reasoning students used showed variation.  Analysis of reasoning used showed a higher use of area under the curve for a correct response, and a more prevalent invocation of path independence or conservative forces for the major incorrect interpretation, with instruction.  These findings support earlier speculation that thermodynamics students associate work with conservative forces due to introductory instruction.

We discover pairs of questions (items) that students answer in a dependent manner by applying Fishers Exact Test to a sample of 1080 students answering 257 items in the MOOC 8MReVx. To eliminate false positives arising from the large range of student abilities, we divided students into groups of similar ability by: 1) similar percentage correct on first try (CFT) of all available problems, 2) similar percentage CFT of problems attempted, and 3) similar skills determined by Item Response Theory. All three methods dramatically reduce the number of false dependencies in a similar fashion. Importantly, using 5 groups 70% (vs. 5% without groups) of dependent pairs of items have identical ratings in all four categories of the Taxonomy of Introductory Physics Problems, 70% (vs. 23%) are of the same pedagogical type, 45% (vs. <1%) are items in the same problem, and 100% (vs. 12%) reside in the same course Chapter.

While the STEM education community has developed many new pedagogies and materials, not many have been successful in reaching a wide audience. This study is part of an effort to understand how new pedagogies and materials can become widely used, by learning about those that have become well-propagated. Experts across STEM disciplines were asked to identify well-propagated instructional strategies and materials in their disciplines. We created a categorization scheme to describe the innovations and gathered evidence to evaluate the extent to which the innovations they suggested had propagated. This poster will discuss the general characteristics of well-propagated instructional strategies and materials. We describe the strategies and materials in terms of the type of innovation they represent (a change in pedagogy, content, both, neither) and found the majority represent a change in pedagogy, and those associated with a research group have been funded for a period ten years or more.

This experiment is part of a series of studies to improve the efficacy of online physics homework activities by integrating narrated animated solutions with mastery inspired exercises. In a clinical study using first and second-year university students, the mastery group attempted question sets in four levels, with animated solutions between each attempt, until mastery was achieved on each level. This combined elements of formative assessment, the worked example effect, and mastery learning. The homework group attempted questions with immediate feedback and unlimited tries. The two groups took a similar amount of time to complete the activity. The mastery group significantly outperformed the homework group on a free response post-test that required students to show their work in solving near and far transfer problems.

In a two-phase exam, students take the exam twice: once individually, and a second time working in teams. Proponents of such exams hope that during the team phase, students will meaningfully discuss questions they disagreed upon during the individual phase by sharing their reasoning, challenging each other, and reaching consensus. Proponents fear that students will uncritically adopt the majority answer or follow the team member they perceive as best. To investigate the preponderance of these behaviors, we use students' individual- and team-phase responses from the final exams of four different introductory physics courses to infer teams' answer-selection dynamics. We also characterize individual- to team-phase improvement rates and identify factors that correlate with improvement. Our particular two-phase exam implementation is especially conducive to analysis because it encourages but does not require teams to agree on a common answer, and allows students to signal uncertainty by "hedging their bets" for partial credit.

We have developed  taxonomies of alternate conceptions concerning buoyancy and density, and we are investigating the prevalence of many of those conceptions in the college student population at Grove City College (GCC) and other collaborating institutions.  We conducted interviews with fourteen GCC students during the 2013-2014 academic year.  Additionally, students at GCC and collaborating institutions completed a Likert-style conception survey probing agreement with selected conceptions.  This poster will present preliminary data from the interviews and conception surveys.

Student-to-student interactions are foundational to many active learning environments, but are most often studied using qualitative methods. Network analysis tools provide a quantitative complement to this picture, allowing researchers to describe the social interactions of whole classrooms as systems. Past results from introductory physics courses have suggested a sharp division in the formation of social structure between large lecture sections and small studio classroom environments. Extending those results, this study focuses on calculus-based introductory physics courses at a large public university with a heavily commuter and nontraditional student population. I use community detection network methods to characterize pre- and post-course collaborative structure in several sections and consider differences between small and large classes. I will compare these results with expectations from earlier findings, and comment on implications for instruction and further study.

This study investigates the impact of changing two aspects of a traditional physics I lab on student attitudes and retention.  First of all, the labs were changed from cook book  style labs where students were told exactly what to do in each step of the lab to inquiry labs where students were asked to determine the best way to approach solving a problem with the given equipment.  The second change involved using more basic equipment such as stop watches and meter sticks instead of the more complicated equipment normally used in physics I labs.  It was theorized that students would understand the physics behind the labs more clearly if they did not have to spend a large portion of the lab learning to use the equipment and getting it to work correctly.  This study involves three physics I labs taught by the same professor during the summer of 2013.  Two of the classes were taught using the standard lab book and equipment.  The third class was taught using different labs with different equipment to teach the same physics concepts.  We found that students enjoyed the inquiry labs more and looked forward to the next assignment.  Furthermore students spent less time getting the equipment to work and more time learning the physics concepts.

The language used to describe concepts related to energy within the disciplines of physics and chemistry was interpreted in terms of the common definitions and ontologies of energy.  Experts and novices in both domains were asked to define energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy as part of a larger semi-structured interview on energy.  The provided responses were coded and analyzed based on definition and ontology to determine consistency.   In general, a range of views on energy was seen, with experts using multiple definitions and ontologies.  These are preliminary results related to a larger study looking at the compartmentalization of energy concepts between the domains of chemistry and physics.

Computation, the use of a computer to solve, simulate, or visualize a physical problem, has revolutionized how physics research is done. Computation is used widely to model systems, to simulate experiments, and to analyze data. Yet, in most undergraduate programs, students have little formal opportunity to engage with computation and, thus, are left to their own to develop their computational expertise. As part of a larger project to study how computation is incorporated in some undergraduate physics programs (and how it might be further incorporated), we have conducted a series of interviews with industry professionals, academic faculty, and employed bachelor's graduates who make use of computation in their everyday work. We present results from these interviews that speak to how interview participants developed the requisite skills to do professional computational work and what skills they perceive are necessary to conduct such work. The research is funded by NSF DUE 1431776.

Undergraduate Research is a significant way to foster students more central participation in physics. We present a potential mechanism by which research experiences may impact undergraduate participation: changes in their beliefs about the nature of science coupled to changes in a sense of ability to contribute to authentic research. Students in the study were part of a research seminar at the University of Maryland in which they worked with faculty and graduate student research mentors on research projects.  In videotaped interviews and classroom discussions, we asked students to describe their experiences in research. Students developed nuanced views about how the research process works. They also perceive shifts in their sense of access to research, feeling like their contributions as novices mattered.

Research has shown that an Interactive-Learning-Environment (ILE) can be an effective learning environment for acquiring transferrable knowledge. Our research analyzed the relationship between students participation in different areas of two consecutive ILE physics classes that implemented the Investigative-Science-Learning-Environment (ISLE) curriculum, a type of widely used ILE, and their ability to learn new physics through teamwork. We quantified students participation in two areas: in-class learning-activities and class review sessions. To measure students ability to learn through teamwork, we gave them group exams that presented real life scenarios that could only be understood using physics they had not yet learned. We then gave them standard physics problems related to the group exam problems to solve individually. Our results suggest that successful students built an effective habit of teamwork learning through participating in group learning activities, whereas students who were disengaged in review did not perform well in these teamwork learning activities.

Teachers discussing pedagogical strategies to help students with an incorrect idea about potential energy expressed contradictory goals for their teaching. Initially, teachers wished to avoid being overly complicated in their teaching, for example by asking students to stick to naming the forms of energy in the system and principles like the law of conservation of energy. But, the teachers conversation about a proposed simple pedagogical strategy showed an interest in mechanism  as well as an operational use of energy transformations and conservation. Later on, teachers recognized that students might also engage in and have good ideas about more complex ideas in class. Thus, the desire for keeping instruction simple was contradicted both by an awareness that a simple situation required a complex description and by the recognition that students were capable of more complex analysis, even if it interfered with the goals of simple instruction.

Studies show that students solve problems differently if they are posed verbally or graphically [1]. Similarly, class average scores on the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE) often differ for questions involving verbal statements about forces and those involving graphs of force over time [2]. We expand on this work by examining individual students responses to two question clusters on the FMCE (Force Sled and Force Graphs [2]) and seeking correlations between student use of both correct and common incorrect models. Data are drawn from pre- and post-instruction surveys at several institutions, including a four-year research-intensive university and a two-year college.

Student learning in instructional physics labs is a growing area of research that includes studies exploring students' beliefs and expectations about experimental physics.  To directly probe students' epistemologies about experimental physics and support broader lab transformation efforts both at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) and nationally, we developed the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS).  Previous work focused on establishing the accuracy and clarity of the instrument through student interviews and preliminary testing.  Ongoing validation efforts include establishing the extent to which student epistemologies as measured by E-CLASS align with other measures of student learning outcomes (e.g., course grades).  Here, we report on the correlations between final course grades and E-CLASS scores from two semesters of introductory and upper-division lab courses at CU and discuss implications of our findings for the validity of the E-CLASS instrument.

We describe a new type of faculty working group, a Department Action Team (DAT), that forms one component of a larger strategy towards enacting cultural change in higher education. DATs empower a team of faculty members within a single department to make focused, sustainable change in their department. DATs focus on departmental development, as faculty design and implement strategies to address an educational problem of mutual interest and broad-scale importance (rather than trying to solve the problem themselves). This contrasts other faculty development efforts like Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs), which support the individual development of faculty from different departments through reflection on separate education projects. We contextualize the DAT model through a case study of a group within a physics department that is focused on improving gender equity among their undergraduate majors. Building on this case, we offer general principles for facilitating and developing similar groups at other institutions.

Although the number of students earning bachelors degrees in physics has increased, the percentage of those degrees earned by women has not increased for more than 10 years. We use a physics identity framework to understand the factors that may impact physics career choice. Physics identity consists of three dimensions: recognition (perception of recognition by others), interest (desire to learn more), and performance/competence (perception of ability to understand). Our previous work has shown that recognition and interest are more significant predictors of physics career choice than performance/competence, and that women may require more recognition than men in order to choose physics careers. Therefore, teaching strategies that specifically target recognition and interest should be identified. Using data from a survey administered to a nationally representative sample of college students, we use regression models to determine which teaching strategies predict recognition and which strategies predict interest.

Think back to your undergraduate experience: did you ever take a class where you had to craft a definition from the ground up? Many people would answer, no, and yet, crafting definitions is an important skill across the STEM disciplines. There is also evidence that when students are handed definitions, they struggle to use them and sometimes even outright reject them as useful. I describe one promising definition-crafting activity for college physics students. I also propose a new construct: Definitional Ownership. I outline what strands might be important to this construct. I then focus methodologically on one strand of Definitional Ownership: the extent to which students actually use the words and phrases in their definitions in practice. The methodology is constructed for use on video data. It also focuses on definitions that are written in words and that have a purpose of helping their user in categorizing examples.

Testing claims and models is a central part of scientific activity.  Therefore, to help students better experience and understand science it is important to repeatedly engage them in the act of testing.  Here, roughly 40 students in an undergraduate algebra-based introductory physics course were introduced to the concept of Bayesian learning at the beginning of the semester.  A series of in-class activities were developed which asked students to try solving an end-of-chapter problem, then to evaluate their solution by conducting a special-case analysis, and then to update their subjective confidence in their solution using Bayes Theorem.  A set of lab activities were also designed to incorporate the use of Bayes Theorem when updating student confidence in physical models after conducting testing experiments.  The design of these activities will be discussed, as well as student performance on the activities and the observed relationship to performance on EBAPS and CLASS.

Learning quantum mechanics is challenging even for upper-level undergraduate students and graduate students. Interactive tutorials that build on students prior knowledge can be effective tools to enhance student learning. We have been investigating student difficulties with the quantum mechanics behind the double-slit experiment and have developed a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial (QuILT) that makes use of a simulation to improve their understanding. We describe the common student difficulties with the double slit experiment and the extent to which the QuILT was effective in addressing these difficulties.

By using the resource-based model of cognition, physics education researchers have been able to develop a more complete understanding of the fine-grained details of students reasoning. Many studies that use the resource-based model of cognition derive their findings from strictly qualitative analyses of data. These studies have been invaluable; however the qualitative nature of these studies limits the scope of knowledge that we can gain by using the resource-based model of cognition. By using mixed methods of data analysis we can discover and communicate patterns that we would be unable to if we limited our analysis to strictly qualitative methods. In order for a mixed methods approach to be viable, we must develop reliable coding schemes for identifying resources. In this poster, we present a coding scheme, and the associated reliability measures, that we developed for identifying resources.

While the goals for instructional labs have been highly debated, inquiry- and skills-driven labs can lead to significant gains in students' scientific and experimentation abilities. A simple scaffold for introductory labs uses iterative cycles of comparisons to develop students' epistemologies, experimentation behaviours, and critical thinking abilities. By focusing the iterations on improving measurements, students explore the limits of physical models in the real world and engage in the evaluation and refinement of these models. In a controlled research study, students adopted these behaviours and continued to use them even after instruction to do so had been removed.

At Texas State University, we have been implementing many research-based curricula in our introductory physics classes, and have developed a survey to assess the degree of Transformative Experience(1) in our students. The survey contains 29 items, and was modeled after one used by Pugh(1), and is similar to those developed by Frank and Atkins(2). Our pilot survey was administered to a total of 209 students during the 2014-2015 academic year. Statistical analysis of the results give Cronbachs alpha of 0.96, with item-whole correlations all above 0.4. Exploratory factor analysis indicates two factors, with most item loadings >0.4 on one or the other factor.  Six of the 29 items had approximately equal loading on both factors.  We will present the results of Confirmatory Factor Analysis, as well as Rasch Analysis to test how well the survey matches our construct.

At Portland State University we have been developing courseware for introductory and intermediate level Physics for the Life Sciences classes that strengthen the connection students make between physics and medicine. As part of these courses, we have created a number of laboratory activities that explore the fundamental physics behind ubiquitous medical devices. Topics explored in the activities include planar x-ray imaging, Computed Tomography, Pulse Oximetry, electrocardiogram, and Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis. These activities feature original hardware and software, all of which are designed for easy adoption by other educational institutions. The materials have been assessed and refined over several iterations of an intermediate level biomedical physics course and some have been adapted for the introductory physics lab for life science students. Together they offer students an authentic, hands-on approach to exploring the relevance of physics to medicine.

In earlier work, we measured student evaluations of high school science teachers (biology, chemistry, and physics) and identified discipline-specific gender bias: women teachers tend to be underrated by male students (only) in biology and chemistry, but are underrated by both men and women in physics.  More recently, we showed that students' physics identities exacerbate this bias, with physics-identified students exhibiting greater gender bias than those with less affinity for physics, which is a worrying result for those interested to recruit more women to physics.  The data in the current study is drawn from the Sustainability and Gender in Engineering (SaGE) study, which collected students' prior high school science experiences, their evaluations of their teachers, as well as their career and major intentions.  In this work, we extend our analysis to consider how students' engineering career intentions confound (or not) their evaluations of their high school physics teachers.

In recent years, physics education research groups have designed new teaching and learning environments to give students opportunities to collaborate with their peers. To facilitate authentic group discussions in these classrooms, traditional problem-solving recitations are replaced with research-based course materials, such as Tutorials in Introductory Physics or Physics by Inquiry, to help students make sense of physics concepts and construct their own knowledge via multiple types of representations and group work. We explored how Tutorials in Physics Sense-making developed by the University of Maryland help students taking algebra-based introductory physics develop conceptual understanding through use of argumentation in small group discussions. We identified physics tutorials features through content analysis to understand how these features were helpful in the use of argumentation. This study was built on the analysis of those tutorials and examples of students answers for the subjects of Kinematics and Dynamics.

At Oregon State University, we implemented ISLE (Investigative Science Learning Environment) based labs in our introductory calculus-based physics course.  Previously, the laboratory experiments for this course were traditional: students followed step-by-step procedures to investigate phenomena.  Students were told the theory behind the experiment and what data to collect, with follow-up questions meant to aid their comprehension.  Each of the experiments was kept, but instead of students being given an extensive lab packet, they were given a single sheet with guidance about generic procedures for investigating the relevant ideas.  In effect, the labs were fully transformed with very little time investment and no need for new equipment.  These labs were a main component to the course transformations that lead to increased normalized gains on the FCI.  This paper will discuss in detail how easily transform existing labs to ISLE-based labs, and possible impacts on the student experience including student learning.

Transfer of learning is a very important objective of education.  However, students usually have difficulties in solving physics transfer tasks with different surface features. Here we investigated if instruction provided using videos which contain detailed explanations to the problems will improve students performance in tackling near and far tasks. We interviewed students enrolled in an algebra-based physics class. Each interview contains two sets of tasks. In each set students need to solve one initial task, four isomorphic training tasks or two isomorphic training tasks.  Students either watch one video, two videos, and/or receive visual cues depending on the condition to which they are assigned. Next they complete a near transfer task followed by a far transfer task. We compare students reasoning patterns and correctness in the three conditions.

Although equations and derivations are often presented in physics classes to emphasize conceptual logic, that logic may not be explicitly stated. We are studying the language used by physics instructors in classroom environments, paying close attention to their presentations of abstract mathematical relations (e.g. Gaussian surface integrals and Heaviside step functions). Videos analyzed include faculty lecturing in physical classrooms and from online courses publicly available. Discourse is categorized by an emergent coding scheme, based loosely on earlier work by Redish et al. that incorporates elements of the symbolic forms framework proposed by Sherin. This poster presents preliminary results obtained from both introductory and upper-level courses.

Physics faculty at three two-year colleges (TYCs) and a public, comprehensive four-year university (FYU) have been collaborating for over five years on projects focused on improving physics instruction and promoting science teaching careers.  The collaboration began with the implementation and refinement of novel instructional tools for use with diverse student populations and now includes a Learning Assistant program.  To improve the collaboration and illuminate successful elements of TYC/FYU partnerships, a qualitative case self-study was conducted using a lens of structure and agency.  Data analysis revealed tensions, which could serve as affordances or constraints, including whether the partners are individuals or institutions, if the partners are consumers or producers within the partnership, balancing flexibility and formality in instituting programs, and whether the focus of the partnership is specific products or the process of collaboration.  The study has implications for methods of initiation and continued development of TYC/FYU partnerships.

Most students will never take more than one course dedicated primarily to physics.  In addition, students, particularly female students, enter physics classes with depressed attitudes towards physics compared to the other sciences. Female students are more likely to opt out of a second higher-level physics course. Thus, the broad goal of this work is to better understand how to have the most lasting positive impact on female students attitudes and motivations towards learning physics after a single physics course in high school.  Through longitudinal case studies of six female students using frameworks of episodic memory and physics identity, we explore the most impactful features of students high school physics experiences.  The data is drawn from three years of student interviews, high school physics class observations, and physics teacher interviews.  Our results indicate that high arousal and positive valence experiences have the most lasting positive impact on female students' physics identity.

We evaluated the effectiveness of peer review in improving students' introductory laboratory report writing skills.  Two laboratory sections followed our standard scaffolded weekly report instructional approach, and two sections used peer review process on four of the reports, submitting only data and analysis on the others.  Peer review students submitted their report electronically, reviewed three peer reports, and then submitted their revised report to the instructor.  Initial and revised reports along with peer feedback were collected and analyzed.  The quality of reports from the two groups were similar throughout the semester although the peer review group wrote fewer reports. Students in both groups viewed the peer instructional approach as both a better instructional method and personally preferable.  Quality of feedback was an important concern of students about peer review, and the quality of feedback given to peers was a significant factor in students' own development as writers.

Summer academic bridge programs often play a dual role of supporting students academic and social integration in the transition from high school to college. Assessment of the impact of such programs tends to rely on self-reported student surveys and institutional records and often does not control for self-selection effects. Using multivariate-matching methods, this study examines the effect of a summer bridge engineering program on subsequent academic performance such as cumulative GPA. Controlling for selection effects, the analysis accounts for pre-college academic and demographic covariates and creates a matched control and treatment group. Within this well-controlled framework, we find no impact on selected academic outcomes, which resonates with other research findings. Viewed through the lens of Noras student engagement model, we discuss social integration outcomes which can potentially assess indirect programmatic effects such as participation in a Learning Assistant Program and enrollment in reformed STEM classes.

We evaluate the effectiveness of deliberate practice activities (DPA) using standard experiment/control protocol in the edX.org MOOC platform.  DPA (Erricson) focused on training a single skill at a time and providing detailed instant feedback.  We implemented them using both standard multiple choice format and a Drag and Drop format designed to reduce extraneous cognitive load by following multimedia design principles that stemmed from grounded cognition. We observed that for students who got the first question(s) wrong, the drag and drop format leads to significantly better learning on fundamental skills than multiple choice. Further analysis confirmed that the selected student population werent biased. We also compared DPA with practice on traditional problems, but did not find evidence that DPA leads to superior problem solving ability. We will discuss potential reasons for this observation.

Technology has become more central to the teaching and learning of physics. These technologies include calculators, computer resources (e.g. simulations, online social networks, homework systems), and response systems (e.g. clickers).  Drawing on data from a large scale national survey study with responses from 1955 students who had taken physics, we examined the effect of technology usage on students physics identity, physics grades, and STEM career interest.  Using Multivariate Matching, we compared groups who experienced or did not experience a particular technology and were matched on background.    We found that high technological saturation had a significant positive effect on physics identity. Computer simulations had a positive effect on both physics identity and STEM career interest.  Finally, science videos had a significant positive effect on physics grades but a negative effect on STEM career interest.  We will discuss these results as well as supplementary qualitative data on how teachers use these technologies.

In the process of completing a major, students transition their identity toward becoming a member of their professional fields. In Wenger's community of practice framework, community membership is built on alignment of common goals, participation in social interactions, and perceptions of belonging in the community. In this study of physics major identity development, we interviewed physics majors at a large, comprehensive state university as they began upper-division coursework. Transcripts reveal that many of these students experienced indecision about persisting in their degree even after having invested significant effort and time. Using the communities of practice lens, we will describe the contexts and interactions that motivated the students to seriously consider giving up membership in the physics community. Fortunately, the majority of the participants ultimately chose to persist and complete their degree. We will describe the experiences that participants perceived to be instrumental in their decisions.

An essential learning objective of any undergraduate practical lab class must be that students develop a sense of scientific process. As well as learning to use and apply specific experimental techniques, lab classes should provide an environment that encourages students to think and learn about the broader context and underlying methodologies.
This study set out to explore the impact of including problem-based cooperative learning (PBCL) in undergraduate physics labs. PBCL was shown to have a positive effect on student accessing higher cognitive levels of learning and on students engagement in their own learning during the physics lab. Overall, PBCL was shown to be an effective pedagogical instructional approach to enhancing undergraduate physics students engagement in their own learning in the lab and in enhancing their critical thinking skills.

Throughout introductory physics, students create and interpret free body diagrams in which multiple forces act on an object, typically at a single location (the objects center of mass).  The situation increases in difficulty when multiple objects are involved, and further when electric and magnetic fields are present. In the latter, sources of the fields are often identified as a set of electric charges or current-carrying wires, and students are asked to determine the electric or magnetic field at a separate location defined as the observation location. Previous research suggests students struggle with accounting for how a measurement or calculation depends on the observation location. We present preliminary results exploring the extent to which students struggle with observation location by analyzing student written work of problems involving vector addition of fields. This analysis is further supported by relevant episodes of classroom video from a studio-style, algebra-based, introductory electricity and magnetism course.

Prior research has shown that metacognitive skills are important for student success in higher education. However, little research has been done to explore student understanding of metacognition.  This poster focuses on classroom video collected at a two-week summer College Readiness Program at Rochester Institute of Technology. This summer experience is part of Project IMPRESS (Integrating Metacognitive Practices and Research to Ensure Student Success), which is designed to develop metacognitive skills in first generation and Deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) STEM undergraduates. We analyzed an episode from the first full day of the program where the students collaboratively developed a sign for the word metacognition for which there is not a sign in American Sign Language. We use this discussion to identify students initial thoughts and the groups final consensus of what metacognition means.

As part of a project to explore successful strategies for using studio methods, such as SCALE-UP, we explore strategic self-regulatory and motivational characteristics of students in said courses at three universities with varying student populations and differing success in studio-mode courses. We survey students using compiled questions from several existing questionnaires designed to measure student characteristics such as attitudes toward and motivations for learning physics, organization of scientific knowledge, experiences outside the classroom, and demographics. Other studies have identified five distinct learning profiles across varying student populations. Using a person-centered approach, we utilize cluster analysis methods to group students into learning profiles to better understand the study strategies and motives of algebra-based studio physics students. We present results from first-semester and second-semester studio-mode introductory physics courses across three universities. We identify these five distinct learning profiles and investigate demographics and concept inventory performance within and across them.

Recent study shows that providing a problem diagram can hurt students performance as it reduces the incentive for students to draw their own. We report 6 controlled AB experiments in a MOOC, comparing students performance and diagram drawing behavior in a total sample of 12 problem pairs. Removing the diagram makes a quarter of the problems slightly more difficult for low and medium skilled students, but often very significantly increases the likelihood of all students to draw their own diagram. We found that students of different skill levels made similar deliberate choices for each problem about whether to draw a diagram. Diagrams influence outcomes mostly in problems that involve ideal physics objects (e.g. blocks and pulleys) and those involving spatially and temporally complex real-life situations.  Apparently in most cases removing the problem diagram encourages diagram drawing without materially affecting students chances of answering it correctly.

In conjunction with the Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshops, we are investigating mechanisms to further support new faculty in improving their teaching. Previous work indicates that many faculty return from the workshop excited and attempt to integrate workshop ideas into their teaching. Unfortunately, many struggle and slowly revert back to traditional instruction. Further, participants have requested ongoing support for their teaching efforts. We are investigating ways to provide such support by offering a Faculty Online Learning Community (FOLC) with a subset of workshop participants. The FOLC has a goal of supporting self-reflective teachers in a way that is sustainable. We have used several communities as models, including the Math/Twitter Blog-o-sphere and the Global Physics Department. We have also done research on the best uses of technology for communication. This talk will focus on results from our initial FOLC experience and plans for future FOLC offerings.

We have studied a group of middle school teachers as they modified curriculum and developed common formative assessments on force and motion concepts. While discussing assessment goals for student understanding of acceleration, two of the teachers held opposing models about the implications of the sign of acceleration on the direction of an objects motion and whether it is speeding up or slowing down. Failing to resolve the inconsistency between their individual models, the resultant assessment item was such that both models would provide the same correct response, albeit for different reasons. The potential for correct answers for incorrect reasons perpetuated ambiguity into its classroom use as a formative measure of student understanding. More specifically, the item had limited ability both to accurately inform teacher instruction, interventions, and feedback that would support students in identifying their mistakes and refining their thinking.

In order to better understand the impact of lab courses and experiential learning on students views of professional physics and physics careers, we are developing tools that assess students epistemology specifically related to physics experiments.    We have conducted a series of open-ended individual interviews about doing physics experiments with students in various stages of academic study, from introductory level physics courses to graduate research labs.  The interviews were used to develop a more detailed framework of students epistemology of experimental physics, which includes topics such as justifications for the validity of experiments, relationship between theory and experiment, autonomy in experimentation, and the role of uncertainty analysis. Based on the preliminary findings, we developed and administered an open-ended survey to a larger student population in order to more clearly identify key aspects of epistemological development from introductory physics students to graduate students.

Successful pedagogical change in an institution often has a non-linear trajectory. This poster looks at one specific pedagogical change, SCALE-UP. Using case studies of secondary adoption of SCALE-UP, we note commonalities and differences in the pre-existing conditions of successful SCALE-UP implementations.

Graduate-level Quantum Mechanics can be a significant barrier to obtaining a Ph. D. in Physics. The difficulty of the material is compounded by the relative scarcity of education-research based conceptual questions, short, tractable examples, and practice problems at that level. It is harder still for those who encounter difficulties developing a cohort of friends with whom to work, a problem that disproportionally affects members of under-represented minorities. To alleviate some of these problems, we have developed materials and piloted a series of guided group work sessions for Graduate Quantum Mechanics students. We describe the nature and logistics of the guided group work, .  and we report on data from surveys, weekly pre-post quizzes, and grades in course material. Overall, the reception from students and faculty has been positive, but because of potential self-selection effects, it is difficult to make conclusions on improvements in course performance. Future work is also discussed.

This study investigates a group of 36 high school students in a physics classroom playing a computer game that simulates the electric field as a hockey field, the Electric Field Hockey. Students engage in the activity, experimenting with the electrostatic phenomena simulated in the game, prior to receiving formal instruction. We argue that students engaging in a game that is designed to explore the electric field can gain experiences with simulated electrostatic phenomena and draw upon increasingly sophisticated understandings of the electric field. These experiences could eventually be useful for their later learning of electrostatics. We analyzed classroom videos and in this paper present a case study about the group mentioned above. The results show that students drew upon their understandings of the electric field, progressed through the increasingly difficult levels of the game, overcame the tensions in the activity, and gained experiences with the simulated electrostatic phenomena.

One aspect of a students construction of knowledge instructors should be aware of is student self-regulation: an internal process by which students create an effective environment for learning. Instructor feedback, can be a powerful tool used to affect student self-regulation. Furthermore, constructivist-learning theory suggests that strong self-regulators are more efficient learners. Thus, instructors may be able to positively influence students construction of knowledge by providing grader assessment feedback (GAF) that affects student self-regulation. I compared three different types of GAF used in introductory physics courses and investigated how students use of each GAF impacts student self-regulation. I present preliminary results from a quasi-experimental study indicating whether or not students use GAF and how their use of GAF affects student self-regulation. I will also present results suggesting if students respond differently to different GAF styles. This research will be conducted with undergraduate college students in calculus-based and algebra-based introductory-level physics courses.

One vision for the classroom use of learning progressions (LPs) involves using diagnostic assessments to determine a students LP level in order to make instructional decisions. However, little is known about how experienced teachers reason about assessment information and how LP-based information would support their instructional decision-making.  In this paper, we explore five experienced teachers interactions with the same set of LP-based score reports to address the following questions: (1) What assumptions do teachers make about student thinking as they interact with LP-based assessment information? (2) What instructional reasoning is supported by these assumptions? We find that teachers conceptualize and use the LP levels differently from how the LP designers intended, but that the LP-based diagnostic information can be helpful to them in other, sometimes unanticipated, ways.

In this project, we seek to understand how instructors scaffold and support students interdisciplinary engagement in an Introductory Physics for the Life Sciences course (IPLS) developed at the University of Maryland, College Park.  The development of this course was embedded in a broader design research project.  Here we analyze how one educator positioned the scientific disciplines in relation to one another over a two year time span.  During this time, the design research team gave formative feedback to the instructor regarding how students were interpreting these comments about the disciplines and their relationships.  Our analysis of the educators classroom discourse demonstrates shifts in the messages the instructors sends about the domains of physics and biology.  In year one, physics and biology were largely described as distinct and different, but in year 2 they were more frequently described as complementary and overlapping.

We investigated the effect of hint modality on students eye movements on conceptual physics problems with diagrams. We recruited 144 students enrolled in a physics class for future elementary teachers. The participants were randomly assigned to conditions with no hints, visual hints, text hints, audio hints, and all the possible hint modality combinations. We found that different hint modalities affect participants eye movements differently and the difference of participants eye movements relates to their problem-solving performance. Based on our results, we propose a new conceptual model for problem solving with multimedia hints to interpret eye movements and performance data.

Previous studies have investigated the role of correct and incorrect patterns of reasoning in problem solving in physics, which show that the students responses are influenced by their prior knowledge and past experience. In this study we investigate how manipulating display design may affect students attention to the relevant information on the diagram via a bottom-up process. We have manipulated the perceptual saliency of the visual features of the problem diagram based on the Gestalt principle of grouping. The manipulation aims to facilitate the selection and integration of the relevant information from the problem diagram. We have used the similarity principle to enhance the relevant areas on the diagrams by grouping similar visual elements using shape, color, size and orientation. We interviewed students in an algebra-based physics class. We discuss the effect of bottom-up processes on students reasoning in both Gestalt and non-Gestalt versions of the problems.

Continuing our efforts to understand affective responses to studio-style courses, we surveyed students (total N = 144) enrolled in four sections of an algebra-based physics course at Eastern Kentucky University. The 14 activities in the modified Pedagogical Expectancy Violation Assessment (PEVA) clustered into three factors based on students reported frequency of experience: personal effort, classmate interactions, and instructor support. Each factor was related to satisfaction in the course, but in different ways. Students who experienced instructor-related activities such as feedback and problem-solving demonstrations more frequently were more satisfied. Students who did not enjoy putting forth personal effort or interacting with classmates were less satisfied. Similarly, students who did not rate personal effort or classmate interaction activities as essential to the course were less satisfied. We present these results as a case study for identifying possible sources of pushback in interactive physics courses.

Current step-by-step, problem-solving frameworks have been shown to improve problem-solving success.  However, solutions that break from these frameworks may embody a commonly unmeasured aspect of physics problem-solving expertise: use of conceptual shortcuts to minimize mathematical computations.  Adopting an approach from Heckler (2009), we show that prompting introductory physics students to draw free-body diagrams before solving force problems decreases the use of conceptual shortcuts and increases reproduction of standard procedures.  Extending this paradigm, students were then asked to evaluate an informal solution for a force problem.  When the problem text included a diagram prompt, students rated the informal solution less favorably, commenting that the solution was not formal enough.  These results imply that the prompt to draw a diagram not only cues procedural problem-solving approaches, but also pushes students away from informal approaches that could demonstrate problem-solving expertise.

We have been running Project lab course for freshman and sophomore physics majors for more than 12 years. The main goal of the course is to develop students' science competences and skills in situations that are close to working conditions of physicists. Students work in small groups on open ended practical problems. Last year we transformed the course by adopting scientific abilities self-assessment rubrics (1) as a tool to help students improve specific steps in experimental design. The poster will describe the design of the research project that we conducted to analyze the effects of this transformation and its findings. Research was carried out by pre-service physics teachers as a part of their professional preparation.

Studies show that having students attempt to generate a scientific principle before receiving formal instruction can benefit their learning. However, the design affordances of these generation activities have not been fully addressed. In this paper, we compare the effect of two different generation activities on student learning of a buoyancy principle. In one condition students are provided with representative cases of a phenomenon to generate the principle. In the other condition, to generate the rule, students can more freely explore the phenomenon using an interactive simulation.  83 community college students participated in the study. Students in the representative cases condition generated more complete rules and performed significantly better in solving buoyancy problems. We hypothesize that this variation between conditions results from different levels of exposure to important cases. This study suggests that proper scaffolding to assure sufficient exposure is essential in designing a generation activity.

A variety of tools have been created to understand student performance on multiple-choice tests, including analysis of normalized gain, item response curves, and more. These methods typically focus on correct answers. Many incorrect student responses contain value and can be used as building blocks for instruction, but present tools do not account for productive reasoning leading to an incorrect response. Inspired by Item Response Curves, we introduce Idea Use Curves, which relate frequency with which an idea is used to student ability. We use this tool to consider ideas which may be present in both correct responses and distractors, letting us focus on students conceptual understanding. This tool is made with the goal of identifying ideas that are consistently used by students who perform well or poorly, allowing researchers and instructors to look beyond the correct/incorrect paradigm. We explore student reasoning about energy as a proof of concept for this method.

When physics students engage in collaborative exercises, they must negotiate their different problem-solving strategies in order to work together effectively.   One lens through which to understand these interactions is the construct of epistemic games. These constructs have been used to describe particular methods of problem solving with which students are observed to engage.  In prior work, an answer-making epistemic game has been observed, wherein the student views the primary objective of the activity as producing an answer, and reasons until they arrive at an answer or intuits an answer and then tries to justify this answer. This game was observed in the context of individual students working independently on multiple-choice questions. We present preliminary analysis of the appearance of a shared answer-making epistemic game when a group of students worked collaboratively on conceptual problems.

Research indicates that cooperative learning leads to an increase in both student achievement and motivation. This study investigates the characteristics of collaborative group learning and teachers assumptions of effective group work.  Video data of groups engaging in the Physics and Everyday Thinking High School (PET-HS) activities was collected from one teacher piloting the curriculum, and salient characteristics of group interactions were identified. These characteristics were organized into codes. The frequency of these codes was analyzed for three videos of different groups and compared to one another. Based upon the code frequency analysis, the group that teachers identified as most effective, engaged most in sense making and questioning. Additionally, this group spent the most time talking and had equity of voice. These findings may have implications for assessing group dynamics, the level at which groups are functioning, efficacy, and student achievement.

Students rarely develop school-prompted interests in science in ways that lead to out-of-school engagement. Existing research has highlighted that positive science identities foster this out-of-school engagement. We have been investigating a form of out-of-school engagement called transformative experiencesa construct that characterizes moments where students engage in free-choice transfer of science concepts to everyday settings in ways they find meaningful. Based on interviews conducted with undergraduate students who had indicated deep out-of-school engagement based on a transformative experience survey, we compare and contrast three cases that illustrate a broader spectrum of factors that may contribute to students engagement outside of class. While our analysis corroborates previous findings concerning the role that science identity can play, our analysis sheds new light on ways in which topical interest and classroom dynamics can also foster transformative experiences.

Every year, graduate admissions processes determine which applicants are admitted to doctoral programs in physics around the country, and which are not.  Despite their importance, relatively little is known about how admissions decisions are made and the normative practices surrounding them. In the current work, we adapt topological data methods (general techniques for cluster identification and relation) to look for the existence of distinct admissions strategies that institutions use in their admissions decisions.  We analyze data drawn from a recent survey of faculty (graduate directors, etc) responsible for doctoral admissions, conducted in conjunction with the APS Bridge Program, which includes responses from individuals at over 75% of the doctoral-granting departments in the U.S.

Previous research has investigated how expansive framing of the learning context can promote transfer (Engel, et. al 2012). A physics course for future elementary teachers was redesigned to infuse PCK into the learning experiences of the students by fusing the process of learning physics concepts with kids ideas about those concepts. The course frames students learning around their future career as elementary teachers.  Expansive framing is integrated into the learning cycle to promote transfer of learning.  Students created micro-lessons for elementary students on the topics learned in class. We analyzed students micro-lessons to determine if there is evidence of transfer of science content and pedagogical strategies. We evaluated the physics concepts and PCK demonstrated in the micro-lessons. We also assessed the level of integration with their social context by examining the extent to which the students expansively framed their micro-lessons.

Does the type of homework assigned in an introductory physics course affect exam performance? In Spring 2014, two sections of algebra-based second-semester introductory physics were taught by the same instructor. Class-time for both sections focused primarily on building conceptual understanding, with minor emphasis on the mechanics of problem solving.  End-of-chapter problems were assigned to each of the two sections:  Section A was assigned 8-10 conceptual exercises; Section B was assigned 2-3 computational problems.  The alternate problem sets were recommended to students, but were not collected for grading. Three exams and a comprehensive final exam were given, each evenly weighted with conceptual and computational problems.  We anticipated that (1) students in the section requiring conceptual homework would perform better on conceptual exam questions than students required to submit computational homework and (2) students in both sections would perform equally well on the computational exam problems.   This poster will present our findings.

Research has shown that visual cues can facilitate problem solving by helping direct students attention to relevant areas of a diagram. In this study, we investigate the effect of visual cues and outcome feedback on students visual attention while solving conceptual physics problems containing a diagram. Students enrolled in introductory mechanics courses were individually interviewed using a think-aloud protocol. In the main study, students solved four sets of problems, each set containing an initial problem, four training problems, a near transfer problem, and a far transfer problem. Students in the cued condition saw visual cues on the training problems, and students in the feedback condition were told whether their responses were correct or incorrect.  In the delayed transfer study conducted two weeks later, the same students solved the near and far transfer problems from the main study. Students visual attention on the transfer and delayed transfer problems will be discussed.

The Physics and Astronomy Department at Michigan State University recently began to redesign its introductory physics courses.  At the center of this transformation effort is an attempt to include scientific practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas in the assessments and instruction of the courses.  As part of a research effort, we have been developing the Three-Dimensional Learning Assessment Protocol (3D-LAP) to characterize how assessments used in introductory courses change over time.  This instrument provides criteria by which scientific practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas can be identified within assessment items.  Additionally, this instrument can be used to help write new assessment items or improve existing ones.  This poster will focus on the 3D-LAP and using it to track changes in assessments over time as well as to build assessment items that incorporate all three dimensions.

We have been conducting a long-term investigation at the University of Washington into student difficulties with electrostatics concepts at multiple levels.  One of the results from this study suggests that standard lecture instruction does not provide students with a coherent conceptual model to understand conductors in electrostatics.  To address these difficulties, we developed new tutorial worksheets for both Tutorials in Introductory Physics and Tutorials in Physics on the electric properties of conductors.  This paper demonstrates that a teaching strategy designed to help students build a mechanistic model of charges in conductors significantly improves student understanding of conductors, at both the introductory and junior level.

A robust grasp of plane waves is helpful for studying advanced Optics topics such as reflection, interference, and the wavelength dependence of refractive index.  Although there have been many studies of students understanding of waves, only a small fraction have been dedicated to plane waves, which are particularly challenging both conceptually and mathematically.  In this study, 30-45 minute interviews about plane waves were conducted with nine upper-level science/engineering majors, all of whom had previously taken courses in electromagnetic theory where plane waves were invoked.  The interviews revealed several aspects of how students struggle to move between conceptual and mathematical representations of plane waves.  Examples include a disconnect between 1-D and 3-D waves (relating to 1-D physically but 3-D only mathematically),  an inability to articulate how the mathematical form dictates planar iso-surfaces, and the challenge of interpreting multiple types of vectors (e.g. E-fields and wavevectors) drawn in the same diagram.

The pedagogical framework, Structured Quantitative Inquiry Lab (SQILab) provides an environment where students can effectively develop and hone their critical thinking and scientific reasoning skills. In a previous study, students in a SQILab course were compared to students in the same course but without the SQILab framework. Both groups of students conducted an identical physics experiment to determine the index of refraction of a piece of Plexiglass. Students in the SQILab course demonstrated more critical thought on their measurements and data than the control group, but were still unlikely to resolve systematic effects or use comparisons to motivate improving their data. In this study, we implemented several recommendations from the previous work with a new cohort of students and evaluated their performance on the same experiment to answer the questions posed by the previous study. The results from this new evaluation is very indicative of the efficacy of the SQILab.

One-minute papers, also known as exit tickets, are a formative assessment strategy that asks students to respond to one or two short-answer prompts following an in-class lesson.  Typically, the prompts ask students to identify a key take-home lesson and a question or confusion they have about the lesson.  Students' responses help instructors gauge students' understanding and engagement in the class.  We  investigate how coding such regular, brief post-class reflections for sophistication of reasoning can provide a useful proxy measure of aggregate student engagement and growth in critical thinking in a general-education physics class.  In future work, we plan to investigate using automated methods to statistically code aggregate levels of scientific reasoning in large-enrollment classes.

Quantum mechanics is challenging even for advanced undergraduate and graduate students.

We investigate the extent to which students can qualitatively determine the affect of a perturbation to the energy of well-known eigenfunctions. After lecture instruction we find that many students cannot determine some important features of the first-order correction to the energy when provided with the appropriate equation. We examine the possibility that this failure may stem from a lack of understanding of the inner product, in particular, how to determine the inner product of functions represented graphically. We have found that some students are unable to find the inner product of graphical functions in contexts outside of quantum mechanics.  However, the results are even worse for similar questions in the context perturbation theory or other quantum mechanical questions requiring the use of inner products.

Quantum entanglement is a central concept of quantum theory for multiple particles. Entanglement played an important role in the development of the foundations of the theory, and makes possible modern applications in quantum information technology including teleportation, quantum computing and cryptography. 
We have investigated student understanding of two-particle quantum entanglement at the introductory and advanced undergraduate levels. We collected student activity responses using two versions of an interactive QuVis simulation "Entanglement: The nature of quantum correlations" (www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics/quvis/simulations_html5/sims/entanglement/entanglement.html) and carried out a small number of student interviews. 
Common incorrect ideas found in this work include stating that all entangled states must be maximally entangled (i.e. show perfect correlations or anticorrelations), that the spins of particles in a product state have definite values (are not in a superposition state with respect to spin) and difficulty factorizing product states. Outcomes from this work will inform further development of the QuVis Entanglement simulation.

These studies involved students both from the first-semester calculus-based mechanics course for physical science and engineering majors as well as from the first-semester algebra-based mechanics course which primarily serves life science majors.  Volunteering students were randomly divided into two groups.  Each group worked through a series of standard homework questions in either the traditional format or in the mastery-style format.  Both groups then took a short post-test on the material covered.  We compare the performance of the students in the two different groups, as well as in the two different courses.

Transfer of learning from one context to another is considered a hallmark of expertise. Physics education research has often found that students have great difficulty transferring knowledge from one context to another. We examine upper-level and graduate students facility with questions about the interference pattern in the double-slit experiment with single photons and polarizers in various orientations placed in front of one or both slits. Answering these questions correctly in the context of the double-slit experiment requires transfer of knowledge of concepts students had learned in the context of a tutorial on Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) with single photons and polarizers in various paths of MZI. We discuss the extent to which students who worked through the MZI tutorial were able to transfer their knowledge gained in that context to another context involving the double-slit experiment.

The ability to judge the difficulty of physics problems has implications for both exam preparation and performance.  Previous research has shown that students spend more time studying problems they judge as more difficult, but this strategy is effective only when these judgments match the normative difficulty of the questions. Little is known about how accurate instructors and students are at judging problem difficulty.  We present data from two experiments where physics experts and introductory physics students predict which question of a pair taken from real exams is more difficult for the typical student.  In the first experiment we analyze whether the rationales given by physics experts are predictive of accurate judgments.  In the second experiment we compare the accuracy of experts and novices in their judgments. We discuss the educational implications of our findings.

In K-12 educational settings, conservation of energy is typically presented in two ways: the conservation of energy principle (energy is neither created nor destroyed) and the sociopolitical need to conserve energy (we guard against energy being used up). These two meanings of conservation typically remain disconnected from each other and can appear contradictory, even after instruction. In an effort to support teachers in building robust understandings of energy from their existing knowledge, I designed a study to investigate the productive ideas in K-12 teachers conversations about energy. A micro-analysis of discourse, gestures, and artifacts of professional development courses revealed teachers productive ideas about three aspects of energy: conceptual metaphor, dissipation and degradation. Energy conservation can be better taught and learned in K-12 Education by connecting teachers' productive ideas to canonical physics.

We use students Brief, Embedded, Spontaneous Metacognitive (BESM) Talk to examine the students characterization of science, along with the ways students uniquely contributed to their group. This analysis aims to improve the understanding of the relation between students expectations of experimentation and the way they think and reflect about scientific processes.

Research has shown that treating laboratory activities as an integral part of lessons increases student learning. Laboratory work in schools, however, is often done as standalone activities. In this poster we present a Lesson Study inspired Professional Development program for in-service high and middle school science teachers that facilitates teacher collaboration on lab-integrated lessons.  During two weeks in the summer, teachers use the IOLab multi-sensor device to develop two-three lessons for which the lab-activities play a central role. During the following school year, we videotape the classroom implementations of the lessons and meet with teachers in study group sessions to discuss the implementations. At the study group sessions, teachers watch video clips of their respective instruction. The following summer, teachers revise implemented lessons and develop new lessons.  
In the poster, we report on the professional development programs impact on teacher instruction and student outcome.

In recent years, there has been a considerable increasing in physics education research (PER) about students learning/understanding in Quantum mechanics courses. The researches mainly focus on revealing students challenges on mastering specific topic of quantum physics such as atom model (Quantum model & Electron cloud model), Hydrogen atom, Wave-particle duality the nature of eigenfunction, potential wells, and uncertainty principle. New approach studies, on the other hand, offer some instructional tools and strategies, which are suggested to be useful to minimize learning difficulties and enhance meaningful conceptual understanding in oppose to conventional way of teaching quantum mechanics. This study aimed to present common upper high school and college students difficulties that have been revealed by current literature, as well as different teaching approaches to deal with these learning difficulties.  We believe that a well-organized literature synthesize will help instructional designers and researchers in PER to scaffold their future works.

Students preparing for Physics exams must make decisions on what material to study, how to best prepare, and estimate their preparedness. Previous research has demonstrated that low performing students tend to over predict their learning and preparedness. Providing students with absolute and normative feedback has been shown to reduce over-prediction. We present data from an experiment where low performing students in an introductory mechanics course completed a computer-adaptive practice exam, completed a pretest followed by an intervention involving one of two styles of video solutions, and then completed a post-test before taking a midterm exam. We present data that suggest that students are able to learn from viewing video solutions to previously solved problems. We discuss the educational implications of our findings.

Helping students learn to think like a physicist is an important goal of many physics courses. One characteristic of physics experts is that they have learned how to learn and they use problem solving as an opportunity for learning. In particular, physics experts automatically reflect upon their mistakes in their problem solution in order to repair, extend and organize their knowledge structure.  Unfortunately, for many students, even in an upper-level physics course, problem solving is a missed learning opportunity. We investigated how well students in upper-level quantum mechanics learn from their mistakes and perform in the final exam when provided with explicit incentives to correct their mistakes in the midterm exams compared to those who were not given explicit incentives to correct their mistakes. Findings will be discussed.

Students enrolled in General Physics II at The University of Findlay major in a wide variety of programs such as biology, physical therapy, forensic science, nuclear medicine, and pre-veterinary science. For over five years, our General Physics II course has featured a semester-long research project, in which each student comes up with his/her own research idea. The project must involve at least one physics concept and include creative as well as experimental components. While conducting the research, students design a scientific experiment, analyze their data by making use of physics knowledge and Excel or other tools, draw solid conclusions based on their data and observations, and present their projects in a scientific poster format. In our presentation, the timeline of implementing the research assignment, examples of students projects, rubrics for grading, assessment of learning outcomes, and opportunities as well as challenges in implementing research in the course are addressed.

Content knowledge for teaching (CKT) is a practice - based theory of the professional knowledge that a person needs to be able to carry out tasks of teaching in the classroom (Ball, Thames and Phelps, 2008). One such task of teaching is developing instructional materials and assessments that meet the goals of instruction. In this poster, we will discuss the development process of the protocol. We will then provide data from the artifacts collected from 33 teachers across the United States. We will use this data and examples from the artifacts to illustrate the differences in both the content of the artifacts and the types of tasks students are asked to complete. Finally,we will compare the initial results from the coding of artifacts to other measures of Content Knowledge for Teaching of Energy.

Our recent study showed that two lab courses, whose goals were exclusively to reinforce material developed in the lecture courses, do not provide any added value to learning the concepts than the other components of the course. In this study, we will replicate this analysis with a modified version of one of these courses whose goals also included modeling, designing experiments, and analyzing and visualizing data. This modified course used the same set of experiments as the previous version, but changed the pre-lab and in-lab activities to focus on developing and testing models. The study is evaluating whether these additional goals and activities will help or hinder students learning of the physics material compared to previous results.

This study investigates the effects of various uses of Learning Assistants(LAs) on student outcomes across 13 LA Alliance member institutions. Over 4,500 students and 19 instructors participated in the study. The Force and Motion Concept Evaluation (FMCE) and the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment (BEMA) and others were used in 32 different classes across the U.S. Our analysis links course-level information (e.g. how LAs are utilized) and average LA-student interaction time to course learning gains. We will report results from various institutional settings and discuss contextual effects on student outcomes within the disciplines of physics, biology, chemistry, and calculus.

We present the preliminary results of a study on student use of representations in problem solving within the Modeling Instruction  Electricity and Magnetism (MI-E&M) course.  Representational competence is a critical skill needed for students to develop a sophisticated understanding of college science topics and to succeed in their science courses.  In this study, 70 students from the MI-E&M, calculus-based course were given a survey of 25 physics problem statements both pre- and post- instruction, covering both Newtonian Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism (E&M).  For each problem statement, students were asked which representations they would use in that given situation.  We analyze the survey results through network analysis, identifying which representations are linked together in which contexts.   We also compare the representation networks for those students who had already taken the first-semester Modeling Instruction Mechanics course and those students who had taken a non-Modeling Mechanics course.

Through the use of the Real-time Instructor Observing Tool (RIOT) we examine the differences in actions of multiple TAs in mini-studios, which combine student centered recitations with inquiry-based labs. TA actions observed include open or closed dialogue, passive or active observing, and clarifying or explaining to students. We observed five TAs teaching seven algebra-based first-semester physics labs to approximately 30 students per section. Individual TAs created an action profile that consists of the proportion of time spent on each action for that specific TA. These action profiles were found by averaging the duration of TA actions across multiple labs for a single TA. Surprisingly, with this method we found that TAs with a Learning Assistant tended to explain less and interact with the students less. We also found that there is a lack of consistency between the TAs in the overall time spent on each action.

It is often the case that many students who are taking college introductory physics courses have difficulties in understanding basic concepts in physics. This trend in the U.S similarly happens in Japan. In this study factors that have strong correlations with FCI pre and post test scores were identified for Japanese students in an introductory physics course (N=22). We found that gender and mathematics grades had a stronger correlation with FCI scores than the level of high-school physics and results of scientific reasoning survey. In order to further investigate the situation, we conducted semi-structured interviews with four students who were having serious problems in understanding concepts in mechanics. Our analysis revealed common features among the students when they tried to explain the motion of an object on slope. We argue that interactive teaching strategies would be an effective way to help such students understand basics physics concepts.

As part of a larger study investigating the equivalency  of out-of-class use of online concept inventories to in-class use of pencil/ paper version of the same concept inventory, we began studying how easy it is for students to cheat on an online concept inventory.  As part of this study, we invited two groups of students to take an online version of the FCI.  With the first group of students, we  encouraged students to look up the answers online in an unproctored environment.  The second group of students completed the online version of the FCI in a proctored environment.  For both groups,  we collected data on how long it took students to answer each question, as well as keeping track of any different websites they visited to obtain the answers. We were able to determine this by using monitoring software to monitor students activities while taking the online concept inventories.

In our preparatory kinematics and dynamics course of about 500 students, we replaced traditional immediate feedback homework with mastery-style homework. This mastery mode required students to perfect a set of questions before moving on to the next level of increased difficulty, and implemented narrated animated solutions to provide instructional support, if necessary. 

Student behavior within the system and students' resulting performance illuminated both strengths and obstacles of implementation for this type of homework in a large class of struggling students.  Data from the semester-long study will be shown, as well as explained in context as a tool to improve the material and delivery for our next semester of students.

We describe the initial phase of a project to implement PER-based instructional techniques to study and improve an upper-level introductory condensed matter course. First, we worked closely with the instructor to design and implement online pre-lecture questions and studied student responses to these questions. The questions were conceptual and/or diagrammatic in nature. A final question prompted students to ask questions or describe areas of confusion, which were address in the following lecture. Second, we conducted exploratory interviews to identify student difficulties with the course material. Finally, we compiled course materials, including pre-lecture questions, homework, exams, and lecture notes, as a resource for other instructors. Feedback from the instructors and students about the pre-lecture questions was positive. Here we present preliminary results obtained from student responses to the pre-lecture questions and interviews which highlight student difficulties in interpreting band diagrams, determining crystal structures, and utilizing concepts related to the Fermi energy.

Paired (or co-)teaching, in which two faculty are collaboratively responsible for all aspects of teaching a course, has been suggested as a method for the dissemination of evidence-based teaching strategies [1]. We report on five paired teaching arrangements, all involving a new or non-PER (Physics Education Research) faculty (the novice) being paired with a faculty member experienced in PER-based methods (the expert). Using a variety of data, including structured classroom observations and post-semester interviews with the instructors, we address two questions: 1. What factors make for effective paired teaching arrangements? 2. How do these factors affect faculty development as instructors (learning about teaching) in these arrangements? We find that faculty learn in a variety of areas, including content knowledge about teaching and learning, skills knowledge (teaching practices), and attitudes towards teaching and learning, and we identify factors that influence this development.

The PISEC afterschool program at CU Boulder relies on university educators (UEs) from the Physics Department to teach K-12 children from underrepresented populations. These UEs (undergrads and grads) hold valuable information about what it takes for an individual to pursue a path in physics. In order to learn how individuals make sense of their physics identities, six UEs were interviewed about their own pathways into the field. To analyze these interviews, we utilize a narrative inquiry process combined with Nasirs (2011) framework of racialized identity resources. These interviews are analyzed in a two-step process: 1) to understand how participants make sense of their journey into physics, and 2) to investigate how their stories connect to race and gender. We find that the way UEs talk about their pathways pulls on common discourses around race and gender in STEM and gives information about what resources were most influential along their way.

Reviewing the work of their peers can help students enhance their own learning.  It can also help them develop metacognitive skills such as the ability to appreciate what constitutes high quality work and to critically evaluate their own work; skills which are crucial if they are to improve.

Adaptive comparative judgement (ACJ) is a process in which multiple pairwise comparisons are used to rank assessment items.  We used ACJ as part of an in-course assessment in an early-years physics course.  Students were presented with pairs of solutions authored by their peers and asked to make a comparative judgment as to which of each pair was the better, based on the dimension of quality which piece of work most clearly and effectively satisfies the task set out in the question?. Student ranking using ACJ was compared to standard marking by staff/TAs.

Our Teacher Research Team investigated student outcomes in eight different high school physics courses at three different points in the learning cycle: before instruction, after experimentation, and after the consensus discussion. The discussion is designed to help students induce scientific principles from laboratory experiments, so we predicted the gain would be highest following this discussion. We observed different results for each question on the diagnostic assessment. In one case, the majority of the gain was made after experimentation, whereas, for another question the gain occurred primarily after the discussion. We inferred that some laboratory observations (e.g. force in direction of motion) link to disciplinary principles in a more straightforward way, whereas other observations (e.g. constant velocity on a frictionless track) require more time for students to process ideas through discussion and written formalizations. We will show our results and discuss implications of this work for assessment and instruction.

We aim to understand the development of student practices relating to the construction and evaluation of scientific communication. To this end, we included in our reformed introductory physics course a set of laboratory activities in which each student produced a five-minute video lab report and submitted it for peer review. In Spring 2014, 361 Georgia Tech students participated in this course and produced four lab report videos each. With this poster, we follow up on our previous work which established a semster-long improvement in peer grading accuracy with an analysis of the physics content of these lab report videos, the relationship between physics content and peer grade, and the language used by video authors when presenting physics content.

In our introductory physics laboratories at UNC-Chapel Hill, we have been administering a lab practicum since 2001.

Trends in student performance and lessons learned will be shared in this poster.  Sample lab exam questions and answers with explanations are provided for students to help them prepare for their exam; these can be found on our department website: www.physics.unc.edu/labs

Modeling how students think about physics is often measured via observation of students solving physics problems [1]. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may inform how these processes occur, but currently no neuroimaging studies have examined how students develop physics problem-solving skills. To provide insight into the neural nature of physics learning we conducted a meta-analysis identifying the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) as the region most consistently implicated across problem-solving tasks. We then examined resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in brain regions supporting problem-solving. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired pre/post instruction in 7 undergraduate, first-time enrollees in introductory physics. Correspondence between post-instruction rsFC and meta-analytic results suggests a semester of university physics may facilitate enhanced recruitment of posterior brain regions involved in reasoning. Increased IFG-correlated activity from pre to post instruction indicates intrinsic brain connectivity may be modulated as a result of educational experience.

For the past two years, introductory physics students at Roger Williams University have teamed up with students from our school of education to help the fourth graders at Nathanial Greene Elementary School in Pawtucket, RI, put on their annual Science Night for students and families.  The goals of the program were to get our physics students (from mostly science and engineering majors) to think creatively about how to demonstrate basic physics concepts, how to teach these concepts to education majors and elementary school students, to expose our student population to a diverse and often challenging environment, and to hopefully get the physics students to think about future careers in education.  Our students mostly find the experience to be fun, non-threatening, and report it invigorated their love of science.  We report on the results from student surveys and reflections.

Physics as an undergraduate course of study has been on the rise across the country, yet this trend may not extend to all demographics.  To study this phenomenon, we examined the Physics BS program at Purdue University over the matriculating classes between 1990 and 2010.  Purdue University offers several physics degrees: BS in Physics (Honors and regular), BS in Applied Physics (Honors and Regular), and BS in Physics Education.  Over this 20 year period, the number of physics majors has greatly increased. However, this does not seem to be the case for female and other underrepresented minorities.  By studying the progression of the matriculating and graduating Physics classes, we hope to determine potential trends in transferring or post-graduation paths across the different demographics and physics majors.

Quality assessment is important in physics education. However, it can be challenging to construct assessments measuring students understanding of concepts and elicit deeper levels of cognition during problem solving.  Tests are common assessments, but students assume test questions will have a numeric or symbolic answer. This study analyzes test responses and reflections on a question without a numeric or symbolic answer from a calculus-based physics class.  Though designed to test conceptual understanding, it was largely unsuccessful due to students assumptions that a numeric answer was needed. We analyzed students responses and short reflections on the problem by looking at ways students tried to solve the problem and their uncertainties when confronted by a non-traditional test question. Using a framework of epistemological framing, we found that students used a variety of framings to pursue a solution; though common patterns emerge that can inform instructors and physics education researchers.

The Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC) seeks to better understand physics teacher education efforts taking place at institutions that have physics teacher education as a priority, in order to better engage and support those institutions in producing more well-prepared physics teachers. PhysTEC also seeks to understand faculty leaders theories as to why there are so few future physics teachers a their institution, in order to positively influence faculty perceptions and foster leadership in physics teacher education. Results of an interview study indicate that institutions exhibit four broad patterns of institutional engagement with physics teacher education (inactive, track, active, and priority). Faculty leaders theories about the scarcity of future physics teachers refer to both cultural and institutional barriers to physics teacher production.

Student reasoning remains an important research topic in physics education.  To study reasoning in a simple context we pilot tested short, dichotomous classification questions.   These questions present students with a physical situation and ask for classification as possible or impossible, followed by a logical justification and several Likert scale self-assessments.   The questions require reasoning, but can be figured out with one key idea, and one or two logical steps. We developed 16 questions and tested them in clinical interviews with 22 undergraduate students who have studied algebra-based or calculus-based physics through electricity and magnetism.   Using qualitative and quantitative analysis we seek evidence that these questions can help identify differences in reasoning with physics ideas along with strategies for using the questions to produce testable hypotheses about how subtle differences in questions can impact student reasoning.  This testing allows us to produce a useful tool for studying reasoning in physics education.

Introductory algebra-based physics courses frequently feature multiple student major populations in the same course section; however, different majors requirements may impact students' motivations towards different aspects of the course material, e.g. problem solving, and hence, impact course performance. A preliminary categorization of student attitudes towards a lab group coordinated problem solving exercise, in which students individually reflect on their group-based problem attempt, is based upon students written interpretations about the usefulness of the exercise: respectively towards intrinsic value of a problem solving framework, towards performing well in the course, and towards less specific aspects of the exercise.  The relationship between choice of major and this preliminary categorization for a typical algebra-based physics course is analyzed, as are trends by major and by category type in several measures of class performance. We also discuss more in-depth development of interpretation for the categorization construct via written artifacts from the problem solving exercise.

Following the creation of the Force Concept Inventory (FCI), many STEM discipline-based education researchers developed their own version of concept inventories.  To incorporate all types of concept inventories created; we introduce the terminology of Conceptual Learning Assessment Instruments (CLAIs). Previous research shows much variation between what is considered a CLAI and the type of evidence used to support the inferences made from the results of CLAIs. As part of our study, we began by creating the Conceptual Learning Assessment Inventory Methodology Survey (CLAIMS).  The CLAIMS was sent to developers of over 100 CLAIs identified via a systematic/ structured literature review. This poster discusses the research behind the CLAIMS as well as the preliminary results for the different CLAIs.  By comparing these methodologies and evidence collected, we hope to draw attention to differences both within disciplines and between fields.

Initial results will be described from an ongoing study that is investigating both academic and industrial career paths in optics and photonics. By grounding the discussion of workforce development in education research, we can have more productive discussions and a more accurate understanding of contentious topics such as skills gaps, shortages of skilled STEM workers, and similarities and differences between academic and industrial careers.  The study is refining our understanding about how specific math, physics, and communication skills are utilized in academic and industrial labs. Initial results indicate significant use of computational mathematics in the workplace and a span of communication modes that extends beyond technical writing, including group work, critiquing, one-on-one training, documenting, and more. The information should inform physics departments seeking to link their curriculum with students' future careers and serve as a case study for directly linking physics education research with national priorities in workforce development.

As part of a broader study aimed at understanding the first-year laboratory experience from various perspectives, we report on a pilot study in which we probed students perceptions of the first-year lab course at the end of the first term. For this purpose we developed a written instrument comprising five questions regarding the following areas of interest: expectations, enjoyment, learning, relation to course content, and assessment. Each question on the instrument is framed as a debate in which different points of view were posited. The respondents were requested to choose the view with which they most closely agreed (forced choice response), and more importantly, were directed to explain their choice in detail (free response writing). We detail the analysis and report on some of the preliminary findings focusing on the aspects of enjoyment and the learning experience

The Introductory Astronomy Questionnaire (IAQ) was translated into Norwegian and given in modified form to (i) 42 pre-service science teachers at the largest teacher-education institution in Norway, before and after instruction of an astronomy module, and (ii) 922 high-school students at different schools in Oslo, the Norwegian capital, 557 of them age 12-13 (before instruction of a physics/astronomy module), and 435 of them age 14-15 (post instruction). This poster presents a ranking task that probed students understanding of sizes and distances in the universe, along with detailed results. Unexpected findings include significant fractions of high-school students  both before and after instruction  thinking that the radius of the Earth is smaller than the height of the Earths atmosphere (>55%), that the Pole star is contained within the Solar System (>60%), and that planets are larger than stars (>40%). The pre-service teachers fared better pre-instruction, and also showed more significant gains post-instruction.

Transitioning from novice to expert often coincides with a better understanding of what it means to be an expert. An important open question is whether directly addressing the understanding of expertise can also enhance learning. We are studying first-generation and deaf and hard-of-hearing students participating in Project IMPRESS, a pre-matriculation program designed to encourage reflection and metacognitive practice. Students engaged in activities that focused on developing a definition of being an expert. Students first worked in small groups comparing definitions of black-body radiation written by novices and experts, although the students didn't know who wrote which definition. Students justified their beliefs about which papers they considered to be written by experts. This was followed by a class discussion in which a formal definition of what being an expert was formed. These activities were recorded and analyzed for changes in student discourse that indicate a growing understanding of expert-like thinking.

Many upper-division physics courses have as goals that students should think like a physicist.  Among other things, these goals include quantitative reasoning skills:  considering limiting cases, dimensional analysis, and using approximations.  However, there is often relatively little curricular support for these practices and many instructors do not assess them explicitly.  As part of a collaborative project to investigate student learning of mathematics in upper-division courses including the traditional math methods course, we have developed a number of written questions to investigate these skills.  Although there are limitations to assessing these skills with written questions, they can provide insight to the extent to which students can apply a given skill when prompted, even if they do not help understand how and when students choose to activate these skills.  Examples of student responses will be provided.

As a comprehensive PhysTEC site, Georgia State University has undertaken a reform of the calculus-based introductory physics sequence. The traditional three-hour lab was replaced with a one-hour tutorial led by an undergraduate learning assistant lead followed by a two-hour, guided inquiry lab led by a graduate teaching assistant. The guided inquiry labs for the first (mechanics) and second (E&M, optics) course in the sequence were tested with students in pilot sections in Spring 2014 and Fall 2014, respectively, and implemented for all classes in Fall 2014 and Spring 2015, respectively. The lab redesign is observed to have significant impacts on learning gains and student attitudes.  Design considerations, students perspectives on labs and learning gains of students with and without lab reform will be discussed.

Well-designed instructional simulations in the classroom can help students learn difficult concepts in an enjoyable way. The University of Colorado PhET simulations are some of the most widely used (15 million runs every year). We are investigating students' reasoning when working collaboratively on PhET simulations scaffolded by tutorial worksheets. We have developed a tutorial for the Gas Properties simulation for introductory physics students designed to solicit mechanistic reasoning about temperature and pressure in terms of molecular motion. However, in clinical and classroom settings, students working collaboratively on the tutorial used the ideal gas law to make predictions about situations in which an ideal gas is being compressed or heated and subsequently used the simulation to confirm their predictions. Many groups did not engage in discussing the temperature, pressure or work done in terms of the molecular motion. These results informed subsequent modifications. We will present preliminary results of our investigations.

Research-based	concept inventories, like the FCI or BEMA, are tools for instructional change.  To increase the efficacy of these tools, faculty need to compare their students scores to students like theirs: historical data from their own instruction, data from other institutions like theirs, and data from similar teaching methods. Ordinary faculty dont have time to delve into diverse research literature to find comparison data, which may not even match their instructional environments.  The research record oversamples research-intensive universities; most physics students enroll at community colleges, small schools, and regional comprehensives. At PhysPort, we are engaged in multiple complementary efforts to help faculty use and understand research-based assessment. PhysPorts Data Explorer is a tool that can be used by instructors at any institution to calculate and compare scores on concept inventories.  We conduct research on how faculty interact with the Data Explorer and the rest of PhysPort.  Instructors appreciated the ease of use and the ability to visualize grade distributions as well as the easy comparison with different classes.

Professional development workshops, like the the Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshop (NFW), are commonly used to promote the adoption and adaption of research-based instructional strategies. After attending workshops, faculty are often motivated to modify and adapt these strategies within their classrooms, but may be underprepared to do so in ways likely to maintain the intended student outcomes. We study the NFW using a real-time professional development observation tool and case study analysis. We show how the tool allows workshop leaders to formatively assess the prevalence of lecture and what goals could plausibly be met through their workshop design. We also analyze faculty engaging in a task as physics students, and find that their interactions poorly represent what we would like them to foster in their own classrooms. This suggests that if faculty are to learn to better faciliate group work based on these experiences, guided reflection may be necessary.

To provide opportunities for students to engage meaningfully with core disciplinary concepts and practices in physics, an introductory calculus-based mechanics course was designed for students to collaborate in small groups to solve complex problems.  Our research focuses on how discourse between members in one group reflected the expected role(s) in the class that members perceived for themselves and their peers.  We discuss how those expectations were enacted by group members to position themselves and each other in ways that afforded and constrained their opportunities to learn and do physics in class.  We attend to how one student, Kathy, responded to the positionings by her group members.  Qualitative methods were used to analyze video-recorded small group discussions over a four-week period.  Preliminary findings indicate that the role(s) each group member, including Kathy, perceived for him/herself and their peers afforded and constrained Kathys engagement with learning physics in the class.

Responsive Teaching is a philosophy which focuses on instructors' in-the-moment responses to students' emerging ideas, and the structural decisions about classroom climate and activities which promote student agency and inquiry.  It is unexplored in the highly canonized and content-driven upper-division context.  In this study, we develop a case study of responsive teaching in an upper-division electromagnetic fields course.  Through artifact analysis of lesson plans, discourse analysis classroom video of events, and reflective interviews with the instructor, we show interactional and structural features of the classroom which promote students' agency as pre-service physicists.

We estimate that new teachers who attend the summer institutes received at least 133 hours of professional development involvement this past year (70 h, summer; 63 h, grade-level meetings; up to 96 h, CFA analyses; and staff classroom visits and voluntary attendance at professional society meetings).

Students sense of self-efficacy and belonging may be situated in many environments in a college setting. Two surveys that measure students feelings of self-efficacy and belonging within their STEM and campus communities were administered to over 550 introductory level, calculus based, physics students at West Virginia University (WVU) during the spring 2015 semester. An exploratory factor analysis was performed to determine the important elements of self-efficacy and belonging that are prevalent among incoming students in STEM fields. We will discuss the breakdown of these elements as they pertain to the physics sequence, classes within the students major, perceptions of the students future career, and the WVU campus community. The notable correlations between these elements will also be presented. This project provides further opportunities to explore the development of student feelings of self-efficacy and belonging and how they relate to STEM retention and performance.

As part of a broader research project to investigate how and when in-class science engagement transfers to out-of-school settings, a particular phenomenon of interest deals with students choosing to share their science learning with family and friends.  Based on written responses to surveys and interviews with students enrolled in undergraduate science courses, I share and analyze examples of students sharing their science learning with family and friends. These examples highlight the role that positive self-efficacy and pride play in motivating students choice to engage family and friends and also how students satisfaction in doing so can be influenced by the interest, capability, and knowledge differential of their interlocutors.

In science courses, measures of self-efficacy have been positively correlated with increased student persistence in the face of obstacles, improved academic performance, as well as greater likelihood of pursuing science degrees. Certain classroom interactions may contribute to self-efficacy through one of four recognized sources, two of whichverbal persuasion and vicarious learningare highly social in nature. In this study, we looked for relationships between academic classroom interactions and student self-efficacy in a 73-student introductory Modeling Instruction physics course at Florida International University. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to calculate various centrality measuresproxies for students position in the academic social network of the classroom. Multiple linear regression models revealed the predictive power of network centrality on students self-efficacy as measured by the Sources of Self-Efficacy in Science Courses-Physics survey. The results of the analyses provide new insight into the dynamic interactions occurring in active-learning physics courses.

As part of ongoing research in teaching and learning quantum mechanics using the Spin First approach, we are investigating student learning of basic introductory quantum concepts in sophomore level Modern Physics courses at Cal poly Pomona. In the Spin First approach, postulates of quantum mechanics are introduced in the context of Stern-Gerlach experiments with discrete spin-half bases. We have collected QMCA posttest data for several sophomore level classes using either Spin First or traditional approaches in teaching quantum concepts. We will share the results and discuss the implications for instructors of introductory quantum courses.

Past findings analyzing student difficulties reasoning with data showed that in graphed and pictured cases students were much more likely to incorrectly reason about situations in which a variable has no relationship or an unknown (data is not conclusive) relationship with another variable. Expanding on this, students were given graphs with more data points and multiple trend-lines. Students were also given a larger variety of pictured experiments. Student responses about these more detailed graphs and pictures support original findings and allow for some additional distinctions. In addition, students were asked to create their own graphs. These graphs tended to be either a line-graph with legend, like the graphs given in the original study, or a bar-graph with clusters that showed the third variable. Students graph style did not affect their ability to answer line-graph questions. Lastly, I present changes to student reasoning and responses from a small teaching intervention.

We report findings from an investigation of student difficulties using boundary conditions in electrodynamics, an important topic that advanced physics undergraduates are expected to understand and apply. Our data sources include traditional exam questions, conceptual survey questions, and think-aloud student interviews. The analysis was guided by an analytical framework that characterizes how students activate, construct, execute, and reflect on boundary conditions. Common student difficulties include: activating boundary conditions in appropriate contexts; constructing a complex expression for the E&M waves; mathematically simplifying complex exponentials and checking if the reflection and transmission coefficient are physical. Finally, we present tentative pedagogical implications based on our observations.

Complex numbers and functions are used in multiple subdisciplines in the undergraduate physics curriculum. We are beginning to explore middle-division student difficulties with complex numbers, complex functions, and their applications within physics. Here we use pretests, quizzes, and exams which were administered throughout the junior year to identify student difficulties. These difficulties are classified into three categories: performing calculations involving complex numbers, switching between forms of complex numbers, and appropriately selecting forms of complex numbers to simplify calculations. Our exploration suggests that students in middle-division physics courses have varying levels of fluency with complex number manipulations and that these difficulties tend to persist over time.

Separation of variables can be a powerful technique for solving many of the partial differential equations that arise in physics contexts.  Upper-division physics students encounter this technique in multiple topical areas including electrostatics and quantum mechanics.  To better understand the difficulties students encounter when utilizing the separation of variables technique, we examined responses to midterm exam questions and conceptual assessments, and conducted think-aloud, problem-solving interviews.  Our analysis was guided by an analytical framework that focuses on how students activate, construct, execute, and reflect on the separation of variables technique when solving physics problems.  Here we focus on student difficulties with separation of variables as a technique to solve Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates in the context of junior-level electrostatics.  Challenges include: recognizing when separation of variables is the appropriate tool, identifying implicit boundary conditions, and spontaneously reflecting on their solutions.

Quantum mechanics is challenging even for advanced undergraduate and graduate students. We have been investigating the difficulties that students have in determining the probability of measuring position and energy as a function of time when the initial wavefunction is explicitly given. We administered written free-response and multiple-choice questions to investigate the difficulties advanced students have with these concepts. We find that many students struggle with these concepts. We will present the findings.

Measuring student engagement is often looked at as an in-class activity only. However, looking at students involvement in their courses beyond the classroom reveals hidden dynamics factoring into students learning. Course Networking (CN) is a course management system (CMS) designed to provide a medium for students to engage socially/academically outside of the classroom. In our study, we utilized both qualitative and quantitative research techniques to evaluate each students engagement outside of the course.  By comparing this evaluation to the students respective grades we hope to determine if there is any correlation between CN use and final course grade.

The Colorado Classical Mechanics/Math Methods Instrument (CCMI) is an open-ended assessment designed to investigate student skills in upper-division classical mechanics.  With a large number of student responses compiled (N=443), we conducted an analysis of student written work to identify student ideas and trends in student difficulties.  Here, we present our examination of student responses to one CCMI question that targets vector decomposition in multiple coordinate systems. Through iterative and cooperative efforts to hand-code student responses, we identified common patterns in students final expressions, resulting in broad categories. We identified approaches to the problem inferred from features of student solutions. For example, when decomposing a velocity vector in a Cartesian coordinate system, we found that students either differentiated a position vector or used trigonometry to visualize the components. We observed that certain approaches more commonly resulted in particular errors. Investigating productive student approaches is a step towards pedagogical improvement.

When physics students are asked to measure the distance between two fixed locations using a pre-defined wavelength as a ruler, there is a surprising failure rate, at least partially due to the fact that the ``ruler'' to be used is not fixed in length (see ``Is a Simple Measurement Task a Roadblock to Student Understanding of Wave Phenomena?,'' by M. Kryjevskaia, M. Stetzer, and P. Heron, The Physics Teacher 51,560, (2103) and references therein). I will show some data from introductory classes (algebra- and calculus-based) that replicate this latter result, and also show some interesting features when comparing settings involving slinkies with setting involving surface waves on water. Finally, I approach the larger question of how to develop expert-like behavior such as checking-a-plausible-answer in novices.

Student reasoning on physics problems is often context dependent, and students may reason very differently when answering analogous questions targeting the same concept. A possible explanation is that salient distracting features (SDFs) in physics problems may cue students spontaneous reasoning.  Students often accept this cued reasoning without question, even though it may be unproductive and preclude the use of relevant knowledge.  Research suggests that strengthening students metacognitive skills may help address these difficulties, although little work has focused on the role that metacognitive knowledge can play in student reasoning. This paper describes preliminary results from an interview-based instructional intervention aimed not only at developing students metacognitive knowledge of SDFs and the role SDFs may play in cueing reasoning but also how this knowledge can be applied. Preliminary results suggest students are able to identify SDFs and associated reasoning in physics problems, but struggle to recognize the productiveness of this endeavor.

Understanding and relating concepts and problem-solving strategies is a common difficulty for students in introductory Algebra-based physics courses.  We investigate students understandings of electric field concepts and problem-solving skills for an introductory Algebra-based Electricity, Magnetism and Optics studio-mode course.  Continuing our study from previous semesters, we present student responses to a common question asked on the exams in Fall 2014 and Spring 2015 semesters, focusing on students skills in electric field analyses.  The classes had a maximum enrollment of 99 students and were taught by the same instructor. Comparisons of student performance will be made to a past semester electric field question that was a variant to that of the present study. Emphasis is also placed on students understanding of vector math.

Undergraduate physics students are known to have difficulties with understanding mathematical tools, and with applying their knowledge of mathematics to physical contexts.  Using survey statements based on open-ended questions and student interviews, we investigated the prevalence of correct and incorrect conceptions regarding the divergence and curl of vector fields among both mathematics and physics students.  We find significant differences in the survey responses given by physics majors and mathematics majors enrolled in the same vector calculus course.  We also compare pre- and post-instruction responses from students taking intermediate-level electromagnetism courses at the University of St Andrews and KU Leuven.  Although their understanding of the divergence and curl improved, relatively few electromagnetism students were able to provide completely correct survey responses at mid-semester.

Evidence suggests that a major obstacle to student success in the construction of physics integrals is an inability to formulate and interpret differentials and products involving differentials. To address these issues, we conducted a controlled experiment at the introductory level to help students practice the construction and explore the physical meaning of differentials. This between-students design featured pairs of similarly-styled training tasks that varied by physical context, either on paper without feedback or on a computer with electronic feedback. The training contexts included kinematics (e.g., Velocity vs. Time), dynamics (e.g., Force vs. Position), gases, and mass densities. A post-test featuring all physical contexts and several transfer questions was given to all conditions. Our results demonstrated that some physical training contexts produced significantly different post-test scores. Furthermore, training conditions featuring electronic feedback yielded significantly higher post-test scores than both the control and several no-feedback conditions.

The relationship between light and energy is important for understanding a variety of physics concepts and shows up in many introductory physics courses. Using free-response conceptual questions in an algebra-based introductory physics course, we found that even pre-instruction, students can rank the types of light on the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., X-rays, microwaves, etc.) in terms of their energy and frequency. They appear to draw on knowledge from personal experience, as well as previous classes, to justify their claims. However, we also see evidence that some students connect light energy to kinetic energy and therefore, claim that different types of light travel at different speeds. This is despite often explicitly stating that all travel at the speed of light. These results are consistent with the knowledge-in-pieces framework that claims that students may have correct pieces of knowledge, but may inappropriately apply them in certain contexts or may not reconcile conflicting ideas.

Although online video content naturally lends itself to demonstrating physics concepts in online instructional settings, growing technology makes it possible to provide online instruction that guides students through hands-on laboratory-like experiences at home. The manipulability and kinesthetic nature of hands-on microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) activities, particularly for mechanics topics, make them theoretically more conducive to the formation of meaningful connections between real world actions and physics relationships. We seek to take advantage of these cognitive benefits by exploring the use of online MBL activities as a tool to introduce to new material. In a recent clinical study, students received instruction in one-dimensional kinematics in both video and hands-on activity formats in varying order. We will present the results of this study, including student engagement with the material, and implications for the use of dorm room physics as an instructional tool.

We are studying the different paths students take throughout the Physics undergraduate program of Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). Between 2002 and 2013, 176 students, 159 men and 17 women, declared themselves as Physics majors. 84, however, left and received their degree from another program (we only include the students who received their degree). We are focus on these 84 students, looking at the last classes they take before they leave the Physics program, their performances in their classes, and where they go. We are particularly interested in the paths of women, deaf/hard of hearing students, and those from other underrepresented groups, and we are developing effective graphics to represent these data.

The development of a student's sense of ownership in project based laboratory courses has been increasingly recognized as an important factor in student success as well as an important part of becoming a scientist in an authentic research setting. For this reason some laboratory instructors have defined Project Ownership as a central learning goal for their courses. Our aim was to investigate the concept of student ownership in the context of an upper-division optical physics laboratory course in which students spend the final seven weeks of the semester working in groups on a final project of their choosing. We've drawn on two data sources: (1) results of the Survey on Project Ownership, administered at the end of the course and (2) weekly student reflections about their goals, challenges, and successes. Our analysis probes connections between student ownership and other relevant aspects of the final project experience, including student affect, agency, and self-efficacy as well as their interactions with peers and instructors. Comparison of reflections made during the first and second halves of the project provided the opportunity to investigate the evolution of ownership during the course and has revealed several promising avenues for future study of the dynamic process through which students develop a sense of ownership over their projects in such a setting.

Students' diagnostic performance when reviewing solutions, examined through tasks requiring them to identify and explain their mistakes, is known to be generally poor.
We hypothesized that troubleshooting activities would improve students' diagnostic ability if they consist of 1) Principle-based diagnosis: identifying and explaining misinterpreted concepts and principles underlying mistakes in teacher made solutions (attributed to an imaginary student). 2) Feedback: comparing student's diagnosis to exemplary Principle-based diagnosis. 
As part of a larger study to examine this hypothesis, we analyzed diagnostic performance in a 10th grade class (N=35), that carried out four such troubleshooting activities in the topic of optics. The intervention was carried out in a private school in the Arab sector in Israel, and lasted 4 month. We will present findings regarding students' performance before and after the intervention: their ability to identify and explain misinterpreted concepts (diagnosis stage); to provide corrected solutions; and to solve transfer problems.

Upper-division physics courses require the use of sophisticated mathematics. In introductory physics, studies have shown that students often lack conceptual understanding of calculus concepts and struggle to implement calculus tools. Research into students understanding and use of mathematics in upper-level courses is in its early stages. To further this research, we have observed students engaged in group problem-solving during weekly recitation sessions for an upper-division electricity and magnetism course. Early in the course, one task required students to use a Dirac delta function (DDF) to write an expression for the charge density on the surface of a charged hollow cylinder. We report on two group discussions where different students gave a variety of explanations about the purpose of a DDF in this context. By examining these explanations, we can determine the types of understanding students have about DDFs and which are most productive for their use in physics contexts.

Modern equipment, such as tablets and interactive whiteboards, allows an investigative and hand-on approach to new topics. The poster will present how small groups of high-school students engaged in the investigation of planetary motion by creating and throwing planets into orbits around the Sun. We were particularly interested in how students communicated within the group during the investigative activity. We have seen that hand gestures played a central role in their discussions. The poster will address the role of gesture in scientific discourse and show and analyze examples of students' hand gestures from the observed activities. We argue that an environment that catalyzes student use of gesture is a good starting point for engaging students in scientific discourse.

This study explores students approaches to handling synthesis problems with 3 levels of mathematical complexity: simplest to most complex whereby the equations become increasingly more complex while the physics remains the same. Individual interviews were conducted with 13 students. Based on the written solutions and interview responses, four main profiles emerged, providing a holistic view of the students approaches to solving the synthesis problems: (i) Trial and Error; (ii) Flawed Reasoning; (iii) Knowledgeable, and (iv) Expert approach. Students who attempted the simplest problem tend to use the Knowledgeable or Expert strategy. Those who solved the complex and most complex tasks employed the Trial and Error or Flawed Reasoning approach. Regardless of the tasks mathematical complexity, the students were able to recognize the relevant concepts. However, they failed to correctly apply these concepts with the occurrence of the same kinds of physics mistakes across the three versions of the task.

Group work is becoming increasingly common in introductory physics classrooms. Understanding how students engage in these group learning environments is important for designing and facilitating productive learning opportunities for students.  We conducted an exploratory study in which we collected video of groups of introductory physics students working on conceptual electricity and magnetism problems.  In this setting, students must negotiate a common understanding and coordinate group decisions in order to complete the activity successfully. We observed students engaging in several distinct modes of collaboration while solving these problems. Closer analysis of these observations has been focused on identifying these different modes of collaboration and articulating what defines each one. We present preliminary analysis of a small number of videos that will inform future work, including identifying new modes and determining how different modes may be related.

The Mathematization project investigates students use of mathematical tools across the undergraduate physics curriculum. As a part of that project, we investigate how intermediate mechanics students use those tools in traditional homework problems, and what evidence we have of their tool use in their written solutions. We use the modified version of the ACER framework to analyze students solutions. We generalize across students and problems to build patterns of mathematical tool use on traditional problems.  We use techniques borrowed from network analysis and the Resources Framework to build a fingerprint of students mathematical tool use in intermediate mechanics. In this poster, we present preliminary findings of patterns in students problem solving.

Students enter their physics and physical science classes with a wealth of knowledge and pre-conceived beliefs.  There has been much work to understand these beliefs in terms of content, but not as much with the representations used to describe that content.  We investigate how students view Free-Body Diagrams before they receive instruction on how to construct and use them in a physical science course and then again after they had several weeks of instruction.  Our results show that students initially viewed the forces as being created by a person and that diagrams were typically an overhead view.  After instruction, forces were created both from objects and people and the diagrams were a side view of the scenario not an overhead.

UMd-PERG's NEXUS/Physics for Life Sciences laboratory curriculum, piloted in 2012-2013 in small test classes, has been implemented in large-enrollment environments at UMD in 2013-Present, and adopted at several institutions (including TYCs, R-1 universities, and small 4-year colleges). These labs address physical issues at biological scales using microscopy, image and video analysis, electrophoresis, and spectroscopy in an open, non-protocol-driven environment. We have collected a wealth of data (surveys, video analysis, etc.) that enables us to get a sense of the students' responses to this curriculum at UMD. We also have survey data from some of the initial adopting institutions. In this poster, we will provide a broad overview of what we have learned and a comparison of our large-enrollment results and the results from "first adopter" institutions to the results from our pilot study. Special emphasis will be placed on successes and challenges accompanying this scaling-up, both at UMD and beyond.

The Introductory Astronomy Questionnaire (IAQ) was translated into Norwegian and given in adapted form to 42 pre-service science teachers at the largest teacher education institution in Norway. The IAQ was administered before and after instruction of a 12-hour astronomy module. One question prompted students to explain the difference between astronomy and astrology and another question probed students understanding of the Big Bang as a theory. In both questions, students were asked to "write a detailed account of what they would have said to three year 10 students discussing these topics. In the pre-test, 18 (46%) and 14 (36%) students respectively responded in a pedagogical manner, displaying a clear focus on helping students learn. The remaining answers were written in an expert voice that did not make reference to the hypothetical students. In the post-test, however, only 2 (5%) and 5 (14%) students respond as teachers and the rest as experts.

The Maine Physical Science Partnership (NSF #0962805) is a professional development program for K-12 science teachers. We analyzed a cohort meeting were teachers analyzed their own responses to a set of four open-ended questions from pre-vious years regarding a specific energy scenario. We observed changes in their conceptual understanding and the way they analyzed the data. Teachers moved from an evaluative mind set, focusing on the flaws of the responses or missing parts in the responses, towards the recognition of the resources shown in each response. By combining two responses they created their own refined answer for the question evaluated. While evaluating their colleagues responses teachers detached the per-son from the answer but when they were recognizing the valuable resources they recognized the person behind the idea. We observed that the discussion of teachers answers with other teachers allowed for development of content knowledge.

Discussions, whether in small or large groups, are one of the cornerstones of learning through engaging in scientific disciplinary practices. They provide opportunities for teachers to explore student understanding, and for students to co-construct physics principles from evidence-supported claims. However, it is not always obvious how to best facilitate these discussions in a way that supports students' epistemic agency. Oftentimes, the classroom settles into the convention that the teacher is the epistemic authority. This study explores teachers and students moves during consensus discussions within the Physics and Everyday Thinking (PET) curriculum. Teacher and student moves were analyzed for how they promote or constrain students participation in dialogic discourse. We will discuss specific moves that supported and enhanced students' epistemic agency and authority, as well as moves that could constrain rich student conversations. Finally, we propose strategies based on this research for facilitating discussions and pitfalls teachers may want to avoid.

Physics education research has consistently shown that students have higher student learning outcomes when enrolled in interactive-engagement courses. At San Jos� State University, the interactive sections (labs and workshops) of our introductory physics courses are mostly taught by graduate student teaching assistants (TAs). While some research has been done to determine how best to prepare TAs for their teaching assignments, remarkably little has been done to monitor how interactive that classroom time actually is. Over the course of one semester, we observed the majority of the TAs in their teaching roles: both as laboratory instructors and problem-solving workshop leaders. Observations were conducted for the first hour of instruction using the Real-time Instructor Observation Tool (RIOT), logging a variety of TA-student interactions in real time. We present the results from over 20 observation hours of these interactions and compare these data with known best practices.

A number of educational strategies and tools have been designed to improve physics education for undergraduate students. Physics Education Technology (PhET) is a recent technology based on interactive simulations that provides the possibility to experiment real world phenomena without the need for laboratory equipment. Likewise, Tutorials for Introductory Physics have been proved to be one of the best research based strategies that promotes conceptual understanding.  We worked with engineering students in a Chilean private university who are not familiar with PhETs but somewhat with Tutorials. We examined student conceptual learning of electric circuits concepts, obtained from students when they use two Tutorials with PhETs instead of real equipment. We report results of their learning and behavior from pre-post tests, review of documents and observation. We note the benefits of using technology combined with research based strategies in positively influencing students learning and interactive engagement, both individually and collaboratively.

Building off CPlite from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), Purdue University developed the Computerized Homework in Physics (CHIP) system in 1997. Due to its success at Purdue, we are developing a Computerized Interactive Teaching Assistant (CITA) for the next generation of CHIP. We aim to extend the ideas behind the interactive examples created at UIUC, raising them to a higher level of interaction between the students and the online learning tool, by applying the current findings of multimedia learning and physics education research. Unlike most computerized homework systems for physics that only provide students with a "correct" or "incorrect" response to their answers, the CITA program will guide students through fundamental concepts and appropriate problem solving techniques. It will provide students with dynamic feedback to their responses, thus allowing them to learn from their mistakes as they analyze each problem.

Administration of the CLASS, for example, indicates greater positive shifts in real-world connections for the section using smartphones.

Increasing student retention and persistence - in particular classes or in their major area of study - is a challenge for universities. Students' academic and social integration into an institution is vital to student retention, yet, research on the effect of interpersonal interactions is rare. Social network analysis is an approach that can be used to identify patterns of interaction that contribute to integration into the university. We analyze how a student's position within a social network in a Modeling Instruction (MI) course that strongly emphasizes interactive learning, and how their position impacts persistence in taking a subsequent MI course. We find that students with higher centrality at the end of the first semester of MI are in fact more likely to enroll in a second semester of MI. While the correlation with increased persistence is an ongoing study, these findings suggest that student social integration, in fact, influences persistence.

Students in physics laboratory courses, particularly at the upper division, are often expected to engage in troubleshooting.  Although there are numerous ways in which students may proceed when diagnosing a problem, not all approaches are equivalent in terms of providing meaningful insight.  It is reasonable to believe that metacognition, by assisting students in making informed decisions, is an integral component of effective troubleshooting.  We report on an investigation of authentic student troubleshooting in the context of junior-level electronics at two institutions.  Think-aloud interviews were conducted with pairs of students as they attempted to repair a malfunctioning operational-amplifier circuit.  Video data from the interviews have been analyzed to examine the relationship between each groups troubleshooting activities and instances of socially mediated metacognition.  We present an analysis of a short episode from one interview.

Representations such as graphs, pictures, words, and equations play a crucial role in the pedagogy of introductory physics.  Activities such as labs and tutorials often require students to analyze and produce these representations.  We investigate the use of representations in a variety of activities.  Specifically, we examine both labs and tutorials as well as both evidence-based and non-evidence-based activities.  We define evidence-based activities as those that have been connected with positive learning outcomes in published research articles.  Our evidenced-based activities are inspired by physics education research, while our non-evidence-based activities are more traditional.  We compare and contrast the use of representations among these types of activities.  We investigate several uses of representations, including representations produced by the student; representations provided by the activity; and representations that the student re-examines at a later point in the activity.

Encouraging students to write their own multiple-choice questions is a valuable academic exercise, placing high cognitive demands on the learner.  Students must be able to synthesize course materials to construct a question, provide plausible distractors (wrong answers) and explain their answers.

A popular online question generation application is PeerWise. PeerWise enables students to provide feedback to question authors in the form of comments. Providing feedback encourages students to think critically about their peers? submissions; to problem solve by suggesting possible improvements; and to reflect upon their own performance in light of these processes, enhancing their understanding.

Three main research questions are addressed:

1.    What types of comments do students write?
2.    Which type of comment is most strongly associated with exam
       performance?
3.    Is writing high quality comments associated with exam

Students learning attitude about a course will obviously affect their learning activity and further the learning outcomes. As a step of an outcome-based teaching reform, carrying out of a survey on students learning attitude should be an effective approach to understand students activity in a laboratory course and to collect hints for further effort during the following teaching practice. 
With the help from PER groups at UCB and RIT, the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS) questionnaire has been translated into Chinese and put online this semester. Students in different years taking physics lab course in our teaching lab were all encouraged to complete the questionnaire. 
We report on the initial results based on the samples collected this semester. Students specialty, year as well as the gender will be taken as parameters to divide students into groups. Analysis will be carried out to see the common and diverse attitudes among these groups. We will further discuss the difference between attitudes of the Chinese students and attitudes of the students in USA. A brief comment on the further implementation of this survey in Chinese institutions, as well as suggestions of some modification, will also be presented.

In active engagement physics classrooms, such as the Tutorials in Physics Sensemaking, students get opportunities to make sense of physics together.  They do not always take up these opportunities, in part because of the risk of sharing their ideas and having them rejected by their classmates or the instructors.  We analyze video of three tutorial groups to investigate how students manage these risks in creating a safe space to sensemake.  We find that the students and instructors alike rely on a common discursive resource  epistemic distancing  to share their ideas while protecting themselves affectively if others disagree.  Epistemic distancing includes hedging, joking, deferring, and other discourse moves used to soften ones stance in conversation.  We use video analysis to illustrate the effects of these moves on tutorial groups sensemaking discussions, and discuss implications for instructors wishing to encourage sensemaking discussions in their physics classrooms.

Swarthmore College life science students take a traditional first semester physics course, but have the option of taking an innovative Introductory Physics for the Life Sciences (IPLS) course in the second semester. This curricular structure presents a unique opportunity to compare students experiences across these different instructional environments. We have used multiple conceptual and attitudinal survey instruments, and have interviewed a number of students over the course of the year, in an effort to assess students evolving relationship with physics across these two different experiences. In this talk we present some of our findings from these survey and interview data, comparing epistemological and affective features of students experiences across the traditional and IPLS environments. This comparison allows us to identify some of the features that students find especially engaging about the IPLS course in particular.

P3 is a new introductory mechanics course at Michigan State University that has been piloted during the fall/spring semesters of 2014/2015. An important focus of the P3 classroom is the development of scientific practices. However, it is difficult for students to learn scientific practices, such as communicating scientific information or constructive argumentation, without feedback based on observing students engaging in these practices. As part of the instruction and assessment in P3, students are provided with feedback that provides students with a weekly score and commentary that is aimed at guiding the students in the appropriation of scientific practices. Taking an action research approach to the design of the P3 curriculum student interviews have been conducted aimed at obtaining students reflections of different aspects of the class design to inform further iterations. This poster explores students reflections on the feedback aspect of the class and the difficulties they encountered.

Troubleshooting systems is integral to experimental physics in both research and instructional laboratory settings. The recently adopted AAPT Lab Guidelines identify student ability to troubleshoot as an important learning outcome of the undergraduate physics laboratory curriculum. The Experimental Modeling Framework--which describes physicists use of mathematical and conceptual models when reasoning about experimental systems--is a useful lens through which to characterize the troubleshooting process and, ultimately, to inform educational activities that develop troubleshooting skills in physics. Upper-division electronics labs are an ideal context for studying students' troubleshooting abilities, due in part to the simplicity of the physical systems and models with which students interact and the ease with which components can be replaced. Using data collected in think-aloud interviews, in which pairs of students attempt to diagnose and repair a malfunctioning circuit, we describe the application of the Experimental Modeling Framework to the troubleshooting context.

This poster describes a whole-class whiteboard meeting and gives two examples from a calculus-based introductory physics course taught using modeling instruction.  Students in one section were divided into six groups of 4-5 students each.  Each group created a solution to the same problem on a 2x 3 whiteboard.  The groups then formed a large circle in the center of the classroom with their whiteboards resting against their knees facing in to the rest of the group.  The instructor was outside the circle and interjected rarely.  Examples are given of conversations where students overcome sharp initial disagreements to eventually reach whole-class consensus. The first example gives a more in-depth analysis of a previously discussed conversation, while the second example presents initial analysis of a new conversation.  Students are learning the epistemology of science by actively engaging in it every class.

Collaborative learning environments in undergraduate introductory physics courses, such as those promoted by Modeling Instruction (MI), influence both student performance and student social interactions. Because collaborative learning is inherently a social activity, we apply Network Analysis methods to examine student social interactions within the classroom using a survey administered periodically in class. We then calculate centrality, a family of measures that quantify how connected or central a particular student is within the classroom social network. In order to understand what centrality means in this context, we investigate the relationship among centrality, student demographics, and student outcomes in a large-scale MI classroom with 70 students and 6 instructors. We address two research questions: Does centrality depend on sex, ethnicity, incoming GPA, or FMCE pre-score? and Does centrality predict final grade in course or FMCE post-score?

Learning quantum mechanics requires students to develop not only new mathematical skills but also new ways of thinking about foundational concepts. Towards this instructional goal, we seek to unpack the nuanced and dynamic nature of student ontologies. We examine video data from a focus group of students enrolled in our transformed Modern Physics for Engineers course at the University of Colorado Boulder that explicitly addresses interpretation of quantum phenomena. We analyze a student discussion about the nature of photons using the conceptual blending framework of Fauconnier and Turner (2002). We find that in the discussion, classical ontologies of particles and waves act as input spaces from which a new blended space of photon emerges; this blend incorporates the transfer of some particle and wave properties to a new entity. When elaborating on these blended concepts, the students engage in metacognitive thinking as they negotiate the emergent meaning surrounding their ideas.

Educational psychology studies have linked self-belief constructs to success in STEM, including self-efficacy (the belief in ones ability to succeed at specific tasks) and growth mindset (seeing intelligence as something that can be developed through dedication and effort). However, most of the work with these constructs uses traditional psychology large-N quantitative studies to show that change happens without describing in qualitative detail the mechanism by which it happens. This presentation will focus on a case study of a student who sees herself as competent in neuroscience, identifies as a math person, but still places physics in a category of special difficulty. Evidence from this case suggests receiving grade-based evidence of her capability in physics is insufficient for impacting her self-beliefs in physics. We explore ways in which a nuanced understanding of how a sense of capability develops helps us understand this students disciplinary self-efficacy.

Effectively teaching an Introductory Physics for the Life Sciences (IPLS) course means engaging life science students in a subject for which they may not have considerable preexisting interest. We have found that the inclusion of authentic life science examples supports students whose initial interest in physics is less developed, but that different examples and models vary in their effectiveness at engaging student interest. In this talk we begin to unpack this variability, exploring why some life science examples may be more successful than others at sparking and sustaining student interest. By analyzing data from (1) survey instruments assessing student interest in particular life science examples, and (2) interviews conducted with students before and after instruction, we identify features of our IPLS course that appear to be particularly important for fostering student engagement. We suggest that some of these features might also foster student interest in more traditional introductory physics courses.

As part of a larger study on how students' mathematical skills co-develop with their physics identities, we examine students' problem solving in upper-division Quantum Mechanics.  We collected video data of students in-class group problem solving sessions.  Using the Resources Framework coupled with discourse analysis, we look for violations of students' expectations in quantum mechanics and associated mathematics, then look for how they might have developed those expectations and how they resolve the violations.  In this poster, we present some case studies of students engaged with complex exponentials and oscillations, linear combinations of stationary states, and normalization for time-dependent wavefunctions.

We will report results from a study which used eye tracking technology to investigate how introductory students and graduate students viewed and interpreted motion graphs. Participants viewed several graphs of position, velocity, or acceleration versus time on a computer screen and were asked to match a region of the graph with a description of the objects motion. We will compare performance on the questions with audio-recorded explanations and eye movements recorded using an eye tracker.

While using a standardized concept inventory before and after instruction to evaluate a course is standard, previous research* shows that existing concept inventories are not appropriate for use with Matter and Interactions courses. As an alternative, we have utilized Primary-Trait-Analysis (PTA) since 2012 to evaluate our reformed Matter and Interaction Modern Mechanics course at Purdue University. To utilize PTA, we identified the core concepts (primary traits) covered within the course. With this technique, we then total the percentage points scored for each trait on each exam. Finally we normalize these scores by the test averages. This allowed us to judge the success of the course at teaching the different concepts. Results from multiple semesters will be presented

This poster will describe a case study involving an integrated calculus-physics course that has been taught at Creighton University since 2011 using project-based learning pedagogy.  The course consists of calculus II paired with general physics I (mechanics) in the fall, following by calculus III (multi-variable) paired with general physics II (E&M and waves), and is team-taught by faculty members from both mathematics and physics.    The effectiveness of project-based pedagogy in such a course will be described, as well as lessons learned regarding project-design and student teaming.  A chief component of the course is the deliberate and methodological development of student self-directed and self-regulated learning skills.  Student reflections and data from a newly developed self-directed learning survey will be presented.

As a part of the evaluation of the project Inquiry Model for Professional Action and Content-rich Teaching III (IMPACT III), the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP) (Piburn, et. al., 2000) was used to observe the classrooms of participating teachers. These observations were used to characterize the classrooms both qualitatively and quantitatively. There were a total of three different observing periods with a minimum of twenty-one RTOP observations per period. The RTOP results over the three observation periods ranged from an initial average RTOP score of 37.5 � 12.3 to a final average RTOP score of 47.8 � 18.7.  The final average RTOP score of 47.8 indicated about a half of the classrooms observed in the final period were reformed. There was a significant difference from the initial observation period RTOP scores and the third observation period RTOP scores. IMPACT III appeared to reform teacher practice and improve teacher pedagogical knowledge.

In the context of a road accident prevention program for students in the age of 16-18 years, conducted by the state police of Northrhine-Westphalia in Germany, a physics lecture was developed to further change students beliefs about road safety.
The lecture consisted of different work assignments (computer simulation as well as pencil and paper worksheets) for small groups of students, all about various physical aspects of road traffic.
This lecture was evaluated in a Pre-Post-Design, just before the prevention program, two weeks later and three months later. The results showed that a significant change in students beliefs in a desired direction occurred. 

In the poster, the development process (based on the design-based-research process) of this lecture will be shown. All stages of the development, especially the statistic findings are depicted. Further implications of the evaluation of this lecture will also be shown.

The dissemination and implementation of student-centered teaching practices in college STEM courses remains an unsolved problem in education research. Despite research indicating positive student learning outcomes, most college STEM courses are traditional lectures. Our research team developed The Student Participation Observation Tool (SPOT), an innovative web-based application developed based on observable classroom actions aligned with research-based instructional practices in order to facilitate faculty reflection on their teaching practice and potentially promote reform. In this presentation I describe the impacts of a faculty development workshop where university STEM faculty used SPOT in conjunction with reflective dialogue to aid them in identifying their current and desired teaching practices. Faculty participated in this 5-part workshop series that included three group meetings and two classroom observations. Analysis of workshop data (artifacts, transcripts, surveys) indicate that impacts of the SPOTing Effective Teaching Workshop series include participant motivation and planned implementation of student-centered teaching practices aligned with research-based best practices.

A standard method for measuring learning is to administer the same assessment before and after instruction. This pre/post-test technique is widely used in education research and has been used in our introductory physics MOOC to measure learning. One potential weakness of this paradigm is that post-test performance gains may result from exposure on the pre-test instead of instruction. This possibility is exacerbated in MOOCs where students receive multiple attempts per item, instant correct/incorrect feedback, and unlimited time until the due date. To find the size of this problem in our recent MOOCs, we split the student population into two groups, each of which received identical post-tests but different subsets of post-test items on their group pre-test. We report a small overall advantage (6.8% � 4.1%) on post-test items due to pre-test exposure. However, this advantage is not robust and is strongly diminished when one obviously anomalous item is removed.

The importance of valuing student ideas in science education stands on firm empirical, theoretical, and moral grounds. However, the reasons for which one might value student ideas are often not explicitly distinguished, even if implicit distinctions are made in the literature. In this paper, I define and distinguish between three ways of valuing student ideas: moral, instrumental, and intellectual, and I suggest implications of these distinctions for teacher education and research.

This work investigates whether the class-average normalized gain score is a useful measure of individual student learning on the Force Concept Inventory among students in the authors calculus-based mechanics course.  The concept of normalized gain is a poor description of the learning of students who enter the authors class with pretest scores less than 20, but a reasonable description of the learning of those with pretest scores of 20 or more.  This pretest threshold prompted a study of the impact of misconceptions on gain.  Among the authors students, the presence of certain key misconceptions is correlated with normalized gain achieved.  Some of these misconceptions appear to be remediated by the course, others are not.  Some of the remediated misconceptions seem to reappear after a retention interval.  A future study will investigate whether early intervention addressing these key misconceptions makes the class-average normalized gain score a better description of individual gains.

Comparative case study analyses are used to investigate a physics lesson sequence in which students used a simple simulation and a set of animations with playback controls to explore aspects of projectile motion. The sequence was conducted within naturalistic high school settings (2 schools) in 11 physics class sections (N=200) where roughly half the sections encountered the simulations in a whole class discussion format and matched sections used them in a small group format in which students controlled playback. Unexpected pre-post results, reported elsewhere, revealed no advantage for the hands-on condition. Analyses using classroom videotapes and student written work also do not show any overall advantage for the small group students for the factors examined. Notably, more than twice as much teacher and student-generated support for recognizing visual features was identified in whole class discussion, and in small groups these episodes appeared to cluster around teacher visits to the groups.

In previous research we have shown that novice physics students distinguish between the concept of a net vector quantity and the concept of a total vector quantity. Introductory physics textbooks variably use the terms net, total or resultant when referring to a vector sum, with some textbooks using these terms interchangeably. In particular, we have shown that students distinguish between the concepts of net force and total force, and the concepts of net momentum and total momentum. Phase two of this research has been to analyse the reasons students give for making these distinctions. Using an approach suggested by Grounded Theory, free responses from 400 freshmen have been analyzed and broad trends of reasoning have been identified. These trends are contrasted with foundational representational schemas posited by the cognitive sciences, such as changing position versus changing state, and interior viewpoint versus exterior viewpoint.

Often in environments where students are collaboratively working on physics problems, students need to manage social conflict alongside grappling with conceptual and epistemological differences. In this poster, we document several outlets that students use as tools for managing social conflict in the context of discussing quantum mechanics phenomenon in clinical focus group settings. These resources include epistemic distancing, humor, playing on tutorial wording and looking ahead to subsequent questions. We present our preliminary analysis of two episodes where students work collaboratively through a tutorial on the Particle in a Box. Each episode highlights a different manner of navigating social tension in the group- through shared epistemic humor in one case, and through a reinterpretation of the question in the other.

Developing physical intuition about quantum mechanics can seem like a departure from our everyday experience of the physical world, but we build new ideas from our existing ones. We examine video data from a focus group doing a tutorial about the particle in a box. In reasoning about the properties of a quantum particle, the students bring in elements of a classical particle ontology, which are evident not only through the students language but through their use of gestures. This is modulated by metacognitive moments in which the group explicitly takes up questions of whether classical intuitions are valid for the quantum system. Through this reflection, the students find some cases in which classical ideas can be usefully applied to quantum physics, and others in which they directly contrast classical and quantum mechanics. Negotiating this boundary is part of the process of building quantum intuitions.

We analyze the experience of students in the Physics Learning Assistant program at Texas State University in terms of the existing theoretical frameworks of community of practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991) and physics identity (Hazari et al., 2010). We find that changes in practice facilitated by the LA program shift LAs sense of community membership and their understanding of what comprises competent physics participation. In interviews and written reflections, LAs report that participation in the LA community changes their ways of learning and of being a student, including shifts toward believing that diversity of ideas and approaches is valuable for learning and that its okay to be wrong and to ask for help. This suggests that the LA experience contributes to shifting students from fixed mindset to growth mindset learning orientation (Dweck, 1986). These findings show that a focus on supporting community membership is useful for effective LA program design.

At Purdue University we are testing a method of interactive engagement in an introductory electricity and magnetism course (that has about 300 students per semester, primarily from the engineering departments).  This course has weekly, fifty minute recitations, where students answer sophisticated problems in small groups of three or four. Starting in the Fall of 2013, at the beginning of roughly half of our recitations, we began introducing these sophisticated problems conceptually with series of 4-6 conceptual, tiered,  iClicker questions. These series are administered by a graduate teaching assistant during the first fifteen minutes. In the remaining thirty-five minutes, the students continue to use these concepts in their small groups to solve the same problems as their peers in recitations without the iClicker introductions. Our goal is understand which style of recitation is most effective for helping our students learn as measured by BEMA gains and course performance.

Undergraduate research experiences have been recognized as a significant contributor to students more central participation in physics.  In this session we will synthesize research on undergraduate research experiences with programmatic perspective of practitioners.  The first half of the session will be short talks. Leaders in scaffolding undergraduate students experiences in research will present overviews of their programs, emphasizing their central design principles. Programs featured here take equity and sense of belonging as central foci for their efforts.  Educational researchers will present key takeaways from their work on investigating students experiences with scientific research.  The second half of the session will be a fishbowl discussion where audience questions will guide a dialogue with our speakers.  Our goals are to give participants the opportunity to learn from both researcher and practitioner perspectives, support generative dialogue and feedback across these perspectives, and work toward design principles for supporting undergraduate research experiences.

While measurement and uncertainty are core elements of the physics enterprise, the way they are incorporated into undergraduate curricula varies greatly. This can range from simply noting significant figures to teaching aspects of the technical formalism. In general, however, research has indicated that students do not appreciate the nature and role of uncertainty. (Unusually for physics two different paradigms are taught (frequentist versus probabilistic) with distinctly different epistemologically interpretations). The Talk&Work session will consist of (a) short Talks summarizing the present situation and (b) inputs from participants in a consultative Workshop format. The overall aim of the session is to identify research questions that need answering in order to meet the challenges with regard to both teaching and practice on the one hand, and student understanding on the other. Participants are asked to bring a summary of current practices with regard to teaching measurement and uncertainty in their own institutions.

PhET simulations are widely used in high school and college physics classes, but only limited research has explored students thinking and learning when interacting with the simulations.  In this raucous structured poster session, we explore students cognition and learning when using PhET simulations, in ways that go beyond documenting conceptual gains from collaborative active learning. By doing so, we hope to bring together creative approaches to studying conceptual, epistemological, and affective aspects of students thinking and learning when using PhET sims, sparking discussions of how to push this research forward.  After a brief introduction to the session, participants will cycle through a subset of the posters.   Then, the Discussant will comment on the posters in provocative ways designed to spur a fruitful discussion during the rest of the session.

Improving student reasoning skills is a goal of many physics courses. Students in majors other than physics are frequently required to take physics not for specific course content, but rather for the problem solving and reasoning skills they are expected to develop. To solve qualitative and quantitative problems in physics, students must be able to chain together a succession of ideas leading to a prediction or inference. A recent report [NRC 2013] describes the promotion of reasoning abilities as a longstanding focus of PER that remains an important area of inquiry. In many cases, however, the assessment of student ability to construct reasoning chains is closely tied to the investigation of students conceptual understanding of a specific topic. This session will present three talks that focus on emerging research methods and theoretical constructs used to investigate student reasoning in a way that transcends the understanding of specific physics content.

Specifically, we will focus on the changes that are occurring in the laboratory instruction due to the NGSS and the revisions of AP courses.

Presenters in the session are high school physics teachers and university faculty.

Research in laboratory contexts is less common than research in classroom contexts, but just as important.  Labs are where students learn vital experimentation, metacognitive, and problem-posing skills; where they try on identities as research scientists, and interact with scientific equipment.  The four projects in this session investigate student learning in laboratory contexts with wildly differing research questions and methodologies.  While some projects take the development of experimentation and bench skills as core to their research, others merely use labs as a context for broader questions of student development.  Each research team will briefly present their project to situate an interactive discussion of methods and goals of research in laboratory settings.

Integration is a complex mathematical idea that has multiple meanings and layers. An in-depth knowledge of definite and indefinite integrals is extremely important to understanding various physics concepts and being able to solve relevant problems. This session includes researchers in both mathematics and physics education who have conducted investigations into the teaching and learning of integrals, primarily definite integrals.  Common themes in the presented work are student understanding of the Riemann sum, the interplay between the mathematics and the physics across multiple contexts, and indeed the role of context itself.

This session will focus on the implementation and assessment of design-based laboratory activities. The speakers will describe their approaches to creating a design-based laboratory experience, and each talk will focus on a different element of the lab, such as student affect, scaffolding of lab skills, assessment and self-assessment, and long-term learning gains. Each of these elements are crucial in creating a productive and positive experience for the student. The talks will be followed by a discussion in which the audience is invited to participate.

We present four activities that are common to professional development activities in the Maine Physical Sciences Partnership (MainePSP) (NSF MSP-0962805). In these activities, we emphasize content knowledge, knowledge of students' ideas, and discussion of the pedagogical strategies which best address student needs while building on student strengths. Our workshop will focus on the teaching and learning of mechanical energy and accelerated motion. In our professional development workshops with teachers, we use student data as anchors for discussion - what do we, as teachers, need to know in order to answer these questions, think about our students' thinking, and respond in the classroom? In this PERC workshop, we use a parallel structure in which the data we discuss were gathered during teacher professional development activities to engage PERC workshop participants in discussions of teacher knowledge of content, students, pedagogy, and the overall structure of MainePSP professional development design

The purpose of this active-participation workshop is to generate community discussion on what students metacognition and epistemological cognition might look like in introductory physics labs, how can we as researchers identify these constructs in video data of students engaged in laboratory activities, implications we can draw about lab-based teaching and learning through such investigation, and implications for current and future work within PER. The video-data in this workshop comes from a single group of 4 students working on a 2-week lab in an introductory physics course for life science majors. During the workshop participants will break into small groups of 6-8 to view and analyze segments of the video. Through moderated discussions within and between the small groups, we hope to further the conversation within PER about the constructs of metacognition and epistemology, specifically as they apply to laboratory settings.

Inherent in the practice of apprentice-model undergraduate research (UR) is a fundamental tension between the educational goals of UR and its basis in faculty scholarship.  This tension leads to challenges for faculty in guiding student researchers in their daily work and in positioning their own UR work within institutionally bifurcated domains of teaching and research.  It also generates a disconnect when it comes to measuring the outcomes of UR.  Traditional outcome measures emphasize students career outcomes and research productivity, while education research has documented students personal and professional learning from UR, including new skills and understandings of disciplinary inquiry, growth in confidence and responsibility, and scientific identity development. Thus far, self-report measures including surveys and interviews have dominated this young body of research.  I will discuss why assessing the outcomes of apprentice-model undergraduate research is inherently difficult, outline the strengths and limitations of the approaches tried to date, and suggest areas for future research.

While the goals for instructional labs have been highly debated, inquiry- and skills-driven labs can lead to significant gains in students' scientific and experimentation abilities. A simple scaffold for introductory labs uses iterative cycles of comparisons to develop students' epistemologies, experimentation behaviours, and critical thinking abilities. By focusing the iterations on improving measurements, students explore the limits of physical models in the real world and engage in the evaluation and refinement of these models. In a controlled research study, students adopted these behaviours and continued to use them even after instruction to do so had been removed.

I believe that there is gap between the results of PER and their classroom implementation. I am concerned about this gap and how to close it. I will talk about what I see are two major challenges to implementing PER most effectively in physics classrooms. (1) Integration: We lack a good model the classroom as a complex dynamical system. (2) Transformation: Transformation or change is difficult and uncomfortable for both students and instructor. In exploring the ideas of integration and transformation, I will try to paint a portrait of my own physics classroom and talk about key components of the physics classroom as a complex system model, including integrating experiments into the classroom setting, the growth of a learning community, and the role of formative assessment and reflection. I will also tell a story of my own personal transformation as an educator and describe the transformative experience that my students undergo. In reflecting on these transformations, I have come to one inescapable conclusion: Real change comes with change in personal orientation for the learner towards learning, and for a teacher towards teaching. The key shift is not in the world, but in the self.

"The Framework for k-12 Science Education" (NRC, 2012),  produced by an NRC  committee which I chaired, delineates a vision of science education as "three dimensional" in that a set of science and engineering practices and a set of cross-cutting concepts are defined and given equal importance to a set of core disciplinary ideas in defining what all students should learn about science in the course of their k-12 schooling.  This vision was developed based on, but extrapolating from, research on learning, chiefly work done with younger students, but also insights extracted from some discipline-based education research at the college level. The assumption was made that the learning needs of students in broad introductory college level courses and those in high school courses are not fundamentally different. Conversely, aspects of this vision can be applied to ask questions about physics education at the college as well as at the high school level. In particular, research questions abound about how to engage students in science and engineering practices (both in laboratory courses and in research experience settings) and the value of doing so. Likewise one can study the value of teaching students to use cross-cutting concepts as lenses to think about questions that may be powerful and productive when confronted with new phenomena to explain or problems to solve. I contend that the lists of these practices and concepts developed for k-12 can inform and guide thinking about science teaching and research on learning at the college level, particularly as one investigates how to design an undergraduate physics education program that better serves the needs of all students, including those not headed for research careers in physics or related sciences.

In an experimental study, we compared community college students engaged in learning the physical relationships of two physical systems, using either PhET simulations or hands-on physical environments.  In both activities, the best predictor of learning was a type of strategy that consisted of experimental manipulations that (1) followed a control of variable strategy (CVS), (2) occurred with a delay between experiments, and (3) targeted particularly difficult relationships that the participants were less familiar with. For one physical system, this strategy was more common in the simulation condition, whereas for the other system it was more common in the hands-on condition. From this, we argue that future research should focus on understanding productive learning strategies and mechanisms supported by different learning environments, not just on which environment is best.

Most previous work on student learning with PhET simulations focuses on classroom environments where students work in groups, with scaffolding from both worksheets and instructors.  By contrast, our study with high school students demonstrates that they can learn from simulations when working independently, both in class and at home, when using appropriately scaffolded worksheets. These results, triangulated with those of Ives et al. (see below), should spark discussion about when and how PhET simulations can support student learning.

Our tutorial for the Gas Properties PhET tried to engage students in repeated cycles of (i) making a prediction using the ideal gas law about what would happen to the pressure of a gas during a given process such as an isothermal compression, (ii) investigating the microscopic mechanism of the physical process using the PhET, and finally (iii) reconciling the mathematical and microscopic stories.  Sometimes, observed interactions among students and between students and the simulation environment mediated by the tutorial worksheet were about Investigating Mechanism, attending to the motion of the molecules, particularly collisions, to describe bulk pressure and temperature changes in the gas.  In other moments, however, when addressing step (ii), observed interactions were about Confirmation, checking that the pressure increased or decreased as they mathematically predicted in step (i) but not attending to the molecular story. Our poster explores these framings of PhET use, our instructional response, and implications for other groups designing PhET-based tutorials.

In this study, we used PhET simulations to teach 100 8th-grade students to use one of two inquiry strategies for discovering relations between variables.  Half of the students were taught to use a deductive approach, the Control of Variables Strategy (CVS), while the other half were taught a more inductive approach we call the General Principle Strategy (GPS).  After eight class sessions, students completed a strategy transfer task, as well as a simulation-based assessment using the Balance Act PhET.  We found that students who used their previously-learned  strategy on the transfer task were more likely to discover the multivariate relation of torque, as measured by performance on the Balance Act.  This research highlights the potential of PhET simulations not only as tools for inquiry instruction, but also as assessments of the inquiry process.

The context for our study is a first-year Physics course. While the course takes place in Canada, all students are international, and this is their first year in an english-speaking institution. Students received a combination of pre-reading assignments and PhET activities to prepare them for learning on the topics of friction and torque. Students worked with the simulations once during the second week of the term and once towards its end. The given activities asked students to explore key concepts in the target domain and reflect on their exploration. Results show that students engaged with the simulations productively, even in a homework setting without instructor support. Furthermore, short interaction with the sim was sufficient to improve students' performance from pre- to post-test. Last, students' attitudes towards exploration remained remarkably stable form the first homework assignment to the second one, a couple of months later.

Core Materials Science and Engineering courses at Cornell contain a laboratory component starting in the sophomore year. This intensifies in junior year, where the laboratory component associated with four core junior year courses is consolidated in a two-semester Junior Lab course. Seniors choose between Senior Thesis or Senior Lab. Within the past few years, the department has begun taking a holistic approach to laboratory curriculum by working towards scaffolding lab skill development across the undergraduate curriculum. This talk will overview these measures and focus on the current effort to transform the Junior Lab course from a set of disconnected labs to a series of activities through which students hone their skills for conducting experiments, thoughtfully analyzing data, performing error analyses, and writing high quality lab reports. Finally, the transformation of Senior Lab into a team-based, authentic research experience will be briefly presented.

We use the theory of Communities of Practice and the concept of Accountable Disciplinary Knowledge to describe how a learning community develops in the context of an upper-division physics laboratory course.   The change in accountable disciplinary knowledge motivates students' enculturation into a community of practice. The enculturation process is facilitated by four specific structural features of the course and supported by a primary instructional choice.  We don't focus on the physics that students learn; rather we focus on how their interactions with each other and the equipment show classroom community development. We support our claims with video-based observations of laboratory classroom interactions and individual, semistructured interviews with students about their laboratory experiences and physics identity.

The new AP Physics 1 and 2 Courses focus on deep, conceptual understanding and inquiry-based learning through labs.  At least 25% of course time should be spent on hands-on laboratory work, and the majority of that should be guided or open inquiry.

This talk will highlight the development, intent and content of this lab manual.

A set of theoretical ideas, referred to broadly as dual process theory, asserts that human cognition relies on two largely independent thinking systems. The first is fast and intuitive, while the second is slow, logically deliberate, and effortful. A common, and particularly puzzling phenomenon has been a focus of an ongoing, collaborative investigation: introductory students often demonstrate competent reasoning on one task, but not on other, closely related tasks. In some cases, students may simply not possess the formal knowledge and skills necessary to arrive at a correct answer. In other cases, however, students may switch their cognitive mode, seeming to abandon the formal knowledge and skills in favor of (perhaps more appealing) intuitive ideas. In order to probe the nature of such inconsistencies, we developed a paired-question methodology that allows us to disentangle reasoning approaches from conceptual understanding and use dual process theory to account for the observed inconsistencies.

From 2002-2012 the CNS Institute for Physics Teachers (CIPT) at Cornell University offered professional development workshops, graduate courses, and free access to a lending library of over 30 different lab activities co-developed by teachers and Cornell University researchers. From the time the CIPT started keeping lending library statistics in 2005 through the end of the funding period in 2012, there were over 60,000 high school student uses of this lending library hardware nationwide. Survey data shows that teachers overwhelming agreed that participation in CIPT programs and use of CIPT labs improved teacher confidence, instructional practices, attitude toward teaching, and lab program quality. Teachers also reported that their students' confidence, learning, attitude, and course enjoyment increased by doing CIPT labs. The CIPT is a replicable model and lending libraries based on CIPT hardware have been established in the US and internationally. Best practices gained from 10 years experience will be shared.

Creating an inquiry-based lab course, where students design their own experiments, can be a challenging task. It requires a delicate balance between difficulty of tasks and students skills and abilities. Here we describe an attempt of using the flow theory[1] for converting traditional lab course into ISLE design labs. We analyze students' feedback and revise the course within the flow theory framework. It appears to be a powerful tool for decreasing frustration often associated with open-ended labs, and for improving students attitude towards the labs. This method allows us to create an environment where students consider designing an experiment as a challenging but exciting activity.

In the summer of 2014, twenty first-generation and/or deaf/hard-of-hearing incoming STEM majors came to RIT to take part in a two-week experience designed to foster reflective, metacognitive practice around the design of experiments to investigate climate change. The entire experience -- small group scientific activities and large group reflective discussions -- was videotaped and analyzed with an emergent coding framework. From the analysis came a number of interesting research questions. On the first full day of the program, the students collaboratively developed a sign for the word ``metacognition'' for which there is not a sign in American Sign Language. Three aspects of the ensuing discussion stood out: (1) how the instructor communicated expectations about decision making; (2) how the instructor promoted student-driven decision making rather than instructor-driven policy; and (3) one student's shifts in decision making behavior. Subsequent days raised the issue of student views on expertise, what traits they attributed to novices and experts, and how they saw themselves transitioning from novice to expert. In this presentation, we discuss the research approach taken to studying a rich laboratory-based environment that contained many elements foreign to the researchers (e.g. deaf/hard-of-hearing culture). We conclude by discussing implications of this research for activity-based physics instruction.

The concepts of differentiation and integration are important tools for solving physics problems. Research in physics education has reported students' lack of ability to transfer their calculus knowledge to physics problem solving.  We conducted group teaching/learning interviews with 13 students to investigate their reasoning in setting up integrals in the context of E&M.  We proposed a conceptual framework by integrating aspects of several theoretical constructs-mathematical resources, conceptual metaphors, and conceptual blending to help us understand student use of calculus concept in physics. The main contributions of this research include (1)  providing evidence for the existence of symbolic forms in students' reasoning about differentials and integrals, (2) identifying conceptual metaphors involved in student reasoning, (3) categorizing the different ways in which students integrate their mathematics and physics knowledge in the context of solving physics integration problems.

We have been running a "Project lab" course for first and second year physics majors for more than 12 years. The main goal of the course is to develop students' science competences and skills in situations that are close to working conditions of physicists. Students work in small groups on open-ended practical problems. Last year we decided to transform the course by adopting scientific abilities self-assessment rubrics[1] as a tool to help students improve specific steps in experimental design. I will describe a research project that we conducted to analyze the effects of this transformation. The research was carried out by pre-service physics teachers as a part of their professional preparation. In my talk I will present the design of the research and discuss the findings.

In an effort to enhance the traditional calculus-based introductory physics course at Princeton University, an Investigative Science Learning Environment[1] (ISLE) inspired lab transformation is underway. In its 2nd year, half of all 16 lab sections performed ISLE-inspired lab activities, while the remaining sections performed traditional lab activities. We strove for a random selection of students. To assess the effectiveness of the design labs, we conducted focus interviews of this year's students and continued interviewing last year's students. The primary questions are i) what are the long-term learning gains of the skills developed in design labs and ii) how is the lab experience of the students dependent on the instructor. We chose a variety of interviewees based on final first-semester grade, gender, and instructor. In this talk, we will describe in more detail the pedagogical approach used in the experimental sections and show results from the interviews.

We review and extend existing frameworks on modeling to develop a new framework that describes model-based reasoning in upper-division physics labs. Constructing and using models are core scientific practices that have gained significant attention within K-12 and higher education. A significant feature of the new framework is that measurement tools (in addition to the physical system being studied) are subjected to the process of modeling. We designed a short laboratory activity and conducted think-aloud interviews with individual students to refine the framework and demonstrate its utility by identifying modeling-based reasoning in the laboratory.  When applied to the think-aloud interviews, the framework captures and differentiates students' model-based reasoning and helps identify areas of future research. A modeling perspective reframes many of the seemingly arbitrary technical details of measurement tools and apparatus as an opportunity for authentic and engaging scientific sense-making.

Using written surveys and individual interviews administered in introductory calculus-based physics and multivariable calculus classes, we studied the extent to which the conceptual understanding of definite integrals affects the understanding of physics concepts that involve definite integrals. We also elicited specific difficulties that students have with definite integrals, particularly with graphical representations, including applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find the integral of a graphed function. One strong focus of this work was how students reasoned about integrals that yield a negative result.  We noticed student success invoking physical context to interpret certain aspects of definite integrals. Furthermore, we found that although students dominantly used area-under-the-curve reasoning, including unprompted invocation of the Riemann sum, when contemplating definite integrals, their reasoning was often not sufficiently deep to help think about negative definite integrals.

Studying student learning in upper-division instructional laboratory settings requires tailoring research methodologies to the unique learning environments characteristic of these courses. As an example, we present our approach to a cross-institutional study of student troubleshooting in junior-level electronics courses. In this study, we conducted think-aloud interviews in which pairs of students were tasked with diagnosing and repairing a malfunctioning circuit. The resulting video data were examined to probe the relationship between students' troubleshooting strategies, metacognitive behaviors, and use of mathematical and conceptual models. In this session, we discuss our research methodology, paying particular attention to both preservation of ecological validity during data collection and application of existing theoretical frameworks to video data analyses. We further describe our application of, and preliminary results from, these methodologies to the specific context of troubleshooting as part of a broader effort to develop new frameworks for understanding problem solving in experimental physics settings.

This presentation will take participants through the introduction of an actual pre-lab session for a mid-year exercise that introduces students to elements of springs while using pre-developed concepts from kinematics, dynamics, and energy storage and transfer. After the introduction, key highlights from the AP Physics 1 and Physics 2 Science Practices will be identified that students would use within the context of such an experience. Connections to future units in oscillatory motion and mechanical waves from the AP Physics 1/2 Curriculum Framework will also be identified.

Science practices are an integral part of learning science. However, mastering such practices is a complicated process for high school students. Unfamiliarity with inquiry-based environment and open-ended problems that do not have one correct solution is often perceived as frustrating for these learners. How do students cope with these challenges and how long does it take them to become comfortable? We implemented ISLE labs that focus on the development of student scientific abilities in a highs school physics course during one academic year and collected data containing the descriptions of designed experiments and students reflections. The data allowed us to answer questions related to the development of science practices including time required for development of specific abilities as well as the level of proficiency. We also investigated the differences in individual and group reports and students' self-assessment and reflections.

One goal of science instruction is, at least implicitly, to improve students' ability to reason logically about physical phenomena, data, and scientific concepts and models. Here I discuss a way of describing the origins of student difficulties with reasoning using the analogy of a contoured terrain or boundary. Specifically, reasoning and decision making is often constrained by strong tendencies to, for example, reply quickly, use the most available information, and make unwitting assumptions and observations aligned with beliefs and experience. I will provide some data on several examples in the context of physics education. In one of the cases studied the results provide tantalizing implications on how to "reshape the contours" and generally improve some reasoning skills. However, in most cases it is not clear if or how one might be able to improve reasoning skills beyond the specific contexts in which the skills are practiced.

To help students develop the scientific abilities desired in the 21st century workplace, four different types of student design tasks--observational, testing, application, and investigation experiments--have been developed and implemented in our calculus-based introductory courses. Students in small groups are engaged in designing and conducting their own experiments to observe some physical phenomena, test a physics principle, build a real-life device, solve a complex problem, or to conduct an open-inquiry investigation. This work was supported in part by NSF and in collaboration with the Physics and Astronomy Education Research Group at Rutgers University. In this talk, examples of the design tasks will be shown and assessment results of students' achievements will be reported.

Students in physics courses often struggle to use or even follow formal reasoning when solving problems or analyzing physical situations. Instead, they tend to rely on "intuition" or temporarily salient thoughts that may be irrelevant to the situation at hand. Understanding what makes those ideas salient and why students make decisions based on them is necessary for improving communication with our students and helping them develop intuition based on proper reasoning. We approach this problem by assuming that students are authentically trying to reason, but they make subtle, nearly unconscious errors. Psychology research in deductive reasoning informs us that novice reasoners err by failing to consider all possibilities afforded by a given situation, either by failing to "see" them or by prematurely striking them down. We discuss how such errors may arise in physical situations and implications for instruction.

Several studies have shown that students are most successful solving definite integral application problems when they are able to see the definite integral as the sum of infinitely small products, or in other words when they understand the underlying structure of Riemann sums. This research involves classroom teaching experiments and clinical interviews with first-semester calculus students where initial instruction on definite integrals is centered on physics applications that highlight the underlying structure of Riemann sums. For example, when students approximate the force of water exerted on a dam, they attend to the underlying structure of force as the product of pressure and area. This research aims to identify strengths and weaknesses of the students as they develop an initial understanding of definite integrals, and how they use this understanding to build more formal ideas, such as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the relationship to area under a curve.

The use of sophisticated math in physical models and problem solving has been identified as a major challenge for students in their intermediate and upper-division courses. Integration is a math tool widely used across physics contexts. It is perhaps the foremost mathematical technique in intermediate level electromagnetism courses. We present semi-quantitative research into students' difficulties with integration in such an electromagnetism course with cohorts of about 50 students. We have investigated what students' views on integration are, before they enter the electromagnetism course, and interpret the results in terms of their concept images of integration. We have found that students primarily see integration as a process of evaluation, and that the majority of students have no conceptual aspect in their concept image of integration. We confirm and quantify earlier results that recognizing dependency on a variable is a strong cue that prompts students to integrate. In addition, various technical difficulties with integration prevent almost all students from getting a completely correct answer to a typical electromagnetism problem involving integration.

Students use of a variety of resources to make sense of integration, and interpreting the definite integral as a sum of infinitesimal products (rooted in the concept of a Riemann sum) is particularly useful in many physical contexts.  This study of beginning and upper-level undergraduate physics students examines some obstacles students encounter when trying to make sense of integration, as well as some discomforts and skepticism some students maintain even after constructing useful conceptions of the integral.  In particular, many students attempt to explain what integration does by trying to interpret the algebraic manipulations and computations involved in finding antiderivatives.  This tendency, perhaps arising from their past experience of making sense of algebraic expressions and equations, suggests a reluctance to use their understanding of "what a Riemann sum does" to interpret "what an integral does."

In a teacher professional development meeting, teachers were asked a question about potential energy and then to discuss why students might give a particular response to it. Working together in a large group, they came up with a rich, nuanced description of student reasoning, touching on multiple ways of thinking about energy, and how these might affect student responses. As PD organizers, we (the authors) had predicted 3 or 4 different explanations of the most common incorrect answer. Teachers came up with several more. Their answers included ideas in the literature (related to time, effort, and work, for example) and ideas not in the literature (such as a wonderfully compelling reverse deficit model of energy). We find that bringing teachers together and sharing student data within a facilitated community lets teachers arrive at surprising insights about how their students think about energy.

The ability to troubleshoot is an important learning outcome for undergraduate physics laboratory courses. To better understand the role of troubleshooting in Electronics laboratory courses, we interviewed 20 Electronics instructors from multiple institution types about their beliefs and teaching practices related to troubleshooting. In these interviews, instructors articulated the idea that "nothing works the first" in multiple contexts pertaining to troubleshooting. We show how this idea informs instructors' perceptions of (1) the importance of developing students' ability to troubleshoot, (2) what it means for students to be proficient troubleshooters, and (3) the need (or lack thereof) to specifically design laboratory activities that engage students in the troubleshooting process. Moreover, we argue that this idea is connected to an experimental physics epistemology: newly built experimental systems do not initially function as expected, i.e., "nothing works the first time." We discuss implications for instruction and assessment of troubleshooting in Electronics courses.

Upper-division physics courses introduce quantitative models that require students to use sophisticated mathematical tools to develop an understanding of them. We have investigated students' in-the-moment math reasoning during physics problem solving, through observations in dyad interviews.  By conducting interviews over a range of students physics experience, we enabled a cross-sectional analysis of how students employ mathematical tools, particularly the decomposition of vectors. In investigating students reasoning underlying their use of those mathematical tools, we have catalogued student difficulties and identified productive approaches for pedagogical purposes. We observed some patterns in students problem solving approaches and difficulties that propagate and/or evolve across levels. For example, introductory students may neglect to consider the sign a vector component while upper-level students are much more thorough in their analysis. However, we observe sign errors in work by both groups, but with different reasoning.

Introductory Physics for the Life Sciences (IPLS) courses are gaining momentum in the physics education community, with the creation of multiple curricula and assessment tools. At Michigan State University, we are designing an integrated lab-lecture introductory physics course that meets the needs of life science students. We approach this curriculum from a design-based research perspective. Our articulated design conjectures focus on (1) connecting the disciplines of physics, biology, and chemistry and (2) building positive relationships for life science students with physics. This presentation will outline the design conjectures that are guiding our first iteration of this course, present example curricular materials for manifesting these conjectures in the classroom, and describe the research plans or examining the validity of the design conjectures.

Communicating about experimental physics is one of the major learning outcomes identified in the AAPT Recommendations for the Undergraduate Physics Laboratory Curriculum.  Traditional laboratory courses often use formal lab reports to educate students about the process of scientific writing, yet this process deprives the writer of an authentic audience for their work and limits opportunities to write in their authentic style.  Our research focuses on a different approach to scientific writing called Letters Home, which requires students to write a letter about their lab activities to a recipient outside of the laboratory course, first to a non-physicist and later to a professional physicist.  Through this process, students practice skills such as gathering, analyzing, and reporting data while expanding their conceptual understanding and experimental skills.  We report on a qualitative analysis of Letters Home written by students enrolled in a Modern Physics laboratory course at Texas Tech University during Fall 2015 and Spring 2016.

Numerous studies, dating back at least as far as Piaget, have used buoyancy to probe students understanding of density.  A few studies have instead probed students understanding of buoyancy in terms of pressure, buoyant force and Archimedes Principle.   In this poster, we present an overview of the latest version of our buoyancy conception taxonomy.  Included conceptions were collected both from prior studies involving subjects having a variety of ages, and from our own interviews and assessments given to college students.

We examined students responses on the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) and their homework within a freshman physics course. The homeworks were designed to elicit detailed responses and sense-making. Students completed the CLASS prior to the start of the course. Student responses on the first two homeworks of the semester were coded for instances of evidence of sense-making, such as checking if an answer is reasonable and providing multiple explanations. We had matched CLASS responses and homeworks for 26 students. 
Our results show that evidence of sense-making on the homework assignments is essentially uncorrelated with percent favorable score on the CLASS and weakly correlated with percent unfavorable score. These results suggest that students formal beliefs about physics, as measured by the CLASS, may be only weakly related to how students engage in solving physics problems and indicate that further study is needed.

Digital tools allow students a playful hands-on inquiry approach to topics that were previously out of experimental reach. For example, we can use an interactive whiteboard in combination with Algodoo software to allow students to throw planets into orbits around the Sun. While students quickly accept the idea of them being able to throw planets into orbit, building an expert-like understanding of the physics of celestial motion requires a coordination of several different viewpoints. Conceptual blending is an analytical framework for interpreting cognitive processes at the intersection of different mental input spaces. The mental spaces we have identified to be relevant in the students' planet-throwing activities include physics formalisms and everyday embodied experiences of interacting with the real world and digital environments.

Teaching science by having students manipulate real astronomical data is a popular trend in astronomy and planetary science education. However, many existing activities simply couple this data with traditional cookbook style verification labs.  As with most topics within science, this instructional technique does not enhance the average students understanding of the phenomena being studied. Here we present a methodology for developing "science by doing" activities that incorporate the latest discoveries in planetary science with up-to-date constructivist pedagogy to teach planetary science concepts. In our methodology, students our first guided to understand, analyze, and plot real raw scientific data; develop and test physical models to understand and interpret that data; finally use their models to make predictions about the topic being studied and test it with real data. We will also present to activities that were developed with this methodology.

With the extensive content requirements for Advanced Placement Science courses, teachers may find it challenging to teach adequate content without compromising time for laboratory data analysis during lessons. The College Board published a series of guided inquiry experiments for AP Chemistry with the goal that students have the opportunity to engage in science practices while learning the necessary content. This study examines how instructional strategies, such as small group presentations and whole-class consensus discussions about these guided inquiry labs, may influence student assessment performance on nationally normed AP Chemistry released questions.

We are currently engaged in a project designed to investigate how active learning methods and undergraduate Learning Assistant (LA) support contribute to the learning gains, achievement, retention, and persistence of students enrolled in introductory and upper-division biology, chemistry, and physics courses. As part of this work, we aim to build quantitative models which will help to parse the relative contribution of different activities and other predictors on student outcomes. Independent predictor variables will exist at both the class level (e.g. nature and amount of active learning employed in the class, nature of LA support, and size of class) and student level (e.g. gender, ethnicity, major, and perceived value of active learning). We will present some preliminary models based on initial data collection and the results will be interpreted and backed with qualitative descriptions of the different observed active learning methods.

Pre-class reading assignmentsbrief, focused reading assignments typically accompanied by a quizhelp prepare students for active classes by providing a first exposure to the terms and concepts to be used during class. We investigate if the use of inquiry-oriented PhET-based activities in conjunction with pre-class reading assignments can improve both the preparation of students for in-class learning and the attitudes of students towards pre-class assignments. Over three course modules covering different topics, students were assigned randomly to complete either a textbook-only pre-class assignment or both a textbook pre-class assignment and a PhET-based activity. The assignments helped prepare students for class, as measured by performance on the pre-class quiz relative to a beginning-of-semester pre-test. We further explore how the inclusion of the PhET-based activity impacts student engagement with and learning of a topic and how this might be mediated by the prior knowledge and prior attitudes of the student.

The AAPT Recommendations for the Undergraduate Physics Laboratory Curriculum developed broad learning goals, in part to focus physics laboratory instruction on critical practices that are best engaged within a laboratory. However, adapting these goals to an institutions curriculum must involve molding these recommendations to local conditions.

A recent study of calculus-based introductory physics students found that they performed significantly better on vector addition and subtraction tasks when the questions were given using the ijk representation instead of an ``arrows-on-a-grid'' representation, and also presented evidence that working knowledge of the ijk format was necessary to correctly perform vector operations in the arrow representation.  A subsequent study found that algebra-based physics students also performed significantly better in the ijk representation than the arrow representation in both one- and two-dimensional problems, even though no explicit ijk instruction was given in the course.  In a follow-up investigation we asked algebra-based physics students to physically interpret their answers, in order to assess if the higher performance on ijk questions indicates physical understanding or is the result of algorithmic ``plug-and-chug'' thinking.  Our findings will be presented along with instructional implications.

Physics education research has for a long time primarily been concerned with helping students to learn physics and to think like a physicist. The results I present here contribute to the emerging subfield where students identity development is analyzed to explore processes of becoming a physicist in a wider sense. Drawing on sociocultural theories and methodologies, and specifically analyzing identity and discourse, I focus on what happens when students with different outlooks on physics encounter advanced physics courses. A discourse analytical framework allows me and my colleagues to inquire into the messages about who one should be as a physicist, communicated to students during courses. This enables a discussion of what physicist identities are made available to physics students. I argue that focusing on these social aspects of physics learning contributes to a better and more inclusive physics education that may also attract a more diverse student body.

Our Mechanics Reasoning Inventory (MRI) is a 21-item instrument specifically designed to assess reasoning skills involving these core topics: Newtons Laws, momentum, mechanical energy, and circular motion. The instrument consists of three classes of problems: whether momentum or energy is conserved in a given situation and why is it conserved, (inspired by Lawsons Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning), application of Newtons 2nd and 3rd law, and decomposing problems into parts (inspired by Van Domelens Problem Decomposition Diagnostic). It has been administered in two MIT courses since 2009. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) identified four factors among the 21 problems which correspond one-to-one with the four physics topics, but not with the question types. Latent class analysis (LCA) based on those four factors identified three latent classes among students students: high, medium and low ability students. These results suggest that topical knowledge is a better predictor of student performance than skill on question type, and points to future directions for improving the instrument.

Over the past few decades many innovations to improve undergraduate STEM education have been developed, only to fizzle out as they struggle to find an audience. Funding agencies have noticed this problem and are putting increased attention on development projects that build in aspects of sustainability after the project funding has ended. In recent years there has been research done within physics and STEM education on developing and disseminating education research projects. But, there is a much longer history and body of literature with common goals in the business literature related to product development and innovation. In this review we discuss product development and launching a product from a business perspective, and how what is known about this process can be directly applied to developing and propagating an education innovation.

Scientific argumentation has been highlighted in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS States, 2013) as one of the key science and engineering practices.  While there have been relatively few studies on student argumentation in undergraduate physics, research (Rebello, 2012) has shown that the use of argumentation prompts can potentially improve not just the argumentation quality, but also the conceptual quality of student responses to written conceptual physics problems.  In this study we extend previous research to look more closely at the impact of construct and evaluate argumentation prompts on conceptual physics problems. The study was conducted in a large enrollment physics class for future elementary teachers at a Midwestern land grant university.  Students were presented with written argumentation tasks on conceptual physics problems.  We examine the kinds of conceptual resources used by students when justified their claim and also when they constructed a rebuttal to a counter argument.

In this study, we seek to explore students discussions during active learning strategies of Peer Instruction and Tutorial-like activities in a SCALE-UP environment. Discussions were recorded in one of the tables of a student-centered learning room in a private Mexican university, and analyzed through a qualitative approach using Toulmins argumentation pattern as framework of reference. We found that the round table functions as a learning community in the SCALE-UP environment, but the dynamics of the table is different while implementing each learning strategy. During Tutorial-like activities, students center their discussions on each small team, while during Peer Instruction students center their discussion in the whole table. These findings provide an insight into the kind of competencies that we mean to develop in our students by engaging them in active learning strategies in student centered learning environments.

For common multiple-choice assessments, we can investigate progress in student understanding by creating simple transition matrices that identify the percentage of students who select each possible pre-/post-test answer combination on each question of the diagnostic exam such as the FCI.  In order to create a transition matrix, we first rank answer choices from worst to best using item response curves.  This allows us to determine changes in understanding of concepts and misconceptions even when students do not get the correct answer on the post-test.  Our work outlines the utility of transition matrices and the availability of a new tool for adoption by high school and college level physics teachers who use a common assessment such as the Force Concept Inventory (FCI).

Ford (2015) argues for viewing scientific practice not as a list of particular skills, but rather, as "sets of regularities of behaviors and social interactions among scientists.  This conceptualization of scientific practices foregrounds how they 1) meaningfully connect to one another, 2) are purposefully employed in their ability to explain nature and 3) prospectively adapt based on critique. While Ford focused on practices in K-12 classrooms, we apply this framework to understand how undergraduate physics majors do or do not make progress toward more central participation in physics research experiences.  Using video from interviews with students and research mentors, and classroom and research-lab observations, we argue that this practice analytical lens affords new insights into how students experience their undergraduate research experiences.   Our analysis traces students' trajectories toward deep engagement with scientific practices through early stages of participation.

Biological and health care majors comprise one of the largest populations of students enrolled in physics courses each year. Because of this, there is a growing interest within the physics and biology communities to restructure the introductory physics courses for life science majors to better support the needs of these students. In this context, computational modeling could prove to be an accessible and compelling tool for exploring biologically and medically relevant phenomena within in the physics course. As a first step, we conducted an exploratory study to help us learn about life-science majors' attitudes towards programming. Our observations suggest that while these students held an apprehension towards programming, they appeared to be more receptive towards spreadsheets, suggesting that this tool could provide an accessible way to scaffold more rigorous computational modeling tasks in the classroom.

Research experience is increasingly considered an important component of science education at the secondary school and undergraduate levels. This poster-talk presents a case study of learning in a unique apprenticeship model in which students are engaged in long-term open-ended research projects in physics that are done at the laboratory in school, and in which the project advisor is a physics teacher supported by a community of teacher-researchers. 
The study documented learning gains such as learning of scientific content and skills, internalization of scientific habits of thought, as well as developing passion, interest and agency with regard to science. It documented features of students engagement, specific features of mentorship and the social infrastructure that fostered this learning. The interaction between a cultural discipline (i.e., physics), the social infrastructure in which the advisor and the students function, the advisor's mentorship style, and the students learning and engagement is discussed.

Supplemental Instruction (SI) is a program developed to target gateway courses with low passing rates. Students in these courses may attend regular sessions in addition to lecture where they are guided through problem solving and learning through group work. Each session is led by an SI leader, a student who has done well in the course. Because student success is the primary program goal, much of the research focuses on outcomes of students who attend the sessions. However, SI leaders also learn and grow significantly as a result of program participation. We have conducted longitudinal interviews with SI leaders in STEM disciplines to examine their experiences in developing communication skills, time management skills and ability to adapt to variations in student and session types. We will present the SI leaders ideas about their development in the context of communities formed and the results of these interactions.

Peer instruction (PI) is an evidence-based strategy for developing students conceptual understanding. In PI, students answer a short concept-question (pre), then discuss it with their peers, and finally answer the same question again (post). Question attributes can affect the degree that students will progress through the discussion. In this correlative study, we investigate how question-specific attributes relate to pre-post gains in correct answer choices. We consider question difficulty, content addressed by the question, and types of understanding needed to answer the question. We draw data from multiple groups of engineering students taking sophomore courses covering conservation principles. Through a web-based interactive platform, questions, student answer choices, and written justifications were collected. Preliminary analysis shows that questions of mid-level difficulty have the most absolute gain, and the easy items show the most normalized gain. Ongoing analysis includes classification of question content and written responses of students to relate those to gains.

Synthesis problems - physics problems which require the application of multiple concepts  can be a source of difficulty for students. In previous studies, we have seen that students struggle with synthesis problems due to bottlenecks beyond just individual concept mastery, namely recognition and joint application of the required concepts. We report on a series of experiments across multiple introductory physics classes which investigated the potential of analogical reasoning as a training tool for such problems.  These analogical reasoning training activities involved varied forms of guided questions and comparisons and different types of worked examples, designed to elicit student comparison of the structure of two similar problems.  We report on the relative effectiveness of the types of comparisons invoked, and the relative effectiveness of these training activities compared to other formats, such as summarization of worked examples.

Students of teacher participants in a program supported by MSP state funds in a high needs urban district are compared to students of teachers in the same district who are not participants. The program emphasizes reasoning and evidentiary thinking. Staff-generated common formative assessments were rated using a rubric. We find no significant difference between students of treatment and control teachers in the pre-assessment, but we do find significant differences in many post-assessments. Limitations of the study will be discussed.

Ongoing development of portable sensor technologies and a growing body of research studying the effectiveness of traditional physics laboratories have brought the form and function of introductory physics laboratories under question. At the University of Illinois, we have piloted a new model of introductory laboratory in our calculus-based mechanics course that implements changes in both the form and function of the laboratory. The new format takes advantage of the flexibility of new sensor technologies, while aiming to challenging students to engage critically and creatively in the scientific process. In this poster, we will describe the components of this new laboratory model, including our use of the Interactive Online Laboratory (IOLab) system. We will also show preliminary results of the effect of this laboratory model on student attitudes and skills.

An increasing number of institutions are adopting a collaborative student-centered studio approach for their introductory physics classes, although there is considerable variation in their deployments and a wide range of success in these different cases.  Through an NSF-funded project, we are investigating the various factors that contribute to positive outcomes in a studio physics classroom.  Using a modified version of the TDOP observational protocol, we observed and coded 13 instructors teaching studio physics classes at two universities. We coded different types of instructor dialogue, class discussion, students group and individual work, and technology used in the classroom. We identified both similarities and differences among the various classes, and here report the percentage of intervals in which certain codes were observed, highlighting the most prevalent codes as well as noting common code combinations. This work will be used to characterize different studio physics classes to determine effective practices.

Problem-solving in the undergraduate curriculum typically occurs in lecture-based courses and emphasizes applying a conceptual and mathematical understanding of key physics principles to given situations. This project expands the notion of problem-solving by characterizing the breadth of problem-solving activities carried out by graduate students in physics-intensive research. In 10 in-depth interviews, PhD students were asked to describe routine, difficult, and important problems they engage in. A grounded theory analysis resulted in a three dimensional framework: context, activity, and feature (that made the problem hard).  Problem contexts usually extended beyond theory and mathematics (e.g., experiments, data analysis, and computation). Important and difficult contexts blended soft and technical skills (e.g., communication and collaboration). Routine problem activities tended to be well-defined (e.g., troubleshooting) while difficult and important ones were more open-ended and had multiple solution paths (e.g., evaluating options). The results can inform curriculum development and PER with an expanded view of problem-solving.

Understanding of physics-related concepts is often quantified through physics problem-solving (PPS) assessments. However, no study has characterized neurobiological processes underlying PPS or skill development via classroom instruction. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to delineate PPS brain networks and probe differences resulting from classroom instruction. 15 students underwent pre- and identical post-instruction PPS fMRI sessions. We assessed brain activity and identified regions more engaged post- relative to pre-instruction (P<0.05). Data revealed consistent fronto-parietal networks contributing to PPS. Moreover, significantly increased post-instruction fMRI activity in posterior medial cortex (PMC), accompanied by improved PPS scores, implicated this regions critical role in skill development. As PMC supports spatial memory and attentional focus [1,2], these novel neurobiological observations provide insight into how education experience may augment brain activity which, in turn, contributes to enhanced PPS skills.

In a scholarship program created to recruit and better prepare secondary physical science teachers, undergraduates majoring in the physical sciences or engineering had an opportunity to participate in an innovative classroom-based field experience.  These field experiences took place in the unique classroom contexts of STEM-focused academies within traditional public K-12 schools.  One of these academies was a project-based engineering academy with an integrated physics, visual arts/design, and engineering curriculum.  The other academy included separate courses in physics and engineering that focused on environmental issues.  In this study, I investigated how undergraduate physics majors participated in the two academy contexts.  I specifically examined their opportunities to observe and participate in high-leverage science teaching practices and how their visions of effective science teaching changed after participating.  I then compared and contrasted these findings across the academy contexts.

Cognitive exam wrappers are tools that focus on using metacognition and reflection skills to motivate students to analyze the factors that contribute to their performance on exams and plan strategies that will strengthen their study habits to improve their exam performance. Cognitive wrappers, utilized here in an introductory physics for the life sciences (IPLS) course, ask students to reflect on the following: 1) the amount of time they invested in preparing for an exam, 2) the root causes of errors made on the exam, 3) study habits that students feel positively impacted their preparation, and 4) strategies that students are willing to implement to improve their performance.   Students also have the opportunity to provide suggestions to the instructor that they think will help improve their learning.  In this work we report on the study habits that students employ to prepare for a physics exam, self-reported root-causes of mistakes on exams, and strategies that students are willing to try to improve their performance. In addition, we will report on the insight the instructor has gained to build a deeper understanding of the student population in this IPLS course.

To compare the Chinese and American students understanding of quantum mechanics, we administered the Quantum Mechanics Survey (QMS) to two hundred students in China and the United States. The results show that the students in the top-ranking American universities outweigh their peers in the top-ranking Chinese universities. However, those in medium-ranking universities in both China and the US have similar performance in QMS.

Past findings show large differences in student ability to use, and reason with, certain data. Many students incorrectly assume there must be dependence between the axes of any graph irrespective of whether the data suggests a relation. Additionally, students have difficulty with variables and their role in the experiment. A majority of the errors are consistent with failure to control variables or illogical reasoning from the data. We developed and tested two different one-hour group activities to improve student understanding. One activity was laboratory based and focused on control of variables and experimentation. The other was recitation based and focused on logical reasoning and data manipulation. Both activities improved student ability to draw conclusions and answer questions about the data in graph or picture form. The relative effectiveness of the activities suggests interesting facts about the importance of logical reasoning vs. control of variables for students working with data.

In 2012, the National Research Council released A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas. This report synthesized the literature on how students learn science into three dimensions that should be blended together in instruction, curriculum, and assessment. This "three-dimensional learning" is the basis for the Next Generation Science Standards and researchers have recently made calls to bring it to higher education as well.  We have developed the Three-Dimensional Learning Assessment Protocol (3D-LAP), which can characterize assessments in introductory science courses as aligning (or not) with scientific practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas. In this poster, I apply the 3D-LAP to some commonly used concept inventories in physics to characterize their alignment with the three dimensions from the Framework. I will explore the potential utility of these concept inventories in the era of the Next Generation Science Standards.

The Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM) is an assessment tool widely used in the Physics Education Research community since its introduction in 2001. Although its been some since its publication, there is no later study in which the test is evaluated as an assessment tool by analyzing the items in detail. This contribution aims to do that by two analyses: (1) a general statistical tests focusing on the items such as difficulty index, discrimination index, and point biserial coefficient; and (2) a detail analysis of the items wordings and images. We use data from 500 undergraduate students who were finishing an introductory calculus-based electricity and magnetism course. From our analyses, and taking some general recommendations for designing multiple choice questions from the literature, we identified some problematic items. We present specific recommendations to improve those items. These analyses and recommendations may be useful for researchers using the test as an assessment tool.

Mindset is a long-standing area of the psychology literature that focuses on students beliefs about whether intelligence can grow and improve. Much of the mindset research involves Likert scale survey items such as, Your intelligence is something about you that you cant change very much. People are often characterized as having either a growth or fixed mindset, however, Dweck recently noted the importance of portraying people as mixtures, in various contexts (Dweck, 2015). Yet, methodologically, it is not possible to examine these mixtures with current broad survey tools. We draw from lessons learned from the science beliefs literature that similarly shifted to studying the context-dependent nature of beliefs through, naturalistic case studies, including open-format interviews (Hammer & Elby, 2002). In this presentation we examine preliminary interview data as a way of moving forward in studying issues of mindset.

Problem-solving strategies physics undergraduates learn should prepare them for real-world contexts as they transition from novices to experts. Yet, graduate students in physics-intensive research face problems that go beyond problem sets they experienced as undergraduates and are solved by different strategies than are typically learned in undergraduate coursework. We conducted semi-structured interviews with ten graduate students to determine problem-solving strategies they found useful in their research. We coded these interviews using emergent and grounded theory approaches. Our findings explore problem-solving strategies (e.g., planning ahead, breaking down problems, evaluating options), contexts (e.g., designing software and troubleshooting equipment), and characteristics of successful problem-solvers (e.g., initiative, persistence, and motivation). Graduate students also relied on representations such as test cases, approximations, and simulations in their problem-solving process. Understanding problem-solving strategies, contexts, and characteristics has implications for how we approach problem-solving in undergraduate physics and physics education research.

We report on connections between student participation in an online course forum and their final grades in an introductory physics class. To do this, we take data on posts and replies over the semester and construct a network representation of the forum community. This network represents the number and density of students' online interactions with each other, and allows us to identify central and peripheral participants in this physics discussion community. Here, we look for significant links between network centrality and final grade as part of a larger investigation of the online community-building tool. These questions are especially relevant for institutions with many commuter and non-traditional students, where asynchronous forum talk is one of the few ways for students to engage with their peers outside of class time.

We examine overall student success in the reformed large introductory physics course for undergraduate bioscience students at UC Davis and find significant reductions in failure rates for all ethnicities as compared to the traditional lecture format of the same course. Using statistical analysis of tens of thousands of student course grades across six years, we find that the UC Davis Collaborative Learning through Active Sense-making in Physics (CLASP) style interactive engagement course is associated with decreased failure rates. In the traditional lecture format course, which the CLASP course replaced, failure rates vary widely between ethnicity groups. While the failure rates in the CLASP course are smaller for all ethnicities, other measures of student outcomes remained unchanged or improved(1).

Students encounter multiple mathematical representations of change in physics courses.  In addition to the inherent complexity of the material, students must navigate mathematical notation that can seem arbitrary and idiosyncratic as well as potentially distinct from conventions used in mathematics coursework.  In this poster we will examine student responses illustrating the challenges of mathematical representations of change, drawn from students in upper-division physics courses in math methods and thermal physics.

We are developing modular multimedia educational material for undergraduate physics for pre-health and life science majors. The modules include videos containing interviews with biomedical experts in conjunction with illustrations, images, and videos of the biomedical devices in clinical use. We are drawing on the expertise of a large network of educators, education researchers, medical practitioners, and physics and biomedical researchers. The multimedia materials enhance the ability of physics faculty without an extensive biomedical background to use our materials even without access to biomedical experts.  The online format of our multimedia modules is portable and allows us to reach a broader community of educators and give more students access to our educational materials. We are conducting a study of students attitudes toward the modules in comparison to the traditional introductory physics courses. The preliminary results of the study will be presented.

Abstract. A North Dakota State University team of faculty is designing, implementing, and evaluating a sustainable campus-wide professional development program to help faculty maximize instructional effectiveness by building expertise in student-centered practices. As part of the program, we are developing a sequence of workshops that is helping create faculty learning communities and provide support for ongoing collaborations. A variety of instruments are being used to assess the effectiveness of our efforts. Pre-post- retrospective surveys are being used to probe how attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived self-efficacy predict faculty intentions to implement active learning pedagogy. Four repeated-measures ANOVAs are determining differences between each construct across the three time points. In addition, linear regression is being used to determine the ability of attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy to predict intentions. Preliminary results will be presented and implications for the design, implementation, and evaluation of professional development programs will be discussed.

The discipline of physics integrates skills in understanding and using the laws of nature. Cross-cutting skills include abstraction, modeling, critical thinking, and communication. Context specific skills include applied mathematics and experimental skills like gathering accurate data. These skills are trans-disciplinary and are useful outside the domain of physics. Standard practices of physics instruction do not intentionally monitor or evaluate these skills. This undermines the relevance and value of physics to the learners.
 
Using a competency-based learning experience model, the skills (competencies) are clearly defined and evaluated. Learners aim to achieve competencies throughout the learning process. The achieved competencies are reported to an external evaluator as artifacts toward competency badges. This approach to learning encourages learners to take ownership of the process. Also, it communicates directly with the learner about the values of a particular learning experience, and, with an external evaluator of the values of a learner.

Learning in the affective domain is an important goal in many undergraduate laboratory courses: e.g., goals that students increase their appreciation of physics as an evidence-based way of understanding the world, and that they increase their self-identity as scientists.  Unfortunately, studies have found that students attitudes about science are difficult to improve.  In our structured quantitative inquiry first-year physics lab course at UBC, we have introduced several course components specifically targeting students beliefs about the nature of science and their self-identification as scientists. We use the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS) to investigate students differing incoming attitudes, and how these attitudes change through the course.  We describe preliminary results for the ~600 students in our course this year, who include a variety of science majors at both honors and non-honors levels.

In this poster, we will discuss adapting an existing web-based computer coaching system to teach skill sets valued by the Next Generation Science Standard (NGSS). Science education at all levels is currently undergoing dramatic changes in the ways students are taught and assessed. As NGSS begins to be implemented nationwide at the K-12 level, the physics education community has begun to explore its implication for introductory physics college courses as well. In particular, it establishes three dimensions of science learning on which to base a curriculum: Scientific practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas. An existing web-based computer coaching system was shown to be effective to improve students problem-solving skills in introductory physics. Here we present some preliminary results in exploring the possibilities of utilizing such computer coaches to teach the three dimensions of science learning

Effective groups are critical for the successful functioning of a student-centered, inquiry-based physics classroom. Research into group intelligence has shown that groups are more successful when group members are more socially sensitive. Yet many of the tests used to measure group performance have not been research-validated. As part of an ongoing project to understand the social factors that make groups more successful, we are developing a set of research-validated tests to measure group effectiveness. In this poster we will present the results of our exploratory work. In particular we are interested in identifying various dimensions of group performance such as efficiency and innovation. And examining whether, and how much, social sensitivity of group members is predictive of performance on these various dimensions. We will also examine whether the tests we develop are predictive of the groups ability to succeed on open-ended physics tasks that are typical of inquiry-based physics classrooms.

There has been an abundance of work done to study students epistemological beliefs in physics lecture classes but much less has been done in the laboratory classes. The introductory physics laboratory courses at Michigan State University are currently undergoing a transformation. One goal of the transformation is to align the students epistemological expectations of how to succeed in a lab with what the faculty want students to get out of the lab experience. This work looks at student attitudes as measured by the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS). We will present analysis of how particular goals of the lab transformation align (or not) with shifts in student attitudes with an emphasis on gender differences.

The self-efficacy subscale of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (Pintrich et al., 1993) was modified to differentiate between the academic and professional environments of physics classes, mathematics classes, science classes, and the students planned profession. The modified instrument was applied to introductory physics students (N=995) at a large eastern land-grant university. Students showed significant differences between their self-efficacy toward physics classes (M=3.7, SD=0.9), other science and mathematics classes (M=4.1, SD=0.7), and their planned profession (M=4.3, SD=0.6) measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Significant differences in male and female students self-efficacy towards physics classes were also identified; these differences were not explained by the students actual performance in the class measured by his of her test average.  These gender differences were also not present in students self-efficacy toward the other environments. Longitudinal analysis indicated that students physics self-efficacy decreased slightly as they matriculated through the two-semester physics sequence.

Research has suggested scaffolds for problem solving.  In a study with 66 undergraduates, we investigated two: drawing a sketch and prompting a problem-solving framework.  Students completed two optics problems during a recitation section in an introductory calculus-based course.  Participants either received a framework, a sketching prompt, both of these, or neither (control).  One problem involved the quadratic formula, requiring students to select one answer and disregard the other as inappropriate.  Many students incorrectly reported both answers; no control students reported only one quadratic solution.  Providing either scaffold helped students to report only one value (p < 0.01).  The second problem asked students to describe a lens; students who received scaffolds were more likely to report focal length instead of simply writing convex lens.  The prompts improved precision and accuracy, providing boundaries on what types of solutions were appropriate.  Characteristic solutions for each condition and implications for pedagogy will be shared.

The Next Generation Science Standards promote a model of energy that includes the ideas that energy is conserved, that energy can be tracked as a flow through a system, that energy transfer occurs through a variety of mechanisms, and other ideas. The NGSS also promotes the practice of developing and using representations of scientific concepts such as energy. We present a rubric for assessing learners energy diagrams for alignment with the NGSS model of energy. We use this rubric to analyze examples of energy diagrams from both learners and textbooks, and to assess a classs increasing facility with NGSS-aligned energy diagrams.

We sought to use students' strong physical intuition for extreme cases to prompt shifts in their problem-solving strategies and frames. In interviews, when students are prompted to examine the extreme cases of a scenario they've been analyzing, they shift towards an epistemic frame of seeking coherence between physical intuition and mathematical formalisms. At the same time, they generalize their conclusions about extreme cases to the general case and recast extreme-case reasoning from an evaluative tool (e.g. Is this answer correct?) to a generative one (e.g. What form could the correct answer possibly take?). This suggests the usefulness of epistemic games such as examining extreme cases, dimensional analysis, and estimation in making math a productive tool for students in introductory physics for life sciences.

Metaphor is a means by which we use our literal physical and social experiences (such as containers and conflicts) to understand other, more abstract experiences (such as knowledge and teaching). Metaphors may shape our perceptions and our behavior without our necessarily noticing them, becoming "metaphors we live by" (Lakoff and Johnson). Influential papers in physics education research use metaphors that have likely shaped thinking in physics education research. We offer several examples.

Most professors at the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley, an Hispanic Serving Institution, perceive pre-med majors to have relatively weak backgrounds in high school physics and math and have little interest in learning physics profoundly.  They also feel many students only want to get high grades to improve their transcripts.  Through implementing various active learning methods in my General Physics I class in Fall 2015, including aligning curriculum with MCAT standards, employing classroom demonstrations, solving problems within various contexts, realizing just-in-time teaching with clickers, and encouraging small-group discussions, we found dramatically improved student attitudes towards learning physics, as measured by the CLASS survey on 19 students in the beginning and the end of the semester.  This pilot study calls for a continuous study on the effect of active learning.   It also directs other STEM educators to conduct similar research to improve quality of education in introductory-level classes.

Students preparing for Physics exams must make decisions on what material to study, how to best prepare, and estimate their preparedness. Previous research has demonstrated that low performing students tend to over predict their learning and preparedness. The use of solution videos is a common intervention aimed at helping students learn Physics content. However the effect of solution videos on student confidence is less well established. We present data where low performing students in an introductory mechanics course completed an intervention involving video solutions. Participants completed a pre-test, viewed animated video solutions, and then completed a post-test. Confidence judgements were made after attempting both pre and post-test problems. Data will show whether or not students are able to learn from viewing video solutions for previously solved problems. We also present data concerning changes in student confidence following the video solution intervention. We discuss the educational implications of our findings.

With the advent of online learning systems, the use of multimedia instruction is becoming ubiquitous.  However, there has not been significant research on the use of multimedia approaches to improve problem solving and transfer of learning.  In this study we investigate three different strategies to improve problem solving and transfer.  Students were placed in three conditions.  In each condition, students first solve an initial task and then completed a computerized a training session based on the condition.  Finally, each student completed a near transfer and a far transfer task. The training session conditions included (a) a cue-only condition (b) a video solution only condition, and (c) a condition that used visual cues followed by video solution. We report on the eye movement patterns in initial task, near transfer task and far transfer task across all three conditions.

The epistemic games framework has been successfully employed in physics education research as a descriptive framework for episodes of physics problem solving. This framework has been employed at a variety of grain sizes, ranging from small, sub-discipline specific games to large, non-discipline-specific games. We elaborate this framework by incorporating elements of activity theory to further explore the role of epistemic game grain size. Rather than view grain size as a limitation or constraint of our analysis, we exploit it and use layers of epistemic games with different grain sizes to examine the reasoning that occurs while a group of middle division physics students plot a 2D vector field.

The students enrolled in the Physics for Life Science course sequence at Mercy College are preparing for futures in medicine or other health fields.  Course learning outcomes are physics competencies framed to be supportive of health profession skills, and the course grade is now largely dependent on achievement of these learning outcomes.  Assignment rubrics aligned to the learning outcomes were used to assess competence.    In an effort to improve student performance, by helping students focus on these competence learning skills and monitor their own progress, assignment self-assessment checklists,  aligned with the assessment rubrics, were required with submission of each major assignment. An analysis was done comparing the competencies displayed in the semester-long student projects this year and the previous two years.

A bias against female physics students is often found throughout college classrooms. We sought to discover if this bias extends to undergraduate students with female Learning Assistants. By using surveys to rate the perceived ability and knowledge of male and female physics LAs, who all have similar credentials, we have found a general trend that female LAs are consistently ranked lower by both male and female students. Additionally, we see that this apparent bias is implicit, as most students explicitly state that the male and female LAs were of equal standing. These preliminary findings have an implication that the gender bias has been extended to the physics LA program at Cal Poly Pomona.

A two-stage collaborative exam is one in which students first complete the exam individually, and then complete a same or similar exam in collaborative groups immediately afterward. One possible marker of an effective group is one in which all members have a high level of participation in the group interactions that lead to the group coming to agreement on their answer for a given question. We analyzed the video of 27 different groups from two different introductory Physics courses and scored each group members level of participation for each question according to a participation rubric. We will report on participation trends based on factors such as the mix of ability levels in the groups and the number of people that answered a given question correctly on their individual exams.

Student engagement is critical to learning, especially in environments designed to encourage student agency.  We investigate student engagement in an afterschool physics program for K-8 students facilitated by university educators from the University of Colorado Boulder. In this program, the K-8 students work with undergraduate and graduate students in small groups on hands-on exploratory physics activities. Using an activity theoretic framework, we analyze video data from the interactions in the small groups during afterschool sessions. Youth participants are the subjects of the activity theory analysis, foregrounding their experiences and objectives for participation. In this paper, we focus on one group of seventh grade girls and the challenges they have to engagement. This work is part of a broader study seeking to foster student engagement in informal settings.

Previous studies about career outcome expectations, or what students hope to achieve in their careers, have revealed strong relationships between outcome expectations and STEM career choice. Drawing from a US national survey with responses from 15,847 students in mandatory College English courses (Outreach Programs and Science Career Intentions, NSF \# 1161052), we examined the relationship between students outcome expectations and physics identity.  It has previously been found that students with certain outcome expectations are more likely to develop a physics identity.  Expanding beyond prior work, we focus on how outcome expectations are related to physics identity for students grouped by: (i) medical and engineering career aspirations, and (ii) female and male self-identification.  The results provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between outcome expectations and physics identity for different students.

Reforming the tutorial sessions has been found to be the most effective and straightforward way to improve learning at the authors home university. To further improve the tutorial sessions, we studied how often students reach an Optimal Learning Moment during them.
At an optimal learning moment a student experiences balanced and high levels of challenge, interest and skill at the same time. These experiences were recorded in situ using an adaptation of Csikszentmihalyis Experience Sampling Method.
The Experience Sampling Method proved to be a practical way to collect data on students feelings during tutorial sessions. We investigate possible correlations between frequency of optimal learning moments, course performance and results from conceptual and attitudinal surveys (MBT, CSEM, CLASS) to find out how worthwhile it is to pursue optimal learning moments.

Introductory-level cosmology is known to be challenging for beginning astronomy students, given its many abstract concepts that can't be directly observed. These concepts provide the foundations for future learning, and so a strong conceptual acuity is important for success as an undergraduate.  This study investigates student understanding of basic concepts from cosmology in three different first- and second-year Astronomy courses at the University of St Andrews.  We have collected and analyzed quantitative (student surveys) and qualitative data (student interviews), and compare results with a previously-published study at a different institution.  The outcomes demonstrate that certain alternative conceptions were more prevalent among students at St Andrews than in the previous study; and that students had particular difficulty interpreting graphical representations of an expanding universe.

Findings are consistent with previously published literature regarding student thinking on coordinate systems. Mark, a senior physics major, despite initially clearly identifying and defining the radial and polar unit vectors on one problem, made inconsistent assertion when asked to apply the concept of position vectors in polar and spherical coordinates.

In this paper, we seek to start a conversation between the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and responsive teaching literatures by exploring the research question, What role(s) does content knowledge play in responsive teaching? We analyze instances that exemplify responsive teaching from classroom discussions of energy, and we find that teachers use content knowledge in responsive moves that connect students ideas to one another and to the discipline. We suggest an approach to teacher education that blends the recommendations of the PCK and responsive teaching literatures, in which teachers develop content knowledge and practice using that knowledge to listen and respond to student thinking.

A feature missing in many physics courses is design work, which would better prepare science and engineering students for future work where design plays a bigger role. This realization has already led to significant changes in K-12 curricula, and we are exploring the role of design problems at a post-secondary level, where incorporating such problems allows for unique opportunities for students to create and adjust models of physics principles. This investigation takes a close look at how groups of students in a section of introductory physics at Michigan State University approach design problems, and how learning is affected. In order to inform and assist instructors and researchers, we have adapted a framework traditionally used in engineering design to characterize the problem-solving steps we observed. Our investigation highlights the utility of design, and offers up some additional questions and possible explanations on the impact of design problems in the physics classroom.

The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) is commonly used to probe student views about physics by comparing student responses to physics expert responses. The CLASS developers found overwhelming agreement among physics experts on most, but not all, of the surveys 42 statements. However, at the introductory student level, previous studies have acknowledged differences by gender, with male students aligning their personal views more similarly to the expert view while female students more accurately identify what experts believe than males. While some prior research has explored the development of physics expertise via CLASS, it has not explored this development separately for men and women. Our work addresses two questions: do male and female experts agree about CLASS items? If so, at what point does the gap close? In the present study, we explore CLASS responses by graduate students at two large, public doctorate-granting institutions through surveys and follow-up interviews.

We have examined the relationship between attendance and exam performance in large enrollment introductory mechanics courses dominated by first-year engineering students. There is a very strong correlation between exam performance and recitation attendance. Recitations engage students in active learning to solve a multipart problems that emphasizes essential concepts. Clicker questions begin and end each recitation. A similar trend is observed for lectures. These correlations are observed for two classes, one very large (1600 students) on a residential campus, and one smaller (150 students) on a commuter campus. We have also examined the nature of this correlation as a function of SAT/ACT scores, gender, and national origin of students.

Despite decades of research using the Force Concept Inventory (FCI), its psychometric properties have been only lightly documented.  Psychometric theory tells us that it is essential for inventory developers to establish the fairness of an instrument for any population for which it is intended.  Many physics courses are strongly gender-imbalanced, which can obscure gender effects when field-testing items for appropriateness. In a preliminary analysis that disaggregated by gender, we found that many items might be discarded from the FCI for falling outside acceptable ranges of item difficulty or discrimination. This result is almost entirely buried when the tests are only run on the overall (male-dominated) sample. Here we extend the analysis to a larger data set and progress to additional psychometric tests, attending to other buried gender effects that may appear.

Evidence from our groups pervious studies indicates that multimedia hints can improve students performance on conceptual physics tasks. This article presents a model of conceptual problem solving with multimedia hints. The model merges problem-solving theory and multimedia learning theory. Greater cognitive load occurs when solvers process linguistic information during problem solving. The model provides a theoretical explanation of the performance data from our problem-solving study. The model generates hypotheses about students visual attention that can be tested with the eye movement data.

Although dimensional analysis is often considered a fundamental skill in physics, surprisingly little research has examined how instructors teach it or expect their students to do it.  Eight faculty from Oregon State University were interviewed to better understand how they think about and teach dimensional analysis. These faculty teach introductory, upper division and graduate courses, and have diverse research backgrounds. Dimensional analysis was identified as either a tool for deriving formulas or answer checking, some preferred to think of the latter mode as unit checking. Students are expected to be able to check units/dimensions at all levels (introductory through graduate) of their physics education. Many faculty commented that, although they may demonstrate dimensional analysis, they do not explicitly discuss strategies for doing it or require students to practice it in course assignments.

Engle et al. (2006, 2012) proposed that transfer is fostered in classrooms that expansively frame students activity: situating students' work in a broader context that transcends the moment-to-moment activity in the classroom. Such expansive framing, it is argued, promotes intercontextuality (IC) which "fosters transfer between the linked learning and transfer contexts. This poster builds on this vein of research. In particular, we examine what kinds of intercontextuality exist in a science class (Atkins & Salter, 2015) that exhibits high measures on one survey of transfer (Pugh, 2011). We argue that IC in which students link the scientific substance of classroom activity with their everyday lives may be particularly rich for fostering TE in particular, and transfer more generally.

Social Network Analysis (SNA) is an important tool in studying classroom dynamics because it can be used to map the social structure of a classrooms interactions and to aid in understanding how students work and study together. This study presents network diagrams, statistics, and centrality measures for several sections of introductory physics. Sections vary in size and structure, from traditional lecture to heavily interactive. Centrality measures were determined from data obtained from a survey style questionnaire in which students were asked to list the names of their study partners within the class. Networks were then analyzed in aggregate and by gender to look for gender effects in network participation. These effects might take the form of different patterns of centrality, or a bias toward student groups self-selecting by gender. Additionally, we look for correlations between centrality measures and success on the Force Concept Inventory (FCI).

Physics teaching assistants (TAs) are often responsible for grading in courses at all levels. Since grading communicates instructors expectations, TAs grading practices play a crucial role in shaping students approaches to problem solving. However, TAs may have a vast array of beliefs about learning and problem solving that may impact how they grade student solutions in introductory and advanced physics courses. To investigate possible discrepancies in TAs beliefs and practices related to grading in courses at different levels, we implemented a sequence of instructional activities in a TA professional development course which asked TAs to grade student solutions of introductory physics and upper-level quantum mechanics problems and explain why, if at all, their grading approaches were different or similar in the two contexts. We find that there are clear differences in these two contexts and a majority of the TAs are significantly more strict in grading in quantum mechanics. Unlike the introductory physics context, in quantum mechanics, they penalize students for not explicating the problem solving process. Differences in TAs grading approaches and reasons for the differences in the two contexts based upon individual interviews, class discussions and written responses will be discussed. The findings of this study have implication for the professional development of TAs.

As our classrooms become more active and collaborative, we need to consider ways that our assessments can take on the same active and collaborative spirit that our classes have.  One way that has come into practice is through the use of group exams.  In exams at Texas State University and East Carolina University, we have utilized a two-phase exam format while allowing students to form their own groups.  We have analyzed self-reported collaboration data which allows us to consider the ways that classroom furniture changes collaboration patterns.  We also analyze multiple patterns of group dynmaics evident in student responses, using some of the measures developed by Beatty as a model for our study.[1]

The Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshop (NFW) does a good job of inspiring participants to try evidence-based teaching practices, but participants often face significant barriers to innovation that cause them to eventually revert to traditional instruction. Faculty Online Learning Communities (FOLCs) are year-long, virtual faculty communities designed to support participants after attending the in-person NFW. FOLCs provides participants with a community of peers and ongoing support to make it more likely that they will overcome barriers to improved teaching. In this presentation, we will analyze one FOLC communication channel: a private online message board. We will discuss how factors like the frequency and type of comments change over time as FOLC participants generate mutual trust and how these discussions support the learning that takes place during the synchronous FOLC meetings.

PER Researchers dont normally satisfy with the End-Of-Chapter problems in physics textbooks, and many types of alternative problems have been introduced in the past decades. Does that change the way traditional textbook authors writing their problems? We used an introductory level physics textbook and analyzed the problems in the Electricity and Magnetism chapters to show how some of the problem features changed from the first edition to the latest edition.

Student learning in undergraduate physics laboratory courses has garnered increased attention within the PER community.  Considerable work has been done to develop curricular materials and pedagogical techniques designed to enhance student learning within laboratory learning environments.  Examples of these transformation efforts include the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE), Modeling Instruction, and integrated lab/lecture environments (e.g., studio physics).  In addition to improving students' understanding of the physics content, lab courses often have an implicit or explicit goal of increasing students' understanding and appreciation of the nature of experimental physics.  We examine students' responses to a laboratory-focused epistemological assessment - the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS) - to determine if courses using transformed curricula or pedagogy result in more expert-like epistemologies relative to courses using traditional guided labs.  Data for this study are drawn from an existing data set of responses to the E-CLASS from multiple courses and institutions.

We report on an analysis of interviews with 137 STEM majors and 40 students who started but dropped a STEM major. Interviewees represent diversity across both race and gender. Students were asked about the level of interactivity in their college science courses and if they preferred a different emphasis. They were also asked if they thought their professors cared about them and their learning. Analysis indicates all demographics prefer more interactivity than they report encountering. Additionally, results indicate retention of women and non-whites may be negatively impacted by a lecture based teaching style. Non-whites and those who dropped a STEM major report the lowest levels of care from their professors.

The Physics Education Group at the University of Washington has been developing tutorials for the junior-level electrodynamics courses.  We have observed that most students enter these courses with a working knowledge of static electric and magnetic fields in simple systems.  However, these students have significant difficulties in transferring this knowledge to other vector fields or to more complex systems.  We first attempted to address these difficulties by having students draw analogies from basic static fields to new vector fields, but this strategy proved to be challenging for many students.  Our subsequent attempt focused on familiarizing students with how the vector derivatives describe the general behavior of vector fields.  This approach proved successful in enabling students to relate their knowledge of general vector fields to the behavior of newly introduced vector fields.

Women and minority students are largely underrepresented in the physical sciences. Here we describe a faculty-, student-, and staff-led group, called a Departmental Action Team (DAT), created to study the recruitment and retention of women and underrepresented minority (URM) students in one physical sciences department. As a result of the DATs work, the department has created a new committee on Representation, Recruitment, and Retention (R-cubed) to improve outreach and support for underrepresented students. We describe how the grassroots efforts of the DAT created a departmental context that was able to leverage campus-level diversity efforts to support meaningful, department-wide discussions and an action plan for improving diversity and equity in the major. As such, we present a case study and model for departmental change in other physical science departments.

We investigate student difficulties with degenerate perturbation theory in quantum mechanics by administering free-response and multiple-choice questions and conducting individual interviews with advanced students. We find that students display many common difficulties related to this topic. To improve student understanding, we use these difficulties as resources and develop a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial (QuILT) along with a pre-test and a post-test using an iterative approach. We will discuss the development and evaluation of the QuILT. We thank the National Science Foundation for support.

This study investigates differences in student responses to in-class and online administrations of the Force Concept Inventory (FCI), Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM), and the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS). Over 700 physics students from 3 courses (12 sections) were instructed to complete the concept inventory relevant to their course, either the FCI or CSEM, and the CLASS. Each student was randomly assigned to take one of the surveys in class and the other survey online using the LA Supported Student Outcomes system. Our analysis examines item level and overall performance differences on the surveys across administration settings. We also examine how testing environments affect participation rates. Student demographic information will also be used to identify potential variations across gender, ethnicity, and racial variables.

Prior research has shown that when life-science students perceive physics problems as providing authentic insight into biological phenomena, they achieve more expert-like ways of knowing in physics. This work discusses the incorporation of biologically-authentic, research-based physics problems into a reformed introductory physics for the life sciences course (IPLS) that is part of the National Experiment in Undergraduate Education (NEXUS/Physics) at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD). The problem set combines an ongoing collaborative research project between labs at UMD and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that examines the biophysical properties of collective cell migration with modern biophysical research methods. More specifically, this work focuses on the determination of cellular biomechanical properties during micropipette aspiration and the application of mathematical modeling in the posterior lateral line primordium migration during the embryonic development of danio rerio.

In order to better understand the impact of lab courses on students' epistemological views, there is a need for a broad view of epistemology that incorporates experiments and evidence into discussions about the structure, methodology, and validity of scientific knowledge. An epistemological framework incorporating these features guided the development of an open-ended survey, which was administered to students in algebra-based introductory physics courses through PhD students in physics. Several emergent themes distinguish introductory and upper-level students.  Regarding students' views about the role of experiments in physics classes, many intro-level students see experiments as supplemental ways to understanding abstract concepts while upper-level students see experiments as opportunities to emphasize the experimental nature of physics and develop scientific abilities. Regarding validity of experimental results, many students justify the validity of results through their agreement with idealized models rather than by repeatability of results or uncertainty justifications.

We investigated the effect of sensorimotor (or embodied) experience on peoples understanding of the concept of center of gravity. Research on the topic of embodied cognition suggests that when sensorimotor brain areas are involved in thinking and reasoning, our conceptual understanding of action-related tasks can improve. To create an or embodied experience, we have developed a set of balancing activities using a meter stick and a set of disks. Participants in the embodied group balanced different systems of objects directly on their hands. Participants in the hands-on group used a fulcrum to balance the systems of objects but did not directly experience the feeling of balancing a system of objects. We discuss the effect of training on post-test accuracy on several specific center of gravity problem examples.

Analyzing structure formation in chemical and biological systems often requires coarse-graining -averaging over short time and length scales of the system to reduce complexity and to obtain physical intuition. We present an instructional sequence intended to introduce this concept to introductory level students. The sequence involves students in constructing and comparing several computational models for diffusion: a deterministic molecular dynamics model - treating all the interacting particles in the many-body system using deterministic mechanical laws; an intermediate Langevin model, where the mechanical laws are applied only to the colloidal particles while the solvent is accounted for by friction and stochastic forces, and a random walk on a lattice model. The sequence was implemented in an experimental program for scientifically oriented excelling 10th grade students at a regional science center. We will present preliminary findings from a study of the evolution in students' perceptions of diffusion and Brownian motion.

A qualitative investigation was conducted of the epistemological resources employed by introductory physics students while solving physics problems in groups. The purpose of this study was to identify the resources employed by introductory physics students and the associated usage patterns of these resources. The epistemological resources were identified using emergent coding and by implementing an operationalized coding scheme from Jones (2015). 26 distinct epistemological resources were identified such as Peer Cognitive Awareness, Mathematical Reasoning, Invoking Authority, and If Its Given It Must Be Used. Students were categorized into groups based on their previous number of mathematics and physics courses completed. Differences between these groups were found in terms of the epistemological resources employed and their usage patterns. Future research will focus on teasing apart the source of the group difference as well as the effect of the different physics problems on student resource usage.

We also show the effects of the lab experience on other aspects of the course, including their ability to learn from analogous solutions.  The information from the reformed lab sections is compared to that from parallel sections taught in a more traditional style.

Michigan State University (MSU) has collected a wide body of data on students for over 10 years allowing for a robust, statistical picture to be painted of how students enter and exit the physics world. This data includes course grade, gender, ethnicity, student major choices, etc. and can help us paint a pathway of every student who has received a physics bachelor's degree at MSU. While this data set contains over 100,000 students who have taken math and physics courses at MSU only 2% of these students have declared a physics major and only 0.5% of students have gone on to graduate with a bachelors in physics. Students who declare physics and then move away from the major perform poorly in introductory courses and are demographically different from the typical physics graduate.

Over the past several years the Physics Education Group at the University of Washington has been working to probe the difficulties students encounter in junior-level electrodynamics courses.� A large proportion of these difficulties involve interpreting mathematical statements about physical systems, such as Maxwells equations; many students fail to recognize that the differential forms of these equations describe the physical nature of the electric and magnetic fields.  In particular, three main categories of difficulties emerged: (1) inappropriate generalization of the divergence and curl; (2) conflation between precise mathematical meaning and loose colloquial descriptions; and (3) failure to identify inconsistencies between students intuition and the physical behavior of a field.

This research is part of a larger study that examines students cognitive structures and reasoning of fundamental quantum mechanics concepts as they engage in a model-based inquiry instruction. In this research, I investigated how undergraduate freshmen level students cognitive understanding about atomic structure and behavior of electrons evolve when they were encouraged pursuing early scientists approach. Individuals constructed their knowledge and developed models to represent their understanding as they share ideas and communicate with others. A model-based framework for this project was adopted along with history and philosophy of science (HPS) in science education to facilitate students to acquire comprehensive understanding as well as develop interest in science learning. With hands on materials and computer-based simulations, students had a chance to imitate Thomson and Rutherford experiments. By doing that, they were also encouraged to think how technological equipment and philosophical and historical background in early nineties affected scientists discoveries.

The effectiveness of scaffolded, research-based instruction in physics has been documented extensively in the literature. However, much less is known about the development of students reasoning skills in these research-based instructional environments. As part of a larger collaborative project, we have been designing and implementing tasks to assess the extent to which introductory physics students are able to logically follow and evaluate hypothetical student reasoning chains in a variety of physics contexts. In some tasks, students are asked to infer the conclusions that would be drawn from different lines of reasoning articulated by hypothetical students. In other tasks, students are asked to rank, according to relative clarity, three different chains of reasoning articulated by hypothetical students. We will describe the development of these tasks and share preliminary results.

The PhET project has begun an initiative to increase the accessibility of its suite of science and mathematics simulations. In this work, we focus on the learning gains of visually impaired students, an undergraduate and recent graduate, after using the simulation, Capacitor Lab: Basics. Comparing pre and post-interview answers to questions about capacitance and circuits, our results show that after using the simulation both learners understood the relationship between plate separation, area, and capacitance. Additionally, while only one learner connected the charged capacitor to the light bulb in the simulation, both answered that the light bulb will be illuminated in post-questions. These learning gains indicate that visually impaired students can master the learning goals of Capacitor Lab: Basics once they can access and perceive of its elements. Findings from this research contribute to understanding how to develop physics education resources capable of supporting diverse students, including students with disabilities.

As part of an ongoing effort to investigate the learning and teaching of bipolar junction transistor circuits (e.g., the common-emitter amplifier) in physics and engineering courses, we have begun to examine student understanding of ac biasing networks.  These biasing networks are critical for signal processing via transistor circuits, yet the coverage of such networks in both courses and texts is typically sparse and frequently secondary to coverage of the amplifier circuits themselves.  In this cross-disciplinary project, we have been examining the extent to which students are able to correctly predict the behavior of the biasing network under both dc and ac conditions.  Specific examples of student work are used to highlight the most prevalent conceptual and reasoning difficulties identified.  Implications for instruction emerging from this investigation will also be discussed.

Large-scale assessment data from Texas Tech University yielded evidence that most students taught traditionally, in large lecture classes with online homework and predominantly multiple choice question exams, did not demonstrate the use of critical thinking skills in formulating their answers when asked questions in a free-response format. Incorrect answers indicated both a lack of conceptual understanding and a failure to apply even lower order thinking skills in problem solving. While correct answers did indicate evidence of at least lower level thinking skills (coded by a rubric based on Blooms taxonomy), incorrect and partially correct answers showed very little evidence of the use of critical thinking skills. Interviews of a subset of these students were consistent with the results of the written responses. The results suggest that in classes that routinely employ assessment instruments that do not explicitly require evidence of thinking skills, students may not develop those skills.

We classified students mental models on conductor and dielectric into four levels: non-model, non-scientific, flawed-scientific, and scientific, varying progressively from na�ve views to scientifically acceptable views. A total of 137 Chinese students from an introductory physics class completed a questionnaire. For the questions on conductor, about 20% of the students were at the non-model level, and almost 15% of the students constructed a non-scientific model and believed that both electrons and protons could move in a conductor. Those with a flawed-scientific model (35%) were unsure about the motion of the particles. Only 30% of the students had a scientific model. For the dielectric questions, over 30% of the students were in the non-model level; about 55% of the students had a non-scientific model and thought that charges could not move in a dielectric. The remaining 10% of the students used a flawed-scientific model. Implications of these outcomes are discussed.

We used Hammer's resources framework to guide the development and assessment of tutorial and homework interventions that refine student thinking about ideal gases. We propose an operational definition of in-the-moment productivity in student conversations and written work (based on the work of Russ et al. and Engle and Conant) to help us identify when students are making progress toward a normative understanding during the reasoning process itself. We found that students used many conceptual resources (some unexpected) and they were able to create mechanistic chains.  This work was a first step to curriculum development on the difficult and biologically important topic of moving fluids by scaffolding the concept of fluidic pressure by comparing the behavior to that of an ideal gas.

In order to further explore the outcomes of faculty professional development, we analyze video-recordings of facultys interactions during the Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshop. We select workshop episodes using our Real-time Professional Development Observation Tool, which allows us to identify instances where faculty members are voicing their ideas and collaborating with each other. We consider how workshop leaders design decisions seem to influence facultys engagement, e.g., how faculty take up workshop instructions, make sense of workshop activities, share and elaborate on their ideas, and justify their arguments. Lastly, we discuss the potential implications of these findings for facultys future teaching practice and for future workshop design.

There was a significant difference from the initial observation period RTOP scores and the fifth observation period RTOP scores. There is evidence for the effectiveness of IMPACT III in reforming teacher practice and improving teacher pedagogical knowledge.

The Maker Movement is gaining increasing attention among educators for the promise it holds for K-12 STEM learning. Similar to project-based learning, the Maker Movement emphasizes the importance of active, authentic learning, but accomplishes this through making; students have the potential to not only be consumers of ideas and objects, but also producers. This paper reports on research on 8th grades students engaged in an integrated science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) learning unit as part of a creative design and engineering course.

The first year's implementation of mastery-style homework in a large introductory physics class showed us that student affect must be considered consciously.  Rather than using the system to their advantage, students often resorted to unproductive behaviors that circumvented learning.  Student frustration was high and ownership of learning was often rejected.  In the homework's second year, our main objective was to reduce frustration by adjusting content and delivery, as well as an activity to address student affect directly.  These changes relieved frustration and we saw student behaviors improve.

Large research universities overwhelmingly use traditional large lecture styles of teaching in introductory physics courses for life science majors. We present the outcomes from an experimental application of a flipped, Cooperative-Problem-Solving teaching model applied to an Introductory Mechanics course of 500 students, with a concurrent interactive lecture model applied to 400 students. The course structure is described in an accompanying poster. Here, we report quantitative comparisons of FCI and CLASS inventories, exam performance, and long-term Physics course performance. In particular, we examine variations in performance on exam question types to assess the relative differences between conceptual understanding, estimation and problem solving skills. While students performed comparably on exams overall (with variations seen primarily in class meeting time), our preliminary results suggest that students who learn in a problem-solving classroom perform significantly better on complex problem solving questions than students who learn in a lecture environment.

One of the most challenging aspect of making the transition from introductory to upper-division physics courses is the process of coordinatizing coordinate independent physical laws for solving problems. The most general form of a physical law is independent of a specific coordinate system. In order to apply these laws to a particular physical situation, these equations must be specified in a coordinate system that is appropriate to the situation. We posed two problems to middle division physics students in individual problem solving interviews that required the students to turn a coordinate independent integral expression into a coordinate dependent equation that can be integrated. We examine the students reasoning while they identified a coordinate system and used this coordinate system to specify geometric relationships, determine limits of integration, and express the direction of vector quantities.

In this project, we developed, implemented, and evaluated a new optics unit in the Modeling Instruction  Electricity and Magnetism (MI-E&M) curriculum.  The MI-E&M course is a studio-style, active learning classroom that focuses on teaching students to use models to explain, predict, describe and understand physics phenomena.  As part of a larger curriculum development project, we designed classroom activities, laboratories, homework, and instructors guides for an optics model, including the topics: properties of light, interference, diffraction, reflection, and refraction.  These materials were implemented in two sections of MI-E&M at Florida International University during the Spring 2016 term. As a preliminary evaluation of the optics materials, we designed a short survey covering the topics taught, which was distributed in both sections of MI-E&M before and after the optics unit.  We present an analysis of this data, including overall learning gains and an item-by-item analysis of student responses.

Multiple-choice assessments are a standard tool for achieving reliable measures of certain aspects of students' conceptual learning in large introductory physics courses. It is harder to develop a multiple-choice assessment for upper-division physics because it involves greater emphasis on assessing students' reasoning in addition to their conceptual knowledge. A coupled-response format employed by the multiple-choice CUE (Colorado Upper-division Electrostatics) diagnostic has achieved great success. We further investigate this new testing format in upper-division electrodynamics content. Our goal is to preserve the insights afforded by the existing open-ended assessment, the CURrENT (Colorado UppeR-division ElectrodyNamics Test), while exploiting the logistical advantages of an objectively gradable instrument. We present the development, scoring, and preliminary analysis of validity and reliability of this multiple-response version of the CURrENT.

For the modern scientific workforce, computation has become indispensible, interrelated to both theory and experiment, as a third approach to solving scientific and engineering problems. By comparison, the integration of computation into undergraduate education has not kept pace. The impact of this situation upon recent graduates with physics bachelor degrees indicates that the failure of curricula to respond to changes in science and engineering practice is becoming problematic. At this point, there has been no systematic, comprehensive assessment of the use of computation, the institutional environment for its integration into courses, and the personnel resources to support such change. Such a survey is now underway and we report the background of its development, and the areas of curricular experiences, resources, and plans that it is designed to assess. We will present some preliminary results that we have accumulated and our comments upon what they tend to indicate.

As classrooms transition from traditional to cooperative learning environments, the effectiveness of the model generates questions. Does this model equally benefit all students? How do non-traditional students gains in conceptual knowledge compare to those of traditional students? Do non-traditional students social differences (such as age, employment status, family life, etc.) affect the amount of learning they do in the course or their tendency to form collaborative ties with other students?
In several sections of introductory calculus-based physics, an online social network survey gathered data about student connections and the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) was utilized as a pre- and post-course diagnostic to determine conceptual gains. The network was plotted and several centrality measures were calculated. The FCI score gains were correlated to each of the centrality values. Non-traditional and traditional student data subsets were compared to determine if any significant differences between the two groups results were present.

Peer evaluation of student work is an important component of many classroom strategies, especially in large-enrollment courses. Georgia Tech has run three semesters of an introductory mechanics course in which students created short video lab reports, then evaluated their peers videos in a scaffolded peer evaluation process. A good peer evaluation process should produce instructor-like final grades, but peer evaluation also affords an opportunity to give students experience with authentic scientific communication practices. We investigate changes in student evaluative behaviors over the course of one semester by comparing student evaluations to expert evaluations of a large set of student-produced videos.

Theories developed by Tinto and Nora identify academic performance, learning gains, and student involvement in learning communities as important facets of student engagement that support student persistence. Collaborative learning environments, such as those employed in the Modeling Instruction (MI) introductory physics course, are considered especially important. Due to the inherently social nature of collaborative learning, we examine student social interactions in the classroom using Network Analysis methods to analyze a survey administered periodically in class. We then calculate centrality, a family of measures that quantify how connected or "central" a particular student is within the classroom social network. Building on previous work indicating relationships between classroom interactions and performance, we investigate this relationship further to better understand how student engagement manifests in the context of a large-scale MI course at Florida International University.

One of teachers greatest tools in the classroom is questioning. It has long been theorized that higher level questioning leads to students developing a better understanding of the material but no one has examined the types of questions asked in physics classrooms in great detail. We used Blooms revised taxonomy to classify the questions asked by a high school physics instructor and surveyed them on what they believe their questioning patterns to be. By analyzing the distribution of question types and the teachers self-perceived questioning patterns we take a first step to better understanding the use of questioning in physics classrooms.

In this paper, we present preliminary work on developing and validating a closed-response assessment of critical thinking skills, which focuses on how students reason with experimental data and test the validity of scientific models. The assessment asks students to reason about the methods, data, and analysis of two hypothetical case studies of students experimentally testing a model of Hookes law. We describe the development and refinement of the cases and questions, and present preliminary results of validation and reliability.

We report on the results of a preliminary study into the correlation between pretest scores and normalized (relative) gain on concept inventories across a number of disciplines.  The issue of these correlations with respect to the Force Concept Inventory has been addressed in the past. It was originally thought not be an issue but further analysis determined the correlation exists and is significant (Coletta 2005).  The correlation seen in the FCI also exists in the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation but is not seen in other concept inventory pretest versus normalized gain results.  We conclude when using FCI or FMCE normalized gain as an evaluation tool the distribution of pretest scores must be taken into account.  It appears that concept inventories in mechanics are different from others but further study is required confirm this and determine why its so.

Students are often asked to construct qualitative reasoning chains during scaffolded, research-based physics instruction.  As part of a multi-institutional effort to investigate and assess the development of student reasoning skills in physics, we have been designing tasks that probe the extent to which students can create and evaluate reasoning chains.  In one task, students are provided with correct reasoning elements (i.e., true statements about the physical situation as well as correct concepts and mathematical relationships) and are asked to assemble them into an argument that they can use to answer a specified physics problem.  The task will be described in detail and preliminary results will be presented.

In the MainePSP*, we have observed students improve the way they analyze thermal energy after instruction. Still, many of them continue to use the idea that coldness transfers. Past researchers have identified that cold is commonly perceived as a separate heat energy. Nevertheless, we have not found specific activities to address this idea. We present the analysis of a collaborative session among K-12 teachers who were trying to analyze how to address coldness in the classroom. During the sessions, teachers got to model the energy in different scenarios, including an object in room temperature interacting with snow. The teachers' models show different approaches to consider the transfer of thermal energy. Engaging teachers in these activities led to additional insights and questions about how to convincingly address students observable experience, that coldness transfers, using a thermal energy model.

Nationally, underserved high school students have little access to quality physics education, resulting in these students being ill prepared to enter STEM careers and STEM programs in college. Project Accelerate serves as a model solution, blending supportive formal structures from a students home school, a private online course in AP Physics 1, and small group recitation and laboratory experiences on campus. 

Boston University has completed one year of piloting this model with four Boston Public Schools (BPS) high schools and three small suburban high schools. The course schedule mirrors a typical yearlong high school AP Physics 1 course, with assessments designed to encourage early success. Students receive midterm progress reports, quarterly grades, and AP credit on their high school transcript. During the 2015-16 academic year, we had an 88% retention rate, 90% recitation attendance, and an average course GPA of 3.3. The program will be expanding in the second year.

In light of recent calls for aligning introductory physics activities with scientific practice (AAPT 2014) as well as a push for the development of a set of recommended practices for life science majors (AAMC-HHMI, 2009), we report on a transformation of a second semester introductory lab course for non-physics majors (life science majors making up the vast majority). The transformed lab was designed with specific course structures to support students in working collaboratively in a group, developing a systematic approach to experimental design, understanding how to utilize different measurement devices, and understanding the uncertainties involved in measurements. We present analysis of small group work that took place in the pilot semester of this transformation highlighting instances where students engaged in these scientific practices in the presence of these supports.

The development of students sense of ownership of their work is recognized by many lab instructors to be an important outcome of lab courses. However, the way ownership manifests, as well as how it is developed, has not been a focus of study within the physics education research community. As a first step toward understanding what ownership looks like in this context, we are studying an upper-division project-based optics course in which ownership is an explicit learning goal. Utilizing data from the Project Ownership Survey, as well as student interviews that focus on challenges and memorable moments, we investigate how their sense of ownership relates to their recollection of the challenges and successes they experienced during the course of the projects. Furthermore, we examine how their described affect, in response to these experiences, relates to their sense of ownership of the project outcome.

Interactive instruction methods have measurable gains in concept learning and retention, but problem-solving skills and development of a scientific mindset are often missing in the large lecture environment that characterizes introductory physics courses at universities.  I describe an implementation of the Cooperative Problem-Solving Model (Heller & Heller 2010) for over 500 students in an Introductory Mechanics course for Life Science Majors at UC San Diego, aimed at improving problem-solving, relevance and student collaboration in learning. I describe our flipped-model approach with 25 hours of video lectures, problem-solving skill development through training worksheets and strategy scaffolds, and bi-weekly team projects combining physical and life science problems. Nine sections of this course were conducted alongside a large lecture "control", all taught by the same instructor. I show comparisons in student performance on exams, FCI and CLASS; and anecdotal evidence indicating increased relevance and collaboration. I also examine how video usage impacted learning.

Current investigations into pedagogical goals of introductory algebra-based physics students at the University of Central Arkansas, by choice of major and by learning orientation towards an in-class metacognitive group problem solving task, seek to determine possible relationships with attitudinal shifts and course performance. Students thus far have been untreated with known group-based learning pedagogies, so as to establish trends of common group habits, and ultimately to properly inform implementation of group-based pedagogies in reaction to these trends. We present initial analysis of group dynamics observed thus far during the problem solving task, in consideration of chosen strategies, determined learning orientations, and attitudinal shifts. In addition, current results will require further information from group dynamics in future research. A proposal for future analysis of more complete audiovisual data, in order to examine evolution of lab group dynamics during a given class period, will be discussed as informed by current results.

Preparing graduate teaching assistants (TAs) and undergraduate learning assistants (LAs) to teach in physics classrooms is a topic of great interest in physics education research. We investigate the use of role-play performances to prepare TAs and LAs to teach students in introductory physics tutorials, labs, and SCALE-UP classes. Each role-play addressed specific pedagogical knowledge and specific disciplinary content. We identify and discuss characteristics that yielded the most successful role-plays. We also find that our role-plays helped TAs and LAs to express their ideas about discursive teaching methods and fostered productive discussions about teaching physics

At California State University San Marcos (CSUSM), in the last five years we have reached more than 10,000 local students and teachers with an outreach program powered by CSUSM undergraduates. CSUSMs area is ethnically diverse with many potential first generation college students. The outreach program is designed to provide local youth with STEM experiences and connections to near-peer mentors who are positive role models, and, more broadly, foster university-community linkages. The undergraduate STEM Ambassadors are highly qualified and ethnically diverse undergraduate science and math majors who lead outreach activities. The program includes sustained efforts such as after school Making programs, and one-shot activities such as classroom demonstrations, STEM Cafes, and campus visits. Program outcomes include increased numbers of students applying and admitted to CSUSM STEM majors (compared to high schools without Ambassadors), and positive impacts on the Ambassadors themselves, including increased technical and leadership skills.

We study how graduate student teaching fellows (TFs) and undergraduate learning assistants (LAs) perceive their roles and responsibilities as educators in undergraduate classrooms.  We present results from a survey of 35 physics TFs and LAs across a range of physics classes, measuring their expectations of their teaching mission with regard to such factors as workload, classroom authority, student interaction time, responsibility for student learning, and helpfulness to students.  We analyze their answers based on the classroom format they have taught in, their length of experience as TFs or LAs, and their self-assessed enthusiasm for teaching. We find that the perceptions TFs and LAs have of their roles in the classroom are similar; however, we find differences when looking at teacher-student interaction.

Many teachers wish to engage students and increase their motivation to study and become independent learners and problem-solvers. Most researched strategies are categorized under "active learning", or they seek to relate the content to the students' lives. Develop curriculum that acts directly to engage students by involving them in deciding what is studied and how. We implement a version of Standards-Based Grading that we call Competency-Based Assessment. We define the competencies and invite students to collaborate in deciding how the competencies are assessed, e.g. exams or projects, and allowing for reassessments. The next step involves students and teacher together defining the competencies. An informal survey from this semester shows indifferent to positive response from students in areas of exam content clarity and ability to retest competencies. Competency-Based Assessment, as part of a larger framework to include the student in decision-making in the classroom, may increase student engagement and meaningful learning.

In this presentation, we focus on students sense-making with a graphical representation commonly used in quantum mechanics textbooks; that of overlaid potential energy and wavefunction plots in the context of quantum well(s) and barriers. Previous research has pointed to a conflation of the energy and wavefunction axes as leading to common student difficulties in understanding phenomena such as tunneling. The existence of this difficulty has influenced QMCS survey items and design choices in several PhET simulations. We add to this research by investigating how students use and interact with this graphical representation while sense-making. Through fine-timescale analysis of video data from clinical interviews with engineering majors in a modern physics course, we document that the inscription can play both communicative and generative roles in the student's reasoning. We report the different ways in which the inscription gets embedded in students reasoning and potential instructional implications.

This poster describes a whole-class whiteboard meeting and analyzes several examples from a college calculus-based introductory physics course taught using modeling instruction.  One section was divided into six groups of 4-5 students each.  Each group created a solution to the same problem on a 2x 3 whiteboard.  The groups then formed a large circle in the center of the classroom with their whiteboards resting against their knees facing in to the rest of the group.  The instructor was outside the circle and interjected rarely.  

Examples are given of conversations where students did and did not overcome sharp disagreements to eventually reach whole-class consensus.  We examine how social positioning contributed to students either successfully examining and resolving different ideas or failing to do so.  That is, how students who hedged their statements seemed to open up the space for discussion, while those who were more direct seemed to close it down.

As part of ongoing research in teaching and learning quantum mechanics, we are investigating student learning of basic introductory quantum concepts in sophomore level Modern Physics courses at Cal Poly Pomona in two different contexts. In one approach, postulates of quantum mechanics are introduced in the context of spatial wave functions of particles in simple potential wells (Position First). The second approach uses a Stern-Gerlach experimental context with discrete bases (Spin First). We will compare students' scores on a subset of Quantum Mechanics Concept Assessment (QMCA) and discuss the implications for instructors of introductory quantum courses.

In our work with Physics graduate students at The Ohio State University, we have uncovered a number of common misunderstandings that persist well into graduate Quantum Mechanics. Here we present an overview of difficulties observed over a two-year period. Observations were made in the contexts of weekly pre-post quizzes, beginning and end of semester pre-post tests, classroom interaction during guided group work, and student interviews. In some cases, we merely verify difficulties already identified by other researchers, but in most cases the student difficulties are new. We discuss the differences in students conceptual understanding and their ability to carry out related calculations, as well as correlations between related misunderstandings.

Students who successfully engage in self-regulated learning, are able to plan their own studying, monitoring their progress and make any necessary adjustments based upon the data and feedback they gather.  In order to promote this type of independent learning, a recent introductory mechanics course was modified such that the homework and tests emphasized the planning, monitoring and adjusting of self-regulated learning.  Students were able to choose many of their own out-of-class learning activities.  Rather than collecting daily or weekly problem set solutions, assignments were mostly progress reports where students reported which activities they had attempted, self-assessment of their progress and plans for their next study session.  Tests included wrappers where students were asked to reflect on their mistakes and plans for improvement.  While many students only engaged superficially the independent aspects of the course, some did demonstrate evidence of self-regulation.  Examples of student work will be presented.

Time dependence is an important, but difficult, concept in quantum mechanics.  The Physics Education Group at the University of Washington has been examining student ability to reason about the period of quantum states.  As part of this investigation, we are probing introductory students understanding of period in the contexts of phasors and circular motion.  We present data of student performance on related problems administered in an introductory mechanics course, an introductory optics course, and a sophomore-level quantum mechanics course.  In addition, we discuss implications of the results for the development of curriculum (Tutorials in Physics: Quantum Mechanics) intended to improve student understanding of time dependence in quantum mechanics.

In addition, we describe and discuss certain patterns in student reasoning that have been identified across the different tasks, contexts, and courses.

In a typical introductory college calculus-based physics course, the makeup of the classroom looks much like the physics community: it includes few women and even fewer underrepresented minorities. This lack of representation is well known, but is rarely an explicit topic of conversation in physics courses. In an introductory physics course at Seattle Pacific University, I facilitated several activities aimed at raising student awareness about the disparity between the demographics of the physics community and the demographics of the general population. Students had the opportunity to discuss and reflect about what it means to do physics, who does it, and why particular groups of people are not equitably represented in the field. In this presentation, I share the sequence of activities used and preliminary findings about the impact of and response to these activities.

A grading approach is presented that is based on progress in a video game.  In a sophomore level electronics course and a junior level electricity and magnetism course, students were invited to retake quizzes to improve their grade.  Mastery was decided democratically at the start of the course and any quiz score above 85% was considered mastery.  The results of a student survey focused on engagement together with the results of conceptual assessments will be presented.

Undergraduate quantum mechanics is typically taught using either a position-first or spins-first instructional paradigm.  Over the last decade, a number of physics education researchers have been investigating student learning and developing research-based curriculum in quantum mechanics.  However, much of this research has been performed in position-first classrooms.  In this work we investigate student learning of time dependence in spins-first classrooms and compare the difficulties observed to those previously reported based on research in position-first contexts.  This knowledge will inform the development and/or the adaptation of materials suitable for spins-first instruction.

In upper division physics courses students are required to work with various coordinate systems. This skill becomes particularly important when learning Electricity and Magnetism, where the most appropriate coordinate system will often depend on the geometry and symmetry of a problem. This study aims to understand how students think about coordinate systems and unit vectors in non-Cartesian coordinate systems.  In this paper we look at student understanding of unit vectors in plane polar coordinates in terms of a resources model [Hammer 2000]. Data were collected in the form of written responses and interviews in upper division physics courses at two universities. After deeper analysis we found that students are activating several resources and using them in ways that can be productive and unproductive.

As part of an effort to examine students understanding of the structure of non-Cartesian coordinate systems and the differential elements associated with these systems when using vector calculus in electricity and magnetism (E&M), students in junior E&M were interviewed in pairs. In one task, students constructed differential length and volume elements for an unconventional spherical coordinate system. Here we describe one aspect of this study, which involves identifying the symbolic forms (Sherin, 2001) students invoked when building or checking these vector expressions. For example, the parts-of-a-whole form was particularly useful to students, allowing them to carve out the specific component structure of the needed vector differential length. Students also used the dependence form to account for dimensionality during construction of each component. Further analysis addresses the role of these symbolic forms in student performance on the task.

In this paper, we investigate the connection between the time students spend on homework and their participation in a course-based social media site on the CourseNetworking platform (CN). We implemented CN in our introductory calculus-based mechanics class. The site was used primarily to facilitate student-student communications, although the instructor also used it on some occasions to distribute information to the class. We also used WebAssign as a homework system, and extracted data on student activities in that system as well. In this paper, we describe a study of the connections among students efforts and outcomes as measured by CN and WebAssign. We find that those students who used CN most also spent more time on the homework, earned higher homework scores, and skipped fewer assignments. This suggests that use of CN is a form of positive engagement with the class, rather than a distraction.

In this study, we seek to explore students misconceptions regarding Newtons third laws force pairs, especially the balanced forces as pairs misconceptions. Three different exams in which there were balanced and unbalanced forces were distributed at random to students of an introductory mechanics course. In each problem, students were asked to draw a free body diagram, identify any force pair and justify their selection. We found that many students had problems with non-trivial free body diagrams. In a simple case (a box in a horizontal surface), half of the students had a correct answer for the force pair; however with a box in an inclined plane, only around a quarter had a correct answer. Most of the mistakes in any of the cases were related to balanced forces. These results were even found in the problem with unbalanced forces in which students forced a balanced pair to answer the question.

Undergraduate engineering students conceptual understanding of the magnetic force exerted on a charged particle was evaluated. An open questionnaire was answered by students at three levels, before, while, and after taking an electricity and magnetism course. The problems presented two situations of a charge near a magnet and asked students to determine whether there was a force exerted on the particle. Different alternate conceptions were found, including charge attribution to the magnet poles and mechanics-related arguments. This was not a linear study; however, participants were engineering students with several majors in the three groups. It was interesting to note that most students had alternate conceptions before taking the course, less of them while taking the course and then back to most of them after taking the course. These results can be seen as trends of how undergraduate engineering students conceptual understanding of the magnetic force may behave in time.

The Mathematization project investigates students use of mathematical tools across the undergraduate physics curriculum. As a part of this project, we examine how upper division Mechanics and Electromagnetism students use mathematical tools in their homework problems. To find the evidences for use of mathematical tools we code students written solutions using the modified version of the ACER framework. Then, using the Social Network Analysis, we compare network patterns across students and problems between both classes as well as generalize network patterns across problem statements. In this poster, we present preliminary findings of this ongoing project to find characteristic patterns in Mechanics and Electromagnetism.

Many geographically related two- and four-year institutions share a large percentage of their students. However, physics- or STEM-specific linkages between the institutions are often weak, despite the benefits of such linkages to the students. We have been engaged in a multi-year effort to strengthen the partnership between the physics and other STEM programs at two regional institutions, California State University, San Marcos and Palomar College, with the goal of creating more coherent STEM pathways for students. Through steps such as building personal relationships among faculty and administrators across campuses, creating coherent academic support services, and establishing formal pathways for students, the partnership improved outcomes for students, including increases in the number of two-year students prepared in STEM domains, number of transfers, and the success of transfers within CSUSM STEM programs. In describing this process, we identify critical elements such as mutual respect, shared goals, aligned institutional missions, and the catalyst of external funding.

We report a study on students approaches to quantitative synthesis problems with varying mathematical complexities. Synthesis problems involve multiple concepts typically taught in different chapters. Mathematical complexity is determined by the number and the type of equations to be concurrently manipulated. Students from a second year calculus-based physics course were randomly assigned to solve one of the three problems varying in mathematical complexity: simple, medium, or complex. Results from written and interview responses revealed four major problem-solving approaches used by the students: trial-and-error, flawed reasoning, knowledgeable, and expert-like approach. Students solving the simple problem used all the four approaches, whereas those solving the other two mainly used the trial-and-error or flawed reasoning approaches. A common phenomenon is that many could identify the appropriate concepts but failed to correctly apply them. Additionally, the students made similar mistakes on all the three problems.

In this study, we evaluate the feasibility and pedagogy of transforming the lab component of an introductory physics course (N=800) such that it can be done entirely at home with common materials, a smartphone, and online support. Student performance in the online labs is compared to students doing similar labs face-to-face in a campus laboratory. The comparison is based on the end-of-term final projects that serve as the main assessment of learning for the lab component of the course. For the final projects, students first come up with a research question and then use the experimental and data analysis techniques learned over the term to attempt to answer the question. Fifteen TAs were used to assess the final projects using a rubric, and no signi?cant performance difference was found between the face-to-face and the online lab format. The main features of the labs and the comparison analysis will be presented.

Researchers disagree over students' use of teleological (goal-directed) explanations in physics (e.g., atoms bond with each other to fill electron shells.). Some view teleology as a misconception held by novices (Keleman, 1999a,b), inferior to experts mechanistic reasoning. Others follow Aristotle in treating these as complementary modes of scientific inquiry (Talanquer, 2007).  Researchers on both sides adhere to a priori commitments, rather than empirical data of learners and scientists explanations.  This poster presents a microgenetic analysis of 20 interviews with both novices and experts as they spontaneously constructed explanations of the behavior of Newtons cradle.  Analysis reveals that (1) experts and novices alike used teleological reasoning, and productively so, as a placeholder (Carey, 2004) for a mechanistic account, and (2) the difference between experts and novices was not in which mode of reasoning they used, but in how explicitly they coordinated both perspectives.  Implications for research and instruction will be discussed.

A social networking website called Course Networking (CN) was used in IUPUIs introductory calculus-based mechanics course, and recorded two semesters of online discussions. We applied text mining to over six thousand posts and replies to identify and analyze student sentiment as it evolves during the semester. Using the Syuzhet package in R, sentiment can be evaluated from one of three sentiment dictionaries, which assign numerical value to words, making it possible to gain emotional valence and to group comments into eight basic emotion types: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust.* Text mining offers an expedient, automated analysis of students online discussions, providing a new window into students thinking and emotional state during a semester-long physics course.

This study focuses on student difficulties in the use of quantum mechanical operators, specifically operators relating to angular momentum, in a senior-level quantum mechanics course.  In order to study these difficulties, we need robust questions that assess the specific conceptual ideas of interest.  In this poster we describe how we have used the ACER framework to develop questions that probe student ability to correctly apply and use operator mathematics in the context of angular momentum.  Student responses to these questions will be analyzed using ACER in the future.  The results of this investigation will inform future curriculum that helps students develop a robust conceptual understanding of the material.

The current study will focus on the impact of a calculus and physics Themed Learning Community (TLC) in order to compare to non-TLC sections on the Force Concept Inventory(FCI), which tests students conceptual understanding of physics. TLCs offer classes with the same major, smaller size, and in conjunction with two or three related classes. For example, students in TLC calculus and TLC physics will have same classmates, and intention of TLC is to create the connection between students. As a result, the normalized FCI gain showed that TLC students performed significantly better than Non-TLC students. Therefore, we will further investigate the reason why the TLC students performed better than Non-TLC students, by categorizing the FCI, comparing with FCI dissertation, and combining the new data that we collected in Fall 2015.

An important focus of the Projects and Practices in Physics (P^3) classroom at Michigan State University is the development of scientific practices. However, it is difficult for students to learn scientific practices, such as communicating scientific information or constructive argumentation, without feedback based on observing students engaging in these practices. As part of the instruction in P^3, students are provided with written feedback that is aimed at guiding the students in the appropriation of scientific practices. Through interviews, we examine student's reflections on their interpretation of the purpose of the feedback and what effect if any it had on their participation. Through observational analysis using video of the P^3 classroom, we also interpret the effect that feedback had on each group. By understanding how students respond to feedback, we can investigate how it aids in the appropriation of scientific practice and the development of an identity as a scientist.

With redesign, traditional verification-based three-hour experiments have been converted into one-hour tutorials led by undergraduate learning assistants and two-hour inquiry-based experiments. In this study, we have investigated the effects of this redesign on success and withdrawal rates, student conceptual learning as measured by Force Concept Inventory (FCI), and student attitudes as measured by Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS). We have found a significant increase in FCI gains with redesigned labs and improvements in CLASS favorable scores for Conceptual Understanding and Sense Making/Effort categories. We also report the result of a characterization of the inquiry level of old and new experiments using a newly developed rubric.

The Sundial Project is a student-centered organization focused on developing student leadership, overcoming underrepresentation in STEM, establishing community, and creating successful scientists. These goals are primarily obtained through a summer bridge program and mentoring program. The summer program promotes a sense of community while engaging students with a strong STEM foundation, built around a central theme. The mentoring program pairs incoming freshman with an upperclassman or graduate student mentor to help them adjust to college life and introduce them to the nature of research. Other Sundial activities include: workshops on equity, diversity and professional development, casual science events, and research conferences. In this poster, we present a description of Sundial activities and outcomes: Freshman involved in Sundial activities reported greater connectivity with their peers and more confidence in their ability to succeed. Further, Sundial membership includes 25% more women and 21% more underrepresented minorities than the general physics population

Teaching assistants (TAs) are often responsible for grading student solutions. Their grading practices can help communicate instructors expectations to students and play a crucial role in shaping students approaches to problem solving and learning. Physics education researchers recommend grading practices that place the burden of proof for showing evidence of understanding on students. However, without guidance and support, TAs may have undesirable beliefs regarding grading and undesirable grading practices. The purpose of this study is to investigate how TAs apply a carefully designed grading rubric that appropriately weights the problem-solving process and whether use of the rubric supports the development of desirable grading practices that place the burden of proof on the student.

An advanced lab course with a significant project component gives students increased responsibility for planning and managing their lab work. However, students can struggle with this transition to open-ended work, particularly if there isnt explicit discussion of expectations.  For the past three years, I have used the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS) to monitor how an advanced lab course with a significant student-driven project impacts student attitudes about experimental work. During that time period, I have increased the use of metacognitive activities that ask students to reflect on their approaches to making decisions and handling problems they encounter in the lab. Here I report on the correlation between the introduction of metacognitive prompts and changes in some responses on the E-CLASS survey, as well as providing a qualitative overview of the students metacognitive reflections.

In this case study we investigate the effectiveness of peer interaction on responses to in-class clicker questions in an upper-level quantum mechanics course. We analyze student performance on clicker questions answered individually and then again after interaction with peers. We also analyze student performance by topic. In general, the performance on the clicker questions improved after interaction with peers following individual clicker responses. We also find evidence of co-construction of knowledge in that students who did not answer the clicker questions individually were able to answer them correctly after discussion with peers. Finally, we discuss the trends in the percentage of students who responded to the clicker questions in the allotted time as the semester progressed.

The ability to flexibly transform between different representations (e.g., from mathematical to graphical representations) of the same concept is a hallmark of expertise. This ability is often lacking in many introductory students as evidenced by the lack of consistency in students representations (i.e., students construct two representations for the same concept in the same situation that are not consistent with one another). In this study, we asked students to construct two representations for the electric field for a situation involving spherical symmetry (charged conducting sphere surrounded by charged conducting spherical shell). This type of problem has been found to result in many students constructing representations that are not consistent with one another. Here, we present findings from individual interviews with students which suggest that students lack of consistency may partly be attributed to the type of knowledge that the graphical and mathematical contexts trigger. Using the epistemic games framework terminology, the two representations students are asked to construct (mathematical vs. graphical) may lead them to play two different epistemic games. We discuss how students epistemological framing may contribute to their lack of representational consistency.

Effectively teaching an Introductory Physics for the Life Sciences (IPLS) course means engaging life science students in a subject matter for which they may not have considerable preexisting interest. While we have found that the inclusion of topical examples of relevance to life-science students can help to engage students whose initial interest in physics is less developed, we have found that the inclusion of biological content is just one of several dimensions supporting student engagement in IPLS. When describing what is salient to them about their IPLS experiences, students are just as quick to cite particular pedagogical structures and supports as they are to cite issues relating directly to content choices. In this poster we begin to unpack this complex interplay of content and pedagogy in fostering student engagement in the IPLS classroom. We also describe the role that explicit messaging around disciplinary coherence may play in students experiences.

Physics tutorials are worksheets that guide students to answer conceptual questions.  Two well-known sets of physics tutorials, the Tutorials in Introductory Physics (TIP) and Open Source Tutorials (OST), are reported to emerge from distinct conceptual change strategies.  For example, TIP is often associated with elicit-confront-resolve, while OST is connected with refining intuitions.  Based on the analysis of interviews with tutorial authors and of the tutorials themselves, we identify a pattern that is common to both sets of tutorials, which we call the revisiting strategy: students are asked to return to a problem they have already examined.  Elicit-confront-resolve and refining intuitions can both be examples of revisiting, suggesting that revisiting is an important and general technique that illuminates the similarity between the two sets of tutorials.

While the flipped classroom is becoming a more popular pedagogical approach, the resources to support our instructors are still coming into fruition.  Additionally, large scale studies of effectiveness are difficult without available infrastructure.  To that end, we have created a website to allow instructors to host their flipped classroom lectures, track students viewing habits, and provide simple content assessment in the form of after-video quizzes.  By having students login through our web portal you gain accountability and information about their viewing habits lost in the old approach of emailing out youtube links.  Furthermore, assessment of content knowledge after the lectures is not possible in youtube, yet is afforded to the instructor with our approach.  Our easy to use and navigate web portal will give instructors the necessary feedback to help evolve and hone their flipped classroom.

Understanding what students students struggle with in introductory physics course material and teaching strategies requires understanding how they think about physics. This is difficult to capture with standardized concept inventories, but can be probed through student metacognition. In this study I analyse weekly metacognition reports by students in a large introductory physics course, taken in both Lecture and Cooperative Problem-Solving formats. Using tools in the Voyant software package, I performed word frequency analysis and examined how key terms changed over the course formats. I also examined the infusion of core physics terms (scientific language) infused over time and teaching condition.

At Swarthmore College, we recently introduced a first-semester Introductory Physics for the Life Sciences (IPLS) course that draws on authentic biological examples relating to kinematics, Newtonian mechanics, and thermodynamics. Because the course is offered only every other year, we are uniquely situated to compare the experiences of those students who take the IPLS course to a similar set of students who take a traditional first-semester introductory physics course that covers the same topics but does not foreground biological connections. In this talk we draw on conceptual and attitudinal survey data, as well as a series of case-study interviews, to describe the conceptual, epistemological, and affective differences that we observe between the two student populations. We identify the features of the IPLS experience that were most salient to students, and suggest how particular course structures may have been especially important in supporting students ability to do well in the IPLS environment.

Universities have rich, large data sets on their students, from placement exams to course registration to demographics, that can be used to improve teaching. Placing educational data in the hands of faculty and allowing them to explore these data has been of interest for many stakeholders in the past few years, with the hopes that faculty will use these data to improve their teaching. Although these data have the potential to be powerful for improving STEM education, data are only as good as their analysis and application.  Using 15 interviews taken at one institution, we studied what compels faculty to seek out university-collected educational data, what they hope to gain from the data and what challenges they face. This poster includes suggestions from the interviewees on how advocates of educational data usage can support faculty usage of these data.

While there are programmatic efforts to support representation of students from underrepresented groups, as well as studies on student identity, little has been done to link the two. We work to develop a framework that combines Hazaris (2009) physics identity work and Nasirs (2011) racialized identity work, in order to understand how identity in physics is impacted by cultural and racial identities. In particular we focus on two dimensions of the combined framework: relational resources (from Nasir), which are the relationships that encourage or discourage participation in the field, and recognition (from Hazari), which is the acknowledgement of being a physics student by oneself or others. We operationalize these concepts by analyzing interviews with physicists at the graduate student level and beyond. In this paper, we demonstrate that the constructs of recognition and relational resources overlap through the careful examination of the experiences of two physicists, one who is a black woman and one who is a white man.  Our findings capture key differences in the role that identity plays in the experiences of physicists of different genders and races.

Teaching and communicating about physics to non-expert audiences in informal settings has been a hallmark of the physics community. Informal programs have a variety of goals and a wide range of content, audiences, facilitators, and medium. However, research is lacking as to what makes individual university informal physics programs successful. In this work, we seek to understand the practices of informal physics programs and how they are situated in their local physics community by examining two large informal physics programs in Colorado. Using management and organizational theory, we analyze interviews with facilitators and document institutional structure and cultural practices within each program. Themes from the analysis are importance of sustained funding, cultural norms of the institution in which the program is embedded, faculty support, and a consistent pool of volunteers. This paper is a pilot for a larger effort to gain a systemic understanding of the impact of informal physics.

Substantial resources are directed toward public engagement by the physics community, but there is still much to understand about physicists initial motivation for involvement, their experiences and their reasons for sustained participation. Previous research (Poliakoff & Webb, 2007) expanded on the theory of planned behavior to identify predictors of scientists intentions to participate in public engagement. We use this theory to investigate the factors that contribute to physics students decisions to participate in informal science programs. We conducted interviews with university students that volunteered in an afterschool physics program for K-8 students. Interviews were analyzed using content analysis. Findings indicate that previous participation in informal activities, attitudes towards engaging with the community, and recognition from peers are common themes in university students initial reasons for involvement. The emergent themes of a sense of community and the enjoyment of sharing physics are related to students persistence in the program.

Relations between work and energy are still a source of teaching-learning problems in the first years of university introductory physics courses since they involve abstract concepts and skills of scientific methodology. Considering the previous studies in the literature, the primary objective of this contribution is to identify and document specific difficulties that students show while thinking and reasoning about the relation between work and energy in isolated systems. Our major research question is: what do students understand about the relations between work and energy?
This research consists in the analysis of answers to a work-energy questionnaire administered to students from introductory physics courses at the University of the Basque Country (Spain) and the Tecnologico de Monterrey (Mexico). In the contribution the results of one of the questions given to students and the general conclusions drawn from their answers will be presented.

Prior physics education studies have established a positive influence in learning when students use research-based strategies (mainly Tutorials) and instructional technologies in physics courses. This contribution studies learning outcomes and behavior when combining a research-based strategy that promotes collecting data, RealTime Physics (RTP), with different instructional technologies: 1) RTF using probes and computers (original version), 2) RTP with probes and a graphing calculator, and 3) RTP with a PhET simulation. Participants in this study were 100 engineering students enrolled in a Mexican private university who are familiar to the use of Tutorials in the physics lab. The experiment was conducted in the circuits unit of an electricity and magnetism course. This is a qualitative study that uses a research-based open-ended test and systematic lab observations. Results show that students learning and behavior are related to the type of instructional technology used in combination with RTP in the lab activities.

Introductory physics students were shown an example problem and asked to recall the solution from memory over a period of weeks, with feedback after each attempt.  The structure of this activity was designed to reward expert practices that benefit the long-term retention of information.  For example, reasoning with a diagram to form the proper equation, rather than just memorizing the equation.  This poster will show data from a class of 15 students, as well as the analysis of four videotaped interviews.

Calc-based and non-Calc-based introductory physics service classes tend to be on the top 10 killer course list (high failure rate courses) at many colleges and universities.  At University of New Mexico, with a minority-majority enrollment, physics faculty developed a parachute class to address this high failure rate and to improve student retention. The parachute class starts mid-semester.  Students not doing well in Physics 1 can switch into the class and the original class is dropped from their records.  The class has two goals: help students maintain their GPA to keep lottery scholarships and help them learns skills and knowledge needed to be successful on their next attempt at Physics 1. Although the class was successful in helping students maintain their GPA; it seemed to do little to reduce the overall failure rate.  Students retaking physics 1 after the parachute class did no better than students who didnt take it.

Student reasoning on physics problems is often context dependent. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that salient distracting features (SDFs) in physics problems may cue students spontaneous reasoning.  This cued reasoning is typically accepted without question, even though it may be unproductive and may preclude the use of relevant knowledge.  Research suggests that strengthening students metacognition may help address these difficulties. The present study employs contrasting cases to develop student metacognitive knowledge (MK) about reflecting on why and how SDFs can influence thinking when answering physics problems.  In this investigation, the learning of the MK was compared under two conditions: (1) synthesizing contrasting cases and (2) processing contrasting cases separately.  Results indicated that synthesizing sets helped students to recognize and apply the MK more effectively than processing sets individually. The findings suggest that the synthesis of contrasting cases may be an effective approach to helping students build relevant MK.

Science practices are an integral part of learning science. Over the course of the 2015-2016 school year, high school physics students, initially unfamiliar with an inquiry-based environment, engaged in ISLE labs that focus on the development of student scientific abilities. Based on the last years investigations, we know that factors such as time, ability type, student grouping, and instructor influence student development of scientific abilities. This year, we are continuing to examine student lab reports in order to better understand the process students go through when they write these reports. The revision history feature of the Google Documents provides insight into development of discourse as well as collaboration amongst students. We also continue to investigate differences in individual and group reports and students self-assessments and reflections of their progress in development of these different abilities.

In Projects and Practices in Physics -- a highly interactive and technologically modern introductory physics classroom with a strong pedagogical foundation -- students are exposed to fundamental physics phenomena with the aid of computation. Within the context of this classroom, we have conducted a phenomenographic investigation of a small cohort of students. This cohort was exposed in-class to a suite of three scaffolded computational physics problems focusing on the fundamental physics phenomenon of force and motion. Over the three week duration of this suite, we invited the cohort to repeated semi-structured interviews, one for each problem, in order to observe their development in approach to computational problems. From an analysis of the students perceived variation in the computational features discerned to be critical, we have observed several qualitatively different categories of student development with modeling motion computationally.

Research suggests that even after physics instruction designed to address specific difficulties, many students struggle to analyze unfamiliar situations. We hypothesize that some students possess the necessary conceptual understanding, but fail to recognize the applicability of their knowledge due to the strong activation of informal reasoning pathways. In order to disentangle students conceptual understanding from their reasoning approaches, we have employed a paired-question methodology in which screening and target questions require the application of the same concepts and skills, but yield inconsistent responses. Our findings align with the dual-process theory of cognition, in which learners often respond based on a first reaction or gut feeling, instead of formal knowledge and skills. In order to probe the robustness of our hypothesis further, we have explored the utility of the Cognitive Reflection Test in gauging the extent to which students reflection abilities impact their performance in physics.

Assignments and assessments that a teacher makes for her students can provide insight into the intellectual demand and expectations of a classroom, as well as the content addressed during instruction. As part of a study to develop assessments of teachers Content Knowledge for the Teaching of Energy, we developed a protocol to assess the intellectual demand of the assignments and assessments that a teacher uses during instruction. In this poster, we will describe our coding scheme, provide contrasting examples of artifacts collected from two teachers during their unit on energy and discuss how similar topics within energy are treated differently in each example. We will then show how the intellectual demand of artifacts as measured by our protocol is related to other measures of practice, such as classroom observation measures, a teachers content knowledge for teaching and student outcomes.

We investigate how students solve partial differential equations and partial derivatives in the context of quantum mechanics. We use the resources framework to investigate students discussion in a group problem solving environment to investigate the fine-grain elements of their problem solving. We analyze an example of students use of separation of variables tool to solve a partial differential equation for a free particle problem in a senior-level quantum mechanics class. We identify a mathematical action called Pulling out as a procedural resource to help students with pulling the time part out of the space part and vice versa, in the course of solving the Schrodingers partial differential equation. We discuss how students use "pulling out" as a procedural step in solving partial differential equations and sense-making.

We investigate the effects of classroom framing on physics students personal epistemologies. Our data are think-aloud transcripts from college students reasoning to predictions of physical situations.  We collected data from two groups, students enrolled in introductory physics (most of whom are science majors) and non-science majors. We coded participant responses for the presence of classroom and intuitive knowledge, noting when one or the other was privileged in reasoning to or justifying a prediction.  Though this is a low n study, our analysis suggests the classroom framing of science students inhibits use of non-classroom or intuitive knowledge even in situations when it is useful.  Using experiential knowledge appears to violate physics students framing of the activity.  This is concerning because it implies the physics students will not connect their experiential understanding of the physical world with the formal physics knowledge being presented in the classroom.

When developers of assessment instruments, such as concept inventories or attitudinal surveys, share an instrument for others to use, they routinely provide some type of evidence of validity when they publish. In turn, the publication provides instructors, researchers, and evaluators with more tools to use for assessment and evaluation. However, there is no single methodology that can be used to generate a perfectly valid assessment instrument. In the end, all assessment instruments have strengths and limitations. The highest quality assessment instruments have been developed and studied for very specific purposes. Yet, others may want to use the instrument for different purposes. Therefore, there is a need to discuss what evidence is needed before using a published instrument. The purpose of this presentation will be to discuss in practical terms how to determine whether an assessment instrument is appropriate for a given use.

The ology in methodology represents the theoretical framework, which is made up of the concepts, assumptions, expectations and theories that guide and support the study method, analysis and conclusions. In other words, it  sets the boundary conditions for appropriate research questions and their epistemological assumptions  Often, these dynamics can seem intimidating, especially where the interface between theory and particular research questions appear to lie outside our domains of familiarity and our immediate feelings of competency. There is another, more friendly, category of theorizing that is particularly pertinent to PER work. In my presentation, I will refer to this category as humble theories. I will discuss how they are constructed with a more localized view in mind, and how they are can be legitimately applicable to a specific content area or context. My discussion will draw on examples from both physics, and from PER areas of research that I have contributed to.

To conclude, I will show how the adoption of a complex system methodology can lead to rich interplays between qualitative and quantitative analysis�to generate a powerful "mixed methods methodological framing.

In the decade after completing my doctoral degree in theoretical nuclear physics, myprofessional interests changed from how elementary particles interacted with nuclei to how students learned physics. To use an optical metaphor, my physics lenses helped me focus on some aspects of how students learned the discipline of physics. Identifying isolated systems, looking for causal mechanisms, and adapting models of interactions are examples of physics approaches that (I brought to/guided) my journey of understanding this new field. Yet my physics lenses left other aspects out of focus and even out of my field of view. To notice and pay attention to these aspects, I needed other lenses.  Examples of these are the philosophy of education with respect to teaching and learning, the history of science with respect to how disciplines advance, and cognitive psychology with respect to the role of students knowledge in learning. I will draw from my own experience in moving from physics into the practice of science education to illustrate the interaction of physics with physics education research.

When I joined the faculty at Purdue, 40 years ago, I became interested in what has become known as discipline-based educational research (DBER). Having received my PhD in chemistry based on studies that used multinuclear FT NMR spectroscopy, it seemed obvious to me to start with quantitative methods based on traditional statistical techniques, which is what everyone seemed to be using at the time. But, as someone who taught medical students at UIUC before moving to Purdue, I soon concluded that all I could get out of statistical methods was evidence of a new disease. It was never going to give me what I wanted, which was a cure. I.e., a way to overcome some of the challenges of teaching and learning chemistry. So about 30 years ago, my group started to focus in qualitative techniques. It soon became apparent that much of our early work was not based on clear, concisely worded research questions. Nor did it build on a strong theoretical framework that would guide the way choices of methodology are made. (To be honest, neither did a lot of other DBER studies at the time!) Fortunately, I was surrounded by bright graduate students who were willing to help guide me in my search for a better way to approach such interesting questions as whether our model of what successful students did when working on quantitative problems they encountered in the introductory chemistry course would have any resemblance to the model of successful problem solving both undergraduate and graduate students used when working on non-quantitative problems such as predicting the product of a chemical reaction or deducing the structure of a compound from FT NMR and FT IR spectra. My goal in this paper is to provide a glance at some of what we learned as a result of bringing qualitative research into the CER community. And to explain why we eventually published a book with the title: Theoretical Frameworks for Research in Chemistry/Science Education.

This poster symposium will highlight multiple quantitative methodologies that can allow physics education researchers to expand the type of research questions we can address by exploring the alignment between research design, research questions, data analysis and knowledge claims. As our guiding theoretical frameworks push us to examine our participants in richer detail, we must simultaneously adapt our research design and analysis methods to account for these multi-faceted data. Presenters in this session will highlight four distinct methodologies, requiring advanced quantitative analysis techniques, that allowed them to develop detailed quantitative descriptions of students learning and attitudes. By comparing across presenters, participants will be able to trace how differences in each researchers guiding theoretical framework led to specific decisions about research design and analysis, allowing them to answer different types of research questions.

As a field, Physics Education Research (PER) has its place in the national initiatives to address the underrepresentation of minority and female students in STEM fields. Questions of how to recruit, retains and have underrepresented students persist in STEM fields leads researchers to explore much more than student performance, into exploring who our students are and how they participate in the sciences. Theories of identity help researchers interpret persistence trends and reasons that correlate with group underrepresentation in the sciences.  In this invited poster symposia we discuss some design challenges such as choosing a theoretical framework of identity that informs the research question and analysis of data. We will also discuss how a design choice reflects the researchers own beliefs, biases, and perceptions of knowledge and education.
The poster symposia showcase identity theories within communities of practice, physics identity, critical race theory, intersectionality, and qualitative/quantitative data collection within these frameworks.

This poster symposium showcases recent applications of network analysis in physics and science education research. Approaches include a focus on individual students (ego networks), a time-evolving range of interaction types for an entire class (multiplex networks), and combinations with other tools such as text mining and discourse analysis. Social network analysis can complement qualitative methods in exploring the rich complexity of student participation, and is especially valuable for capturing the many student-student interactions that are an integral part of active learning environments. Other applications of network analysis, rather than approximating a social landscape, uncover hidden connections and themes in dense bodies of text such as interview transcripts. The research in this session highlights a variety of ways that the network data perspective extends the existing methodological toolbox of physics education research.

Data from the FMCE support findings that students' understanding of graphs impacts their abilities to express their understanding of the relationships between and among forces and various quantities of motion. We approach the current study with an assumption that measurements of student understanding of a particular topic depend not only on the student but also on the instrument used to make the measurement. Multiple measurements are needed to build a more complete picture of what the student actually "knows." We compare individual student responses to 12 specific questions on the FMCE from three question clusters. Each cluster provides students with four identical descriptions of object velocities. In one cluster students choose a description of an accompanying force, in the others students choose a graph of force or acceleration vs. time. We use Cohen's w to report the correlation between the clusters and consistency plots to show the impact of instruction.

Network analysis is aligned with a theoretical framework that values relational questions and connection between quantities. One of the problems of using frequentist statistics in education is that most statistical analyses (such as t-tests and analysis of variance) require normally distributed data set, with observations that are independent of one another; however, when studying students in a classroom, these assumptions are often violated.  Students interact with each other, instructors, and course material, allowing ideas to be transferred in a variety of ways.  Learning is embedded in these interactions and can be an exciting area to research but fundamentally requires a research design that captures relational data. This poster will present an example from our work on students' use of representations to demonstrate the types of questions that network analysis can answer, highlight a variety of the analyses that can be run with relational data, and address some of the challenges we faced in using this methodology.

We report on connections between student participation in an online course forum and their grades in an introductory physics class. Discussions started before the semester, ended after finals, and continued well beyond the level incentivized by extra credit. We collect all posts and replies and construct a bipartite network of actors (students) and events (threads) in the forum. The actor projection of this two-mode network is a weighted representation of students' mutual participation in discussion threads, and shows whether they are central or peripheral participants in the semester-long discussion community. We look for significant links between network centrality and final grades, as part of a larger investigation of the CourseNetworking software as an online community-building tool. These questions are especially relevant for institutions with many commuter and non-traditional students, where asynchronous forum talk is a key way for students to engage with their peers outside of class time.

The physics department at Texas State University has implemented a Learning Assistant (LA) program in our introductory course sequences. We are interested in how participation in the LA program influences LAs' identity both as physics students and as physics teachers; in particular, how being part of the LA community changes participants' self-concepts and their day-to-day practice. Our analytic lens is a blended theoretical framework informed by the physics identity framework developed by Hazari et al., which relies on self-report of experiences and self-perception; and Lave and Wenger's theory of Communities of Practice, which focuses on the ways in which identity is enacted and negotiated. We describe the two theories and build a correspondence between factors in the physics identity framework and community of practice theory. This blended theory is used to analyze video of LA interviews and written artifacts for evidence of shifts in LA identity.

We present the analysis of ego networks derived from a survey of upper division physics students. Analysis of ego networks are somewhat different than network analyses that are becoming more common in PER. Ego networks focus on the connections that center on one person (the ego). The ego networks in this poster come from a survey that is part of an overall project focused on understanding student retention and persistence. The theory underlying this work is that social and academic integration are essential components to supporting students continued enrollment and ultimately graduation. This work uses network analysis as a way to investigate the role of social and academic interactions in retention and persistence decisions. We focus on student interactions with peers, on mentoring interactions with physics department faculty, and on engagement in physics groups and how they influence persistence. Our results, which are preliminary, will help frame the ongoing research project and identify ways in which departments can support students.

Traditionally, education studies that explicitly or implicitly examine differences between normative and non-normative groups have based their analysis by choosing a particular pre-defined normative group (e.g. majority race students), and then draw comparisons against that group. The researcher thus imposes a priori definitions of both what is important and how to group students for comparisons. This can put the research at odds with an intersectional approach to understanding individuals. A quantitative topological data analysis (TDA) allows us to answer research questions in a way that respects the intersectional diversity of the students. Using only quantitative affective data, including a spectrum of attitudes, beliefs and identity measures, but not student demographic information, we allow student responses to form emergent attitudinal profiles that define the normative characteristics of our sample of introductory engineering students.

Individual students bring their own motivations and self-regulated study strategies to the classroom. When interested in characterizing students, one can turn to the Profile Approach. At the core of this approach is a theoretical framework that considers the interactions of different motivational and strategic self-regulatory constructs and describes the various, distinct patterns that exist across these constructs as Learning Profiles. The Profile Approach relies on individuals' characteristics; thus, accompanying research designs must incorporate collecting student-level data on various motivational and strategic self-regulatory constructs. Also, analyses must consider patterns across these constructs. Cluster analysis is such a technique, allowing identification of coherent groups (Learning Profiles) based on patterns in the data. Resulting Profiles are useful for exploring hypotheses about student characteristics, guiding instructors to better understand their students, and follow-up statistical analyses. I present--from start to finish--applying the Profile Approach to identify Learning Profiles among algebra-based, studio-mode physics students.

We use a combination of network analysis (NA), text-mining (TM) techniques, and thematic discourse analysis (TDA) to characterise and compare student discussions about sustainable development. Three student groups at three different times were analysed. The analysis entails an iterative design where NA, TM, and TDA continuously inform each other to produce a rich and coherent picture of the discussions. The output of such an analysis is a set of maps of these discussions, which have both qualitative and quantitative uses. Qualitatively, the maps show how thematic patterns in the discussions are related for each group, and we can see how discourses differ between groups as well as over time. Quantitatively, we use network motif analysis, entropy based measures, and degree distributions to distinguish between discussions.

Network analysis has previously been employed to show that centrality in student interaction networks can predict future grades. However, previous analyses have only been employed on isolated categories of student interactions which have been summed over time. In this study we use multiplex (layered) networks to relax these constraints. Within a week, we now allow bidirectional links between the same student as represented in two different layers, for example a layer representing problem solving interactions and another representing conceptual discussion, to model how these layers may interact. Likewise, we allow links from a student as represented in a network at time, t, and the same student in the network for time, t+1. The nature of links between network layers is different from the original links and thus need a theoretically based model. These models may yield insights into the interplay between categories of interaction into the significance of time development.

In this poster, we will unpack the claim that different ways of generalizing and selecting in PER are tied to different assumptions about knowledge, our social world, and our reasons for knowing it.  In particular, we will compare and contrast the assumptions made by two different research paradigms: what we call case-oriented PER  which seeks to refine and develop theory by linking that theory to cases  and what we call recurrence-oriented PER  which seeks to inform instructional predictions by discerning reproducible, representative patterns and relationships.  We will discuss how the different assumptions instantiated within these two paradigms can help us make sense of differences in generalization and selection practices in PER.

When we look at underrepresented groups in science, Black women have particular experiences in the field. In this presentation we bring the perspectives of Black women in Physics in regards to the construction of scientific identity. Stemming from notions of identity as performance and using a Critical Race Theory (CRT) framework, we look at scientists' life trajectories to talk about how they develop their identity as physicists. Specifically, we will focus on the methods used to both unveil these narratives and analyze them. First, we will address interviewing as a method to collect data in Physics Education Research (PER). Then, we discuss the use of the qualitative analysis software Atlas.ti to help searching for emergent themes when dealing with interview transcripts as data. In addition, we talk about how qualitative analysis software can be an aid in reducing bias in qualitative research, which is rich and dense with information. With this work, we hope to bring CRT perspectives to the PER community and contribute with discussions around underrepresented groups in Physics.

Solving physics problems in university physics education using a numerical approach requires knowledge and skills in several domains, for example, physics, mathematics, programming, and modeling. In this study students' mental models are monitored using interviews at several occasions during an assignment in computational physics. The interview data was analysed using a network analysis approach. Interview transcripts were coded according to the context dependent concepts that were used to define the particular context and situation of this assignment. The adjacency of concepts in the transcripts was assumed to reflect the associations between them made by students, and thus representing students' mental models of the problem solving situation at the time of the interview. For each student a network was built where the concepts were nodes and their adjacency formed the links between them. The changes in students' mental models between the interview occasions gave important information about what the students were focusing on at different stages of the solution process. What students focused on at the different interview occasions was assumed to be an indication of what they believed was useful in solving the task. The visualization of the mental models showed that at the beginning students were concerned about how to deal with writing the Matlab code that was needed to model the problem. As students got more comfortable with the coding process, the physics needed to assure that their simulation was following physics principles, such as energy conservation, became more and more central in their narratives. This study gives important contribution to how networks can be used to model students' thinking in a particular context and provides important knowledge about students' progress in a task in computational physics.

Fully modeling the complex relationships between multiple factors in a theoretical framework requires connecting several statistical techniques. Structural equation modeling (SEM) combines confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), path analysis, and multiple regression. Rather than providing a form of exploratory data analysis, SEM is a confirmatory technique that involves testing and modifying a hypothesized model. Specific tests indicate ways to improve the model, and a variety of fit indices are used to assess the model fit. The implementation of SEM will be shown through the example of testing the physics identity theoretical framework. This includes performing the initial CFA to verify the identity dimensions and assessing model fit. Additionally, the method of modeling multiple groups will be demonstrated by comparing the physics identity model for males and for females. Examples of implementation will be shown in R. Furthermore, the types of research questions to which SEM is most applicable will be described.

Instructors often use engineering design projects to provide students with opportunities to make sense of physics concepts, but do students take them up in this way? I will report on research that approached this question via two contrasting methods: a code-oriented approach based on a classroom observation protocol as well as an insight-oriented approach based on video analysis (Scherr, 2009). The code-oriented approach revealed a rare moment of scientific sense-making during a 6th-grade pneumatics project in which a vocal male student reported having a "good idea." The insight-oriented approach of this good idea revealed that the idea was not Roger's alone  a quieter female student had made a subtle yet substantive contribution that went uncounted. This case illustrates how code-oriented approaches can complement insight-oriented video analysis, while highlighting how some insights can emerge more readily from video data than code counting, with implications for equity in engineering and science classrooms.

The authors have recently proposed a theoretical perspective to guide the development and improvement of physics teacher education (PTE) programs. According to the Development of Habits through Apprenticeship in a Community (DHAC), the primary role of PTE programs is to help novice teachers to develop the requisite habits of mind and habits of practice through apprenticeship in a community centered around master teachers and veteran teachers, all of whom share a similar framework for what physics learning consists of and how it can be realized. This conceptual model explains features of effective PTE programs and makes testable predictions. In this session, the authors will describe briefly the DHAC theoretical perspective and propose a research agenda to test it, refine it, and build on it.

"The formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill. To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old questions from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science." (Einstein & Infield, 1938)
We present results from a project, The dynamics of learners' engagement and persistence in science, funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (#3475). In this work, we first identify exemplars of students' doing science, working with a team of scientists to vet candidate episodes from existing data as well as new data collected in undergraduate courses. We then analyze each case, to understand what we can of its particular dynamics. Finally, we look across the cases for patterns. In this presentation, we discuss one finding: Six of the nine cases involve students working to articulate and motivate problems, where by "problem," we mean an inconsistency or gap in understanding. This work of problematizing, we contend, reflects disciplinary practices in science: Doing science involves having and expressing uncertainty and confusion, and working within realms of uncertainty to pin down what, precisely, is not understood. We argue for valuing students' attempts at articulating a problem as scientific activity, and the articulation of a problem as a scientific achievement in its own right. Drawing on our analysis, we present responsive teaching moves and strategies that can support students' problematizing.

We will present the preliminary results of an assessment of student attitudes toward an introductory course for pre-health students that focuses on the physics of biomedical technologies. The course follows a partially flipped classroom model and incorporates multimedia elements including video interviews with biomedical experts, an online homework system, and original texts. Student attitudes were measured using the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey, additional survey questions specific to the course, and student interviews. Students' conceptual understanding of the physics material and its application in biomedical technology was also assessed. The results of the IPLS course will be compared to those of the traditional course, which was taught concurrently and covered similar physical concepts.

Life Science students in required Introductory Physics courses pose an intriguing challenge to the PER community.  This talk explores UMD's response to the pedagogical issues of and content revisions needed in IPLS courses, as life science students often are resistant to and question the biological relevance and authenticity of the subject matter.  To address this student response, we advocate for the creation of course revisions built on a theoretical framework that encompasses biological authenticity; authentic scientific practice; student-centered, active learning; and attention to affect--all coupled to iterative revision with experience.  We do this through a discussion of how prior and current PER work can be used to form a theoretical framework for content revision and course development, providing both existing illustrative examples from the UMD NEXUS/Physics project (www.nexusphysics.umd.edu) and newly-developed examples from the Understanding and Overcoming Barriers to Using Mathematics in Science project as context.

When looking at learning on short time scales, we find evidence that students' gestures and words both play a role in how new ideas develop. We use the conceptual blending framework to describe the creation of new knowledge in the moment - perhaps fleetingly, never to be used again, perhaps more permanently. Regardless of the time scale of the effect, blending is a model that lets us describe meaning that is emergent in the moment. So, can blending help us answer questions about the definition of learning? Or is it a just-so story, one that doesn't provide a next step for our study of knowledge and learning?

In 2011, the Technion  Israel Institute of Technology launched a special program, Views, whose objective is to help alleviate the shortage in high-quality high school STEM teachers in Israel. Views invites Technion graduates to study towards an additional bachelor's degree in STEM education. In its first year, 60 students enrolled in the program; this year, the program has attracted over 300. The increase in the number and quality of students enrolling necessitated substantial reform of the teacher preparation courses. We will review the theoretical underpinning of the reformed program of the physics education track; discuss in detail the design of one of the physics teaching methods courses; and present preliminary findings from a study that followed the students throughout this course, focusing on challenges these pre-service teachers experienced in the design and teaching of engaging lessons in physics, and on our support of the students in this process.

Intuitive reasoning and communication about abstract science concepts are often achieved through the use of ontological metaphors: metaphors about what kind of entity something is.  Previous work has shown that both students and experts can productively coordinate multiple metaphors for energy, particularly energy as a substance and energy as a vertical location, and that this coordination can be modeled using the framework of conceptual blending.  We apply this blending analysis to a group of students trying to understand the mechanism for atomic emission spectra.  The students create a blended mental space that enables them to arrive at a conceptual resolution.  The blended ontology is useful to these students in resolving their disagreement, and the blending framework is useful to researchers in understanding how the students did this.

While Fauconnier and Turner's theory of conceptual blending is a theory of the mind that focuses on the individual, we demonstrate that it can also be used as a tool for analysis of group discourse. Building on sociocultural theories that consider cognition a social process, we propose blending theory as a descriptive and analytic tool for use in examining the processes of collective reasoning.  We present data from focus groups at CU Boulder in which Modern Physics students engage in reasoning about quantum phenomena and negotiate ontological conceptions of quantum entities such as electrons and photons (i.e. negotiating what kind of a thing an electron or photon is). We present a conceptual blending analysis of group discourse within this context, and show how conceptual blending theory can be used to describe both collectively constructed blends and more traditional individual blends.

In conducting large-scale research efforts which seek to determine the effect of active learning and Learning Assistant support on student outcomes, we routinely collect massive amounts of data from a variety of measurement instruments. Each of these data sources carries with it implicit assumptions about learning. For example, pre-post concept inventory and gain scores assume a cognitive theory of learning, where the latent construct resides in an individual's singular mind. On the other hand, characterizations of student interactions within a collective classroom network assume at least a socio-cognitive (if not sociocultural) view on learning, where interactions between individuals contribute to development of understanding or sophistication. Using different data sources such as these to define distinct variables within the same quantitative model requires theoretical justification and articulation of an explicit learning theoretical framework. In this presentation we describe our work in dealing with these issues.

We examine how math, physics, communication skills and other relevant ideas from undergraduate physics get utilized in optics and photonics workplaces by entry-level employees who have recently finished school. Nearly all of our research interests lie beyond content learning goals and emphasizes the context, goals, representations, and tools that define professional STEM practice. Our methodology involves a large scale (N = 100+) qualitative study with in-depth (1 hour long) semi-structured interviews. Challenges include identifying appropriate samples across diverse contexts (even a limited field like optics has very diverse workplace practices), triangulating views on workplace skills (entry-level employee perspectives vs managers vs HR), making personal connections with a wide range of industry folks despite being an outsider from academia, organizing and analyzing large scale qualitative data, and trying to conduct and communicate research that both academically trained physicists and industrial physicists and engineers find relevant.

There are two important affordances of interviews I take advantage of in my work. The first is the ability to respond adaptively to interviewee's ideas. Rather than setting activities and research questions in stone beforehand, clinical interviews afford a mix of preparation and adaptation. This allows me to, in-the-moment, probe interesting patterns of reasoning and understanding that might emerge unexpectedly. The second affordance of interviews is that they allow for focused video data collection. This allows me to capture an interview without needing to pre-define what aspects of student reasoning I want to capture. To illustrate these points, I'll provide an example of how I designed, performed, and analyzed interviews around quantitative approximations in math and physics problems.

The goal of our work is to investigate how active learning methods and Learning Assistant support impact student outcomes. As part of this work, we are developing a classroom observation protocol that will allow us to identify features of active learning methods and its facilitation that are predictors of learning gains, achievement, retention, and persistence. By focusing on the active portions of a class we are making the assumption that it is in the co-construction of answers that meaningful learning and development occurs. Other protocol design decisions, like classification of the tasks that students are being asked to engage with and their level of engagement in those tasks, involve similar theoretical assumptions. In this presentation we will describe our theoretical framework and our resulting observation protocol design.

The physics department at Texas State University has implemented a Learning Assistant (LA) program in our introductory course sequences. We use a blended theoretical framework of physics identity and communities of practice to examine the impacts of program participation. Previously we have reported evidence of physics identity development from analysis of interviews with LAs and written reflections. Our data now include video of weekly LA preparation sessions as well, which allows us to examine relationships between individual LAs' self-concepts and self-reported practices (in interviews) and their observed practices (in LA prep sessions), and to analyze the degree of alignment between the two. The processes of data collection and collaborative analysis are interspersed, with themes and questions emerging from analyses shaping interview questions. In this session, we will discuss affordances and constraints of this open-ended approach and of the data sources we have available, and findings of our study to date.

At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, we have completed the implementation of our redesigned introductory physics course for life science (IPLS) majors. The new course aligns introductory physics concepts with authentic biological applications. We were influenced by cognitive theories of learning to reform the pedagogy to confront or build upon students' prior knowledge and intuitions in order to develop more expert-like understandings. This reformed pedagogy, implemented in the lecture/studio format [1,2], fosters student participation and enculturation into the practices of the discipline, as advocated by situated models of learning. We will present data on the effectiveness of this course, including results from well-known concept inventories such as the FCI and CSEM, and student performance on exam questions. We will make comparisons to data collected prior to the course transformation and present a review of student survey data, C-LASS results, and comments from faculty teaching the course.

While constructing their understanding in various science areas, students go through transitional phases that may involve richly developed and consistently used mental models. These transitional models are unique cognitive structures composed of elements of both scientifically accepted and the commonly used initial alternative models.  Such transitional models have been previously referred to as hybrid models or blend models. We will discuss the nature of model blending in the context of sound propagation and the issues that surface in their eliciting.

Design based research assumes a complex learning system and allows for researching cognition in context. Such research designs involve systematically observing and understanding learning while also designing curriculum, pedagogy, or contexts. The goal of design-based research is not to improve a specific context (though it may do so); the goal is to contribute to models and theories of how learners think. In our work, we create curricular modules based on research and then observe the curriculum in practice, paying special attention to instances when what happens in the classroom deviates from what we anticipate. We call these "rich points" after Agar's work (2000). Such events may indicate that elementary school students misinterpreted the activity goals (a local problem) or struggled to complete tasks we expect to be trivial (which may have implications for how children learn). Identifying such events through observations and discussion uncover new research questions and directions.

Problem solving is an important part of learning physics at all levels.  In our work, we study students' in-class problem solving in upper-division physics courses.  We are particularly interested in how students interact with each other and with the instructor to use mathematics and build meaning in solving physics problems.

In our Electromagnetic Fields course, students spend the majority of class time solving problems in small groups; the instructor occasionally interrupts or assists them. From video data of students' problem solving, we abstract the students' and instructor's epistemological frames and frame shifts.  We look for trends in how students shift between frames during problem solving, and how the instructor's framing affects the students'.  From this quantitative work on framing trends comes new theory at the junction of framing and interaction analysis.

We present an analysis of interview data and written work from a freshman engineering student, Marya, to illustrate the substantive role of affect in her learning experiences within a reformed introductory physics course. Marya described how, through this course, she shifted from being intimidated by physics to feeling excited about and empowered to do physics. We claim that at the heart of Marya's transformation is a shift in her attitudes and dispositions with respect to struggle, confusion, and uncertainty in the doing of science. We see this shift as an example of meta-affective learning-- i.e., the development of productive feelings and dispositions for navigating intellectual challenges. Marya described how she came to see physics as a pursuit of understanding rather than being about absolutes. Correspondingly, she shifted from feeling anxious about "being wrong" to taking pleasure in exploring ideas and making discoveries. Marya's transformation invites us to attend carefully to the role of meta-affect in science, and to foster students' productive dispositions with respect to struggle, confusion, and uncertainty as an important target in science education.

Participation frameworks in classrooms are co-constructed and co-maintained by the interactional work of teachers and students. We show how sequential, multimodal analysis of video records can reveal the embodied resources participants enlist to achieve transformations in participation frameworks during group-work when a teacher has been called over to help in a middle school Project-Based Inquiry Science (PBIS) course. Our ethnomethodological analysis traces the process of how an epistemically asymmetrical, teacher-led Initiation, Response, Evaluation (IRE) sequence is re-negotiated into an epistemically symmetrical, student-led inquiry sequence that eventually excludes the teachers' contributions. Our multimodal analysis is able to show how students' sensitivity and responsiveness to prosodic cues enable them to differentiate known-answer questions from felicitous, information-seeking questions. Creating opportunities for and sustaining student-led inquiry sequences are interactional achievements rather than solely the achievement of curricular design and therefore require fine-grained video analyses of classroom interaction.

How does student collaboration, both within small groups and between these groups, change in an intensive lab setting? We answer this research question by studying the IMPRESS (Integrating Metacognitive Practices and Research to Ensure Student Success) summer experience - a bridge program for first generation college and deaf/hard of hearing students designed to teach them how to reflect on, evaluate, and change their own thinking. The research team collected video data for the entire two week period, capturing small group and group to group interactions from a variety of angles.  We apply social network analysis (SNA), a well suited approach for studying individual student integration into a group as well as the dynamics of the group as a whole, to the video data. SNA uses the notion of nodes and ties to represent students and interactions between them. This method of analysis gives us a way to describe the IMPRESS students' collaboration quantitatively and visually in order to answer our research question.

Video analysis of students engaged in physics discussions has led to many insights into how students think about and participate in explanation-building and problem-solving in physics. However, analysis of video-records of students' discussions on topics beyond physics content can illustrate expansive uses of video-analysis tools, while simultaneously expanding our toolbox for analyzing students' understanding of physics. I present our ongoing analysis of video-records of engineering students engaged in discussions of socio-scientific issues in clinical focus-group settings, focused on the shifting moral and epistemic stances adopted by students in the discussion. Merging their stance-taking dynamic with fine-grained attention to the content of their talk provides insights into characterizing what perspectives students adopt in their utterances and how these might (or might not) align with stakeholders in the socio-scientific issue. The analysis highlights the role of attending to word choice, gestures, postures, talk sequences, and register changes in making claims about students' stances and perspectives.

One of the major problems in training of future teachers is finding an authentic environment where they can practice new approaches to teaching and learning. Ideally, you want to place your students with reformed in-service teachers but unfortunately often this is not possible. In our department we took a different approach. We created Project lab course which pre-service physics teachers take twice: first time as students (in their first year of studies) and second time as future teachers (in their 4th or 5th year). As first year students they work on open-ended experimental projects. During their second time, already enrolled in the Physics Teacher preparation program, they design project tasks for first year students, observe groups of students solving problems and evaluate their reports using scientific abilities rubrics. I will describe logistical details of such clinical experience and present examples of pre-service teacher work and their reflections on the experience.

What does it look like to create educational spaces that reduce barriers between the classroom and the "real world"? We report on two research strands (Transformative Experiences (TE) and Definitional Ownership (DO)) that examine related goals: students use ideas constructed in class (a concept or a definition) to "see" their everyday world in new and meaningful ways. (E.g. "I am now constantly thinking about how light rays travel" and "I see thresholds everywhere now!") Research on these strands require methodological innovations; we will discuss novel analysis methods as well as our ongoing efforts to connect with existing methodologies and research strands. For instance, the following shared theme has emerged from our joint work: positioning students as accountable authors (Greeno, 2006) of scientific concepts plays a role in an expansive framing (Engle, 2006; Engle, et al, 2012) of classroom activity; such framing, we hypothesize, fosters both TE and DO.

Informal physics learning environments are often highly complex and can vary widely in terms of format, goals, and participants. Effective assessments of informal settings need to align with the rules and norms of the environment in order to accurately reflect students' knowledge and experiences. In the case of informal learning that is exploratory and self-directed, formalized assessments such as concept inventories with multiple choice or Likert-style questions may not be appropriate. Observational data is one means of capturing the dynamics of such informal environments. We have spent the past three years collecting video from afterschool sessions where K-8 children and university students work together on open-ended, hands-on physics activities. In our afterschool program, many independent activities take place simultaneously; to capture a sample of these activities, we have structurally embedded and normalized daily video/audio recording for participants. Based on the recorded interactions between participants, we have developed research questions by applying a socio-cultural lens. We analyze moments of "rich" interaction using an activity theoretic framework and have characterized the pedagogical moves by university student volunteers, the response of K-8 students to these moves and the generation of scientifically creative ideas by K-8 students. These research findings inform our own program design and contribute to the broader understanding of teaching and learning physics in informal environments.

Previously at the University of Arkansas (UA), and now at West Virginia University (WVU), we have led physics teacher preparation programs as part of the Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC). Our invitation to apply as one of the first primary program institutions was initiated by our NSF program officer, based on his familiarity with our reformed introductory course. Years of student interviews supported that it was both the opportunity to engage in an  environment supporting real learning with their peers and having professors who felt education was important that empowered students to choose a teaching career. 15 years after having its first PhysTEC graduate, UA remains in the 5+Club. At WVU, we are also seeing significant impact from these factors. We will discuss the characteristics reported by the students as most impactful on their decision to teach, and shown by our research to have strong correlation with improved learning.

In this study, we investigate how Learning Assistant (LA)-student interactions are related to educational outcomes in active learning STEM courses. We use a retrospective survey methodology which relies on the natural variation in experiences and background of a large sample of college students in these courses. The Learning Assistant Survey of Practices (LASP) was administered in Fall 15' in collaborative classrooms supported with LAs in a large public Hispanic-Serving Institution.  The survey study focuses on how classroom interactions with LAs are associated to academic performance, affective outcomes, and career aspirations. LA practices under examination include the frequency of interactions, types of conversations between LAs and students, discussion facilitation, conditions that encourage student participation, and positioning acts.  In the current presentation, we will discuss the theoretical framework that guided the development of the instrument and preliminary results.

Interdisciplinary thinking and reconciliation is integral to developing a coherent understanding of science. Significant research has gone into addressing this problem, particularly in the context of biology and physics. Projects like NEXUS resulted in the development of courses and materials that are meaningful to students across the disciplines and can serve as prototypes for similar endeavors. The development of these research-based courses has created a need for new assessment tools. We outline the preliminary stages of development of an instrument to assess how students connect essential ideas across introductory science disciplines and how students expect the disciplines to relate. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 biology majors enrolled in a physics course. The students were asked to explain everyday interdisciplinary phenomena as well as to describe their attitudes toward different disciplines and making connections between them. An analysis of these interviews is a first step toward developing a framework for an interdisciplinary assessment.

Effectively teaching an Introductory Physics for the Life Sciences (IPLS) course means engaging life science students in a subject matter for which they may not have considerable preexisting interest. While we have found that the inclusion of topical examples of relevance to life-science students can help to engage students whose initial interest in physics is less developed, we have found that the inclusion of biological content is just one of several dimensions supporting student engagement in IPLS. When describing what is salient to them about their IPLS experiences, students are just as quick to cite particular pedagogical structures and supports as they are to cite issues relating directly to content choices. In this talk we begin to unpack this complex interplay of content and pedagogy in fostering student engagement in the IPLS classroom. We also describe the role that explicit messaging around disciplinary coherence may play in students' experiences.

With the help of digital technology, we can nowadays design inquiry-based learning materials on topics that were traditionally out of experimental reach. One example is using an interactive whiteboard and the software Algodoo to allow students to "create" and "throw" planets into orbits around the Sun. As students engage in this immersive exercise and make sense of what is going on, they intuitively draw on their everyday embodied experiences of throwing objects and using touch-screen devices, as well as their ideas about the universe, physics formalisms and computer simulations. The conceptual blending framework allows us to make better sense of what students bring into such a complex activity and how we can help them gain a physicist-like understanding of the relationships between the "universe out there", physics formalisms, computer simulations and their everyday world.

The Learning Assistant (LA) Student Supported Outcomes (LASSO) project collects multi-disciplinary data from LA-using institutions across the country. The data falls into three categories: (1) student data (e.g. pre & post test scores, gender, and ethnicity), (2) course data (e.g. discipline, LA-uses, & instructor), and (3) institution data (e.g. institution type & term type). In this investigation, we develop a theoretical framework that is based in Critical Race Theory and Cultural Historical Activity Theory. To examine the dynamic interactions between varying components of the activity system, we develop Multi-Level Models that nest data within other sets of data. In our models student level data is nested within course level data, which is nested within institution level data. This allows us to measure and control for the complex interactions between various classroom and institutional contexts when analyzing student outcomes. In this sessions we will examine the impacts of LAs on diverse students and contexts.

This session is about how diverse research projects developed research questions and chose methodologies using observational data. The focus in the session is not particular populations, but rather on how access to observational data shapes the kinds of research questions and methods available to us. Projects include from an informal program that blends children and university students (Hinko); computational classrooms for grade schoolers (Hansen&Harlow); intensive lab experiences for incoming university students (Chase&Zwolak); and upper-division physics courses (Nguyen&Chari).  Across all projects, we explore observational data gives affordances and constraints to the kinds of research available for us to do.  More broadly, we explore questions of how methods and research questions co-evolve in light of access to particular kinds of data.

Conceptual blending, as developed by Fauconnier and Turner, is an approach to analyze how cognition relies on individuals drawing on and integrating several mental input spaces to spontaneously create so-called blends. Blending has recently received increasing attention in physics education research as a theoretical approach to study teaching and learning. In this symposium, we present conceptual blending as a theoretical framework, provide empirical examples of blending analyses, and, in an open panel-dialogue format following the presentations, explore how blending can be interpreted and applied in our field of study. The audience will get to know more about conceptual blending and how it can be applied in empirical analysis.

The introductory physics for life science (IPLS) course presents an exciting, but challenging, opportunity to make physics an integral part of the professional development of biologists and health professions.  Helping students develop physics perspectives and habits of minds (e.g. quantitative modeling) is essential, as well as focusing on physics content most relevant to biologists. Therefore, work in this area has focused on designing curriculum that includes authentic biological problems, promotes interdisciplinary scientific thinking, and builds coherence between physics and biology.  These new pedagogical perspectives then must be joined with the already existing models of student learning for a comprehensive framework.    The demands of this course are giving rise to the development of new theoretical frameworks, research-based transformations, and assessments.  In this session,�this PER work from diverse institutions will be presented, followed by discussion to explore common and divergent theoretical bases for curricular choices, pedagogies, and research strategies.

The number of physics departments utilizing undergraduate Learning Assistants (LAs) has been rapidly growing in recent years. This symposium brings together multiple research groups within the Learning Assistant Alliance that are investigating the impacts of Learning Assistant model adoption on both the students enrolled in LA-supported classes and the LAs themselves. Though the research goals of each of our groups are aligned in many respects, we are all focused on answering different research questions. As such, we are each using a set of research methods based on our respective theoretical perspectives on teaching and learning, and specific research questions. In our talks we will each describe our research methodology, along with presenting results from our individual projects. The discussion time will focus on the extent to which our theoretical perspectives and research methods overlap, the value in some of the differences, and how we might better converge for common goals.

An initial and enduring goal for PER has been understanding and improving students content knowledge, an enterprise that has employed now-familiar methodologies of interviews, pre/post paradigms, and concept inventories. More recently, the field has extended its work to consider factors that influence how students learn content, and new methodologies have been employed. The speakers in this session have research goals that lie further from traditional content outcomes, and require methodologies that are less common in PER. Each speaker in this session will focus on: identifying our non-content goal (that is, how did we arrive at this goal as an outcome), characterizing these goals (that is, how are we making progress on articulating/operationalizing this goal), and developing/selecting methodologies to make progress on research related to this goal.  A discussant will then lead a conversation on ways in which researchers can identify and engage in unfamiliar methodologies.

This workshop will focus on general guidance and specific suggestions aimed at increasing the number of high quality physics and astronomy education proposals submitted to NSF. The most important target for such proposals is the Division of Undergraduate Educations IUSE (Improving Undergraduate STEM Education) Program. We will provide a general overview of the program, the review process, an overview of the IUSE: EHR (Education and Human Resources Directorate) portfolio in physics and astronomy, and recommendations regarding working within the existing system for the maximum benefit of the physics and astronomy education community. We will also discuss recent developments in the S-STEM program. All S-STEM awards today are expected to be knowledge-generating and disseminate that knowledge to the broader STEM education community. This makes research projects possible in many areas including recruitment, retention, advising, and the efficacy of bridging programs, peer tutoring, and faculty mentoring for STEM majors.
