wordstring2 = ''' The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program was initially authorized in 2002. SUNY Buffalo State initially
received Noyce funding in 2004. There have been approximately 40 scholars in Phase 1 and 26 scholars in Phase
2. Fifteen of these scholars were physics concentrations. Of these 15, four scholars are currently teaching physics
or physical science in New York state. Another six scholars are currently in education, but not necessarily
teaching physics or are not in the New York area. Of the remaining scholars, two have not yet completed the
program. The selected Noyce physics scholars were observed, in the spring of 2015 semester, using the
Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP). Each scholar was observed several times余 the observations
were pre足arranged with paired observers. The resulting scores, with sub足scores, will be reported along with interrater
reliability data. This data is a sub足set of a larger study of Noyce Scholars at Buffalo State.'''
