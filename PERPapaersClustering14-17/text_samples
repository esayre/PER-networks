The Video Resource for Professional Development of University Physics Educators is being developed to support a wide range of university physics educators (four-year university faculty, two-year-college faculty, graduate teaching assistants, and undergraduate learning assistants) in engaging with key issues in teaching and learning. Based on compelling classroom video of best-practices university physics instruction, the resource is organized into "video workshops" that each introduce a significant topic in the teaching and learning of physics, such as formative assessment or cooperative learning. The topic is introduced through a captioned video episode of introductory physics students in the classroom, chosen to prompt collaborative discussion. Discussion questions prompt participants who view the episode to reflect on their pedagogical beliefs and on their own practice. The Video Resource will provide materials to be incorporated into a variety of professional development situations, including self-organized groups of professors, graduate TA training, LA pedagogy courses, and online professional development communities.

Visual elements are integral components of todays textbooks. The applications for these elements vary from simply breaking up the textual narrative ... to establishing a supplemental or an alternative narrative ... to summarizing or communicating key concepts. To better understand the impact of visual elements in the pedagogical framework of textbooks we have created a taxonomy to identify their roles. The taxonomy is being used to analyze the number and placement of visual elements in both a traditional text and a non-traditional one. The resulting analysis is being used as a basis for designing additional visual elements.

Research has demonstrated that using visual cues to focus students' attention on relevant areas in diagrams and animations can increase comprehension and facilitate problem solving. In this study we investigate the effectiveness of visual cues and correctness feedback in conceptual physics problems containing a diagram with respect to comprehension and transfer of physics concepts. Students (N=90) enrolled in an introductory mechanics course were individually interviewed. During each interview students worked through four sets of problems containing a diagram. Each problem set contained an initial problem, six isomorphic training problems, and a transfer problem. Answers and explanations were given verbally. Students in the cued conditions saw visual cues on the training problems, and those in the feedback conditions were told if their responses were correct or incorrect. We discuss the influence of both cueing and feedback on students' reasoning.

It is commonly expected that, after instruction, students will consciously and systematically construct reasoning chains that start from established scientific principles and lead to well-justified predictions. Poor student performance on exams is often attributed to a lack of understanding or an inability to construct inferential reasoning chains. Psychological research, however, seems to indicate that thinking processes often follow paths that are strikingly different from those outlined above. The extended heuristic-analytic theory of thinking and reasoning suggests that two types of cognitive processes are involved in building inferences: heuristic and analytical. Some researchers argue that metacognition mediates the connection between the two. In this talk, we will illustrate the applicability of this theory to student performance on written questions and describe the theory's relevance to efforts to probe student metacognitive abilities.

Much recent work in physics education research has focused on identity. Since physics identity is related to physics career choice and persistence, it is valuable to understand what helps students develop a physics identity and what other attitudes are related to physics identity. Recent work suggests characteristics of interdisciplinary thinking are related to having a higher physics identity. However, the nature of this connection is still unexplained. This qualitative study examines students' interdisciplinary actions and beliefs, particularly with respect to their physics classes, as well as their physics identity. Through analysis of interviews and classroom observations, we seek to explain how these actions and beliefs may be related to students' physics identity, i.e. the possible mechanisms by which one may influence the other and how such mechanisms are activated.

We describe the results of an introductory physics Massively Open Online Course (MOOC) offered through Coursera during summer and fall 2013. This MOOC, modeled after an on-campus implementation of an introductory mechanic course, engages students in activities involving interactive lectures, homework, exams, forum discussion, and laboratories. Student demographics, participation, and performance on various assessment tools (e.g., the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation) will be presented. Specific challenges in data collection will also be discussed.

This presentation reports on a comparative study on students' problem solving performances when they use one of the two most popular open resources: either their own equation sheets or instructor-provided equation sheets. The study was carried out for four semesters in an introductory-level physics course. Student cohorts of previous two semesters were allowed to bring their own equation sheets for their tests whereas the student cohorts of the latter two semesters were provided the instructor prepared equation sheets. The results of the two implementations were compared using students' test scores and scores on various problem-solving categories indicated by a problem-solving rubric. This study revealed a relationship between student performance and the quality of their equations sheets. In addition, we found that use of instructor-prepared equation sheets have more positive influence on student performance as compared to student prepared equation sheets.

Often, research into physics education is focused on seeking out practices that improve student outcomes--such as improved conceptual gains, motivation, etc.--in comparison to the status quo of traditional/unreformed practices. Recently, we have instead validated a construct of student "disaffection" to identify practices that are significantly associated to this undesirable, negative student attitude. Using regression analysis on nationally representative college student data, we identify high school physics experiences that are associated to student disaffection including, importantly, having a teacher who relies more regularly on lecturing. There are gender interactions as well, such that women's disaffection is strongly related to their evaluations of their high school physics teachers (lower evaluations are associated to higher disaffection), whereas men show no such relationship.

Assessing student performance becomes challenging when course enrollment becomes very large (~10^5 students). As part of an introductory physics Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) offered by Georgia Institute of Technology, students submit video reports on force and motion labs. Peer evaluation of reports provides the primary method for evaluating student laboratory work. This paper describes the methods developed and used to guide students in evaluating each others' video lab reports when the course is offered in summer 2013 and fall 2013. Results of how students' peer evaluation compares to experts' evaluation will be presented.

Energy Tracking Representations [1,2], developed by Seattle Pacific University Energy Project researchers, are designed to track energy as it transfers and transforms in complex, real-world scenarios. Learners represent transfers and transformations by arrows that connect symbols representing forms of energy (e.g., K --> T represents a transformation of kinetic to thermal energy within an object, and K --> K represents a transfer of kinetic energy between two objects). Recent professional development efforts have supported teachers in not only identifying different kinds of transfer and transformation processes, but also in developing models for those processes. In this talk, we offer examples of the models K-12 teachers negotiated for specific transfers and transformations, and describe the effect of the negotiation process on their understanding of energy.

We present the impact of incorporating physics education research-based (PER) materials into our lecture-supported mini-studios for introductory algebra-based physics. These courses are being redesigned to provide improved integration of traditional lecture, recitation, and laboratory components for a large number of introductory students who cannot be served by our limited number of full-studio courses. Previously, worksheet materials for the three-hour lab portion of the mini-studio were mostly in-house designed. We have updated these worksheets with exercises from the Maryland Open Source Tutorials and the Minnesota Context-Rich Problem archive. Our previous results have shown lecture-supported mini-studios to perform similarly to or better than studio-based courses on standard conceptual and attitudinal assessments. We will investigate the sustainability of this trend with our redesigned worksheets, and document our struggles to identify existing PER-based materials for some topics.

The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)[1] identify eight practices as essential to science and engineering, and several of these emphasize the role of students' constructing explanations, engaging in argumentation, and communicating scientific information. However, few teacher-training programs instruct teachers on how to facilitate discourse in the classroom. Developed at Arizona State University, Modeling Instruction[2] emphasizes the role of student discourse in the construction of scientific knowledge by having students participate in large group conversations called whiteboard meetings. However, the novelty of this conversation format can inhibit student participation and make the facilitation of this discourse mode quite challenging. This research is a portion of one high school teacher's self study analyzing his experiences facilitating discourse in his attempt to move students closer to those practices espoused by the NGSS.

This study seeks to understand the patterns of formation of spontaneous learning communities outside the classroom from the students of a calculus-based introductory college physics class that is a studio-format course implementing the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE). We build up a network pattern among students from the self-reported data about who works with whom every week during the whole semester. Our study also analyzes the relationship between students' network position or status as they work together in groups outside the classroom, their interactions in the classroom, and their performance on homework and exams.

Georgia State University's Learning Assistant program recruits undergraduates to assist with instruction in our introductory algebra-based physics courses. Although the Learning Assistant model has been shown to be effective at enhancing student learning, little is known about the obstacles that Learning Assistants face. How do these obstacles evolve over the semester, and how do Learning Assistants deal with them? In order to investigate these questions, we interviewed four learning assistants who were assigned to SCALE-UP studio physics courses. We arranged four interviews with each Learning Assistant and examined all of their weekly essays written for the required science pedagogy course. We analyzed this data using constant comparative analysis, a technique associated with the grounded theory approach to qualitative research. The Learning Assistants described many barriers that they encountered including student disengagement, difficulty finding the right question to ask, and others.

Prior research has emphasized the importance of recognition to physics identity development. In this study, we examine the coherence between students' perceptions of their physics teacher recognizing them and the beliefs of physics teachers with regards to students. We draw on data from four case studies of physics teachers and their classes. Our quantitative analysis revealed that one of the teachers, Dr. D, had a different coherence pattern. His students also perceived greater recognition and identified more as being a "physics person" than the students of the other teachers. Focusing in on a student with the lowest coherence, Kristina, we examine the ways in which Dr. D's actions served to help her feel recognized -- actions that superseded his beliefs about her. Our results indicate that despite his beliefs (about her and his other students on average), his actions facilitated students seeing themselves in positive ways with respect to physics.

In most energy scenarios, thermal energy is produced and dissipated. For example, when a ball rolls to a stop, kinetic energy transforms into thermal energy that spreads into the environment. The ball's movement is a perceptible indicator of the presence of kinetic energy. The thermal energy, however, is likely to be imperceptible, and as the ball slows, the decrease of a perceptible indicator can seem to suggest a violation of the principle of energy conservation. We present data of teachers-as-learners working to identify evidence of energy which has lost its perceptible indicators. We argue that mechanisms of energy transformation constitute evidence of imperceptible energy for learners.

For at least 90 years, physics educators have attempted to improve instructional practices through systematic analysis of student-learning data. I will review some of the highlights of these investigations in order to focus on key issues and problems that have surfaced. For example, although some analysis of students' physics ideas had occurred in the 1930s and 1940s, implementation of instructional materials based closely on such research did not take place until the 1970s. I will also address the evolution in diagnostic instruments and offer perspective on issues related to statistical analysis of assessment data, the validity of observational protocols, and trade-offs between practicality and reliability. *Supported in part by NSF DUE #1256333

A preliminary study in a spring 2013 introductory physics for life sciences (IPLS) course focused on a metacognitive activity of reflecting on a chosen homework problem during the initial portion of each lab over the duration of the course, with the assistance of a reflection rubric. Artifact data was gathered from a MPEX pre-post survey, students' reflection attempts and exam solutions, and a post-test reflection survey. Combined data suggested that students were of mixed-to-positive opinion of the metacognitive activity. While students appeared to benefit somewhat, many chose to obviate the exercise a priori by obtaining the correct solution for the homework problem in advance. To explore the robustness of these indications, implementations to the exercise were made to be more ergonomic to the course material and prevent this occurrence. We revisit the preliminary data from last spring in light of the fall semester's progress.

As part of a new effort at the University of Maine to investigate the learning and teaching of concepts in thermodynamics and electronics that are integral to both undergraduate physics and engineering programs, we have been examining student learning in electrical engineering and physics courses on electric circuits and electronics. A major goal of this work at the physics-engineering interface is to probe the extent to which the nature of student understanding (including the prevalence of specific difficulties) depends upon the disciplinary context. In this talk, I will focus on our efforts to probe student understanding of basic operational-amplifier circuits using free-response questions. Preliminary results from questions administered in both physics and engineering courses will be presented. *This work has been supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.

Models are simplified and abstract representations of real-world phenomena that are used for creating and communicating scientific explanations. In this study we analyze students' use of models in a 30-minute think-aloud lab activity involving basic electronic and optical components. The framework used for our fine-grained analysis of modeling during experimentation was developed independently in the context of curriculum development for upper-division physics laboratories. We review general patterns in students' use of models, describe our coding scheme, and conclude with a discussion of implications for the design of modeling-focused lab activities and lab-appropriate assessments.

Numerous studies have identified student conceptions about buoyancy, but most of those studies involved children younger than 15 years old. As part of developing a standardized static fluids assessment, our research group is seeking to identify which of those conceptions persist into late high school and college. This fall, we used a Likert-style approach to our assessment, asking students to agree or disagree with individual statements (rather than choose from multiple options for a single physical situation). We also videotaped volunteers taking this assessment. This talk will report on some of our preliminary findings.

We invite you to Applied Physics 50*, a team-based and project-based learning community whereby students own their learning.

The wave phenomena typically discussed in introductory physics courses form the foundation for more advanced physics topics such as electrodynamics and quantum mechanics. However, it has been found that many students experience significant difficulties when they attempt to express a distance in terms of the wavelength of a periodic wave. The ability to perform such a basic task correctly is essential for understanding interference and diffraction phenomena. We hypothesized that the poor student performance on this type of task may stem from difficulties with visualizing the situation and reasoning spatially. We administered the Paper Folding Test (PFT) in order to assess students' visual-spatial skills. Then, we probed the relationship between these skills and student performance on tasks in the context of water waves. We have identified consistent and statistically significant differences in PFT scores between students who complete basic wave tasks correctly and those students who do not.

Metacognition, or "thinking about thinking," is known to be central in the practice of expert learners. Western Washington University introductory physics labs for science and engineering majors incorporate activities designed to encourage the development of metacognitive skills. In weekly writing exercises, students reflect on what they knew before instruction, what they learned during instruction, and how they learned it. Analyses of a large sample of student data has led to insights into how students' reflective writing can be used as a valuable source of data. Data will be presented and implications for both research and instruction will be discussed.

This study aims to determine critical factors that explain differences in FCI gains among sections of algebra-based and calculus-based classes. In this study, FCI pre-test scores are found to be only moderately correlated with FCI post-scores and normalized gains, and Lawson CTSR scores are only weakly correlated. We conclude that measures of scientific reasoning ability and the level of prior knowledge of physics are not the most important factors in explaining course section differences. We report also on the development of a rubric for quantifying the degree of FCI content coverage. This work contributes to the PER community's efforts to identify a sufficiently complete set of factors impacting FCI gains and to determine the relative importance of the factors. Work in this area could guide curriculum reform to reduce students' misconceptions about Newtonian Thinking and allow them to learn more physics beyond the topics addressed by FCI.

A gender-gap favoring males in outcomes such as conceptual knowledge, self-efficacy, attitudes and beliefs is common in introductory physics courses [1]. We investigated this issue by measuring students' in the moment stated feelings of self-efficacy and motivation throughout their daily lives, including in an introductory physics course. We also used trait surveys to measure gender gaps in the course consistent with prior research [1]. We found gender differences in physics favoring males on both measures. These findings trace the larger negative effect on female students' attitudes and beliefs about learning physics and their physics self-efficacy to their experiences occurring in the midst of physics instruction. This confronts researchers, educators, and administrators with the need for developing and implementing more equitable physics instruction.

Visual cues overlaid on diagrams and animations can help students attend to relevant features and facilitate problem solving. In this study we investigated the effects of visual cues on students' eye movements as they solved conceptual physics problems. Students (N=80) enrolled in an introductory physics course individually worked through four sets of problems, each containing a diagram, while their eye movements were recorded and provided verbal responses. The problem sets contained an initial problem, six isomorphic training problems, and a transfer problem. Those in the cued condition saw visual cues overlaid on the training problems. Each diagram contained regions that were alternatively relevant to solving the problem correctly or related to common incorrect responses. The cued group more accurately answered the transfer problems (which did not have cues), and their eye movements showed they more efficiently extracted the necessary information from the relevant area than the uncued group. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1138697.

We study the effects of a computer-based training process on pre-service elementary teachers' reasoning on introductory physics problems with diagrams. The training process contains four problem sets that target commonly known nave conceptions in physics. The problems include physics diagrams and text and require conceptual reasoning rather than computation. Each problem set has three training problems followed by solutions, one near transfer problem, and one far transfer problem. We have analyzed students' verbal answers to elucidate the reasoning resources that they activated to construct the different explanations that they gave in response to the problems. We found that the students changed their reasoning dramatically through the process as they were presented with solutions to training problems and later posed a transfer problem. Our results provide insights into students' activation of their resources and the procedures they used to construct their reasoning in response to the training problems.

We have developed and tested prototype online exercises targeted for specific learning objectives in introductory physics. These exercises are delivered in a "mastery" mode. That is, students are given a set of questions; if they do not answer correctly the minimum number required for mastery, they are given access to narrated animated solutions to these questions after which they are presented with a new set of questions. This process continues until the students achieve mastery. We will discuss the design of these questions and their solutions and present preliminary data on student learning from these exercises.

Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) is an important aspect in the preparation of future teachers. The Concepts of Physics (CoP) course at Kansas State University has been recently redesigned to infuse PCK for pre-service elementary teachers. CoP integrates the learning of physics concepts with children's ideas about those concepts. The course is structured around the pedagogical learning bicycle, which bridges the learning of content with pedagogy through metacognitive reflection. As a final class project, students are required to work in groups to develop a lesson plan on one of the topics taught during the semester. In this talk I describe how we assess the impact of the class on students' PCK. We evaluated their projects based on how they incorporated their understanding of children's ideas on the specific topic to develop age-appropriate strategies to facilitate children's learning of these concepts.

One important goal for physics education is to help students develop reasoning patterns similar to those of physicists. But what does a physicist actually do that enables her/him to successfully understand and solve challenging, novel problems? To answer this question we performed fine-grained discourse analysis on video recordings of physics experts attempting to solve novel problems using the framework of resources. We focused on episodes during the problem solving process when experts reasoned towards a deeper understanding of the phenomenon they were observing. By searching for patterns across many episodes, we identified candidate resources with epistemological underpinnings, which help experts when they are making conceptual breakthroughs when solving novel problems. We discuss the frequency with which resource candidates were used by experts and the instructional implications of these findings.

Metacognition, the monitoring and regulation of one's thinking, plays an important role in developing conceptual understanding and facilitating effective problem solving. To date, relatively little work has focused on the role of student metacognition in qualitative inferential reasoning. We have collected audio, video, and real-time written data in order to identify instances of socially mediated metacognition[1] that occur while introductory physics students work through qualitative problems. In particular, we use multi-part questions that tend to elicit inconsistencies in student reasoning, even when students possess the requisite conceptual understanding. This work is part of a broader effort to identify methods for improving students learning in physics by explicitly supporting and enhancing students' metacognitive abilities. Preliminary findings as well as specific examples will be presented. * This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. DUE-1245313, DUE-1245999, and DUE-0962805.

Force, velocity, and acceleration represent an interesting set of related physics concepts in that they are foundational, well-documented and a persistent source of student difficulty even after instruction. As such, this set of related concepts provides a unique conceptual space in which to explore the effects of different question formats and their role in targeting persistent student difficulties during computer-based training and instruction. By prompting students to respond to questions in natural language and subsequently providing immediate question specific feedback, we explore the potential benefit of natural language for targeting specific and persistent difficulties like the assumption of a force in the direction of motion. We report on the design and construction of a simple natural language computer tutor for concepts in one-dimensional force and motion and investigate the relative effectiveness of the natural language question and feedback format versus traditional multiple choice questions and responses.

The acquisition metaphor of learning is often used by teachers of physics: Students acquire a particular concept, and then transfer this concept to new contexts. In particular, one might say students acquire the mathematical concept of "vector addition" and apply it in (transfer it to) numerous physical contexts. In this study, 200 freshmen taking an introductory physics course were asked to calculate the total force, total displacement and total momentum in simple contexts involving vector addition at right angles. Another similar group of 200 students were asked to calculate the net force, net displacement, and net momentum. The students did significantly worse when adding momenta, and they did significantly better when asked to calculate the "net" quantity (rather than the "total" quantity). These results are inconsistent with a basic "acquisition -transfer" perspective of learning. A fine-grained analysis of subsequent interviews and questionnaires was also conducted.

Achieving physics expertise requires various expert skills beyond conceptual understanding, such as mapping between different representations, or devising a qualitative overall plan. Research have shown that the most effective method to develop expertise in any field is through "deliberate practice": carefully designed repetitive practice focused on a specific expert skill. However, most traditional back of the textbook problems are poor candidates of deliberate practice activities, as they often require multiple skills to solve. We will briefly introduce our initial attempts of developing "deliberate practice problems" for introductory mechanics. These highly focused problems are carefully designed to train one aspect of expert skill at a time, utilizing the new "Drag and drop" format of the edX platform to reduce extraneous cognitive load. We will show a couple of example problems, and also report the initial response from students when we deploy those problems in a flipped classroom.

Students' mathematical skill level is often considered a good indicator of their success in introductory physics courses. It is a common expectation that students who meet the prerequisite requirement will be well-prepared; however, this is rarely the case. In a recent study at the Department of Physics and Astronomy of Eastern Kentucky University, a math diagnostic test is given pre-instruction in an algebra-based physics course to evaluate their math skills. We then interviewed six students who were on the borderline in the entrance math diagnostic test. To investigate their physics problem solving skills, we gave them questions that included both math-intensive questions and context rich problems. The connection between students' mathematical skills and their physics problem-solving skills is discussed in detail.

Normalized gains for students participating in Circuit Theater average 49% after one week of activities.

The Inquiry into Radioactivity (IiR) project is developing course materials for radiation literacy. Student thinking about what constitutes ionizing radiation is a major learning difficulty. Most people use "radiation" and "radioactive" interchangeably, and talk of ionizing radiation as "bad stuff" that can transfer to other objects, making them radioactive. These matter -- like ideas persist and interfere with the particle view. This paper reports on a longitudinal study of student thinking. Some students accepted the particle view after investigations with Geiger counters, but others did not adopt the particle view until grappling with atoms and with ionization by alpha, beta, and gamma particles. Thus we reluctantly conclude that brief or incomplete efforts to teach radiation to non-science learners will fail to incite the substantial ontological shift that is essential to understanding radiation as particles.

Physics education research (PER) indicates that research-based instructional strategies (RBIS) such as studio classes and research-based text materials (Physics by Inquiry) could be used widely to improve students' learning gains and conceptual understanding. However, the effectiveness of RBIS is not universal; non-physics majors fail to understand subjects in algebra-based courses at some institutions. This could be due to many reasons, such as different implementations of studio physics or different teaching strategies. Course documents also have impacts on the learning environment. As part of a collaborative study among GSU, GW and UCF, we have collected and analysed available course documents, such as experiments and quizzes. The analysis is based on the differences between course documents (experiments, activities) among these three institutions and comparison of these documents to those prepared by the instructors with PER-based documents.

We examine the effects of training examples on student responses to questions about the relationships between the directions of net force, velocity, and acceleration in one-dimension. Six training conditions were constructed, each dealing exclusively with one combination of net force, velocity, and acceleration (e.g., "given a velocity in this direction, what can you say about the acceleration"?) in a variety of contexts and added to a control condition (no training). While we find that acceleration-velocity and net force-velocity trainings led to the highest overall scores, we also find complex but robust interactions between training and test question types, consistent with hierarchies of student understanding of force and motion in previous works. Based on the empirical data we gathered, we build mathematical models of these hierarchies. We then use those models to predict which combinations of training are most effective, which is in turn suggestive of instructional strategies.

In Fall 2013, Georgia Tech began offering a "flipped" introductory calculus-based mechanics class as an alternative to the traditional large-enrollment lecture class. This class "flips" instruction by introducing new material outside of the classroom through pre-recorded, lecture videos that feature in-video "clicker" questions. Classroom time is spent working in small groups solving problems, practicing scientific communication, and peer evaluation. Video lectures constitute students' initial introduction to course material. We analyze how students engage with online lecture videos via "clickstream" data. Clickstream data consists of time-stamped interactions with the online video player. Plays, pauses, seeks, and other events are recorded when the student interacts with the video player. Patterns in this behavior can emerge and be used to highlight areas of interest in the video and improve the overall video delivery for future iterations of this course.

Although there has been interest in problem/project-based learning in the PER community as an active engagement strategy, most work done to date, however, has focused on introductory courses.

The first version of these coaches was used in the first semester of large calculus-based introductory mechanics courses at UMN. The utility of the coaches depends on their ease of use and their attractiveness to students as well as their efficacy. In this talk, we describe the techniques used to measure the utility of the coaches when used as a part of the introductory course. This talk will also address the natural use of the coaches by different segments of the student population within the class. Q. Ryan, B. Aryal, and J-L. Lin also contributed to this work. This project was partially supported by NSF DUE-0715615 and DUE-1226197.

Understanding issues of diversity and equity in physics has historically taken the lens of documenting broad patterns of participation of women and ethnically underrepresented groups. This work has explored reasons for differing levels in participation including conceptual understanding, physics identity, and student self-efficacy. A common aim of this work has been to examine the impact of these variables on the prevalence of underrepresented groups in physics. We present an alternative lens on diversity and equity that centers on better understanding and supporting student trajectories of participation over time. Drawing from case study data of a biology major in an introductory physics class, we argue that access to a professional community of scientists must start from exposure to, participation in, and developing an affinity towards a variety of scientific practices. We articulate how this perspective informs a model of supporting diverse students who are commonly disenfranchised from physics.

While a number of studies have investigated student understanding of vector addition and subtraction as relevant to introductory physics, virtually all of these studies have only considered the arrow representation of vectors. In this study, we demonstrate that significantly -- and often overwhelmingly -- more students can correctly add and subtract vectors in the textual, component ijk-format compared to the arrow format in both generic and physics contexts. Furthermore, by prompting students for physical explanations of results, we find that students also exhibit an equal if not better understanding in the ijk-format compared to the arrow format. The arrow format typically induces an intuitive application of arrows, often resulting in incorrect answers. Overall, we find that the ijk-format tends to prompt students to use the arrow format correctly (and not vice versa), and this suggests that teaching the arrow format alone may not be as productive as teaching both representations simultaneously.

We have analyzed the performance of students enrolled in University of Colorado Physics I MOOC. The performance of the MOOC students is compared with that of students in the "Brick and Mortar" version of the course, Physics 1110. Identical instruments (FMCE, exams, homework) were used to evaluate both groups. While the completion rate of students enrolled in the MOOC was much lower than for those in the "Brick and Mortar" class, MOOC students performed as well as and had learning gains as great as those in the "Brick and Mortar" class. When MOOC students are compared with a similar group of Physics 1110 students, based on FMCE pre-tests, their performance lags but still compares favorably with that of students in a typical Physics I class.

A collection of targeted math skills questions were developed and incorporated into the standard, weekly homework exercises in a first semester, calculus-based mechanics course for science and engineering majors at the University of Illinois. These questions were designed to test the math skills that would nominally be used during the homework that week. This presentation gives our analysis of the students' performance on the math skills questions as compared with the corresponding physics questions. We conclude by discussing some of the implications of this study in regards to transfer of learning and possible contributing factors toward student difficulties in mechanics, as well as possibilities for improving student performance in calculation-based exercises.

While interdisciplinarity is often considered a worthy goal of education and a tool for better teaching, definitions of interdisciplinarity vary among education researchers and practitioners. In addition, researchers and practitioners usually focus on student performance on coursework that is considered to be interdisciplinary. What this perspective lacks is a consideration of the affective domain, namely student beliefs and attitudes about interdisciplinarity. Building on hypothesized dimensions of interdisciplinarity, we draw from a large-scale national survey to build a useful measure of interdisciplinary affinity. We also investigate how interdisciplinary affinity is related to students' physics and general STEM identities.

This study builds on past research that explored the effect of prior belief on students' ability to draw inferences. Results, indicating an effect of prior belief, are replicated and compared with statistical reasoning ability. 600 students in a calculus-based mechanics course participated in one of two conditions. In the first condition, data tables were presented within a physical context and students were given a short pre-test measuring their beliefs about the context. In the second, the tables were given within a generic context. Compared to students given the generic context, students given the physical context drew valid conclusions more frequently when the data aligned with their prior beliefs but less frequently when the data conflicted with their beliefs. Additionally, 270 students were given the Berlin Numeracy Test to evaluate their statistical numeracy. While results from previous studies have disagreed, in this case, students' numeracy was positively correlated with their correctness.

In addition to struggling with deep comprehension of physics concepts, students also struggle with essential, procedural skills that are necessary for the types of problem solving expected of them during introductory physics classes. Students in both semesters of introductory physics (mechanics and E&M;) and in multiple populations (algebra and calculus-based) have been shown to struggle with the essential skills of computing vector components and vector products. In this presentation, we present data on the effectiveness of a number of training conditions on student fluency with these vector skills. Through the use of simple computer-based training with answer-based feedback, the effects of different types of feedback -- as well as the presentation order of sub-skills and concepts-- are investigated.

"Calibration" is an aspect of metacognition that describes how well students assess their own knowledge. We have been engaged in a multi-year project to investigate the metacognitive calibration of students enrolled in introductory physics and chemistry courses at a small campus of a large public university. When assessed at the end of the semester, we found a large disparity between students' confidence in their ability to answer questions compared to their actual ability to provide the correct answer on a large number of questions that spanned the course material. We further investigated student calibration in a series of interviews designed to examine which question features and student behaviors might lead students to assess their knowledge more accurately. Data from written questions and one-on-one student interviews will be presented, and the implications these have for future investigations into student metacognition will be discussed.

This study was motivated by research findings suggesting that student conceptual and reasoning competence demonstrated on one task often fails to be exhibited on another. Even after targeted instruction, many undergraduate physics students fail to build reasoning chains from fundamental principles even though they possess the required knowledge and skills to do so. Instead, they often rely on a variety of intuitive reasoning strategies. In this study, we examined the extent to which students employ intuitive reasoning across multiple contexts (both related and unrelated). In addition, we wanted to see if the tendency to use a particular class of reasoning approaches (e.g., intuitive or formal) may be attributed to individual student thinking strategies in general. Data from introductory calculus-based physics courses will be presented and implications for instruction will be discussed. *This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.

Effective learners possess a diverse repertoire of metacognitive skills that they consciously deploy to support and guide their thinking. Adopting new thinking approaches is complex and demanding for novice learners, but the process can be facilitated by instructors actively supporting the development of students' metacognitive skills. As part of an ongoing investigation of student reasoning approaches in physics courses, we wish to identify instructional strategies that are effective at promoting the development of metacognitive skills in conjunction with the development of conceptual understanding of physics. We have been probing the effectiveness of such strategies across multiple learning environments (e.g., interactive lectures, laboratory). We will present data from question sequences purposefully designed to evoke metacognitive behavior. Results from individual and group work will be presented and compared. Implications for instruction will be discussed.

In an analysis of correct/incorrect responses during peer instruction in an introductory survey of physics course for undergraduates, students with previous subject experience were found to have a higher correct response rate before and after discussion than all other partner groupings. If a student with previous subject experience was paired with a student with no previous subject experience, there was an increase in correct response rate after discussion but no lasting benefit was found on end-of-unit exams. If a discussion pair consisted of two students with no previous subject experience, correct response rates were low and remained low after discussion. The nature of the pairing appears to influence correct response rates to questions posed during peer instruction and also influences student's attitudes about the course and the value of peer instruction.

Following the positive impact of the lecture-supported mini-studio format on student understanding in our first-semester algebra-based courses, we present the results of implementing the mini-studio format in our second-semester algebra-based courses. The mini-studio format provides improved integration of traditional lecture, recitation, and laboratory components for a large number of introductory students who cannot be served by our limited number of full-studio courses. During the three-hour laboratory portion of the mini-studio, students complete student-centered worksheets containing PER-based materials (e.g., exercises from Maryland Open Source Tutorials, Minnesota Context-Rich Problems, etc.) and then take quizzes on paper. Some students worked in our previous laboratory format, which entailed an instructor-led problem-solving session followed by individual quizzes completed online. We will investigate the effects of the mini-studio format on student understanding of second-semester material and on student attitudes toward physics and compare these results to those of other formats used for our second-semester algebra-based courses.

Studio physics courses and other interactive engagement methods have been found to improve student learning gains at multiple institutions. However, the same level of success is not found in all secondary implementations of these methods. There are several possible explanations for these differences in success, such as institutional differences and instructor effectiveness. As part of a project to explore the essential components for success of algebra-based studio physics courses, we would like to describe and compare characteristics of student populations at institutions with different levels of success. Studio-mode courses may be particularly vulnerable to differences in student populations since their student-centered nature places more responsibility on students. We will present the results of interviews conducted with faculty, student assistants and enrolled students at three universities to explore the characteristics they felt most significantly impacted individual students' success in studio mode courses and how these results inform the larger study.

Students' interactions can be an influential component of an interactive learning environment. We analyze video data of students working together while they learn physics from two consecutive semesters of a calculus-based introductory college physics course that implements the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) curriculum. We consider students' interaction patterns from two different viewpoints. The first is based on their positioning, in terms of equity, during peer interactions. The second is based on the structure of cognitive processes as described in the revised Bloom's Taxonomy. Using comparative analysis we examine the relationship between students' interactions in these two viewpoints and their learning as measured by performance in class exams and conceptual understanding. Additionally, we will attempt to identify the key characteristics and behaviors of "successful students," namely those who are able to fully exploit the affordances of a highly student-centered learning environment that places an emphasis on self-directed learning.

I will report on the results of a study designed to measure the effectiveness of an instructional strategy known as 2-stage exams or collaborative group exams. This exam format first has the students take the exam individually. Once all the students have handed in their individual exams, they organize into collaborative groups of three or four and take the same exam again with only a single copy of the exam being given to each group. Different versions of the group exam featured different subsets of the questions from the individual exam. Questions isomorphic to the exam questions will be administered on the end-of-course diagnostic and comparisons, using the relevant isomorphic question, will be made between the students that saw a given question on the group exam and those that did not.

We are interested to examine patterns of behavior and interactions amongst physics students as they learn in a highly interactive and student-centered learning environment. This environment is an introductory level studio-based ISLE physics class taught at Florida International University. We use a descriptive statistical approach and network analysis to identify productive or unproductive behavioral factors and try to quantify how these factors affect students' learning. We will report on interesting features and patterns that we discovered. In particular we consider the relative importance of factors such as how students participate in peer discussions while working on class activities, how much they take advantage of informal learning groups outside of class time, how they participate in whole-class discussions, and even whether students arrive on time to class or not.

A metacognitive exercise in problem solving was given to an introductory physics for life sciences (IPLS) class over the course of the fall 2013 and spring 2014 semester. The exercise featured scaffolding in the form of a rubric students could use to note where they struggled in a group problem solving effort. One of the concerns was that students who are not physics majors do not necessarily have the same epistemic framework as physics majors would for the classroom. As such, we examine written artifacts from the students' reflection activities for evidence of different epistemic games. We also describe a comparison of written artifacts to pre-post data from the FCI, MPEX, and CLASS surveys.

Advancements in technology have made electronic administration and grading of exams more prevalent. The staff of the Fundamentals of Engineering for Honors program at The Ohio State University recently began delivering a portion of each midterm and final exam via the university's online course management system. To assess whether changing to this style impacted student performance, a study was conducted to compare the two formats. For each exam in an introductory programming course, the computer-administered part of the test was split into an A half and a B half. Half of the students took part A on the computer and part B on paper, and vice/versa for the other half of the students. Additionally, students were asked a question about whether they had a preference for one format over the other. Results will be discussed, along with implications for the structure of future exams.

Energy is an abstract concept, but students and experts alike reason about energy using ontological metaphors: metaphors that indicate what kind of a thing energy is. These metaphors include energy as a substance ("This object has a lot of energy") and energy as a vertical location ("It dropped down to a lower energy"). Both of these metaphors can be productive, but each one has its limitations. In our previous work, we have shown that students and experts can productively combine the substance and location metaphors for energy and coordinate them coherently. Here, we examine instances in which students are using both metaphors, and argue that, in some cases, students blend these two separate metaphors into a single ontology for energy. To determine this, we employ an integrated methodology, analyzing both the verbal metaphors and the gestures that the students use.

Numerous studies indicate that spatial reasoning can play a role in STEM field success. Introductory university physics frequently requires students to construct integrals, a skill that may be influenced by spatial reasoning proficiency. We administered a straightforward physics problem requiring the construction of an integral to students enrolled in calculus-based introductory physics, and additionally measured their spatial reasoning ability using the Santa Barbara Solids Test. We found that the spatial reasoning score correlates moderately with overall performance on the integration task, as well as with various components of integral setup, such as correctly identifying cross-sectional area. Furthermore, we found that students who demonstrated a physical understanding of the integrand, via a simple multiple-choice question, were significantly more successful in constructing the integral, independent of spatial reasoning ability.These results suggest that, separately, both spatial reasoning and physical understanding of the integrand are important for constructing integrals in physics.

Assessment of problem-solving skills often poses some challenges in science programs. In particular, in large groups, for which several raters are involved, the question of the validity and reliability of the grading process can be legitimately challenged. A common approach to grading is to exploit a scoring scheme into which partial credits are attributed to distinct steps of the solution and points are deduced for errors. In the present work, two studies have been conducted to investigate whether the alternative use of rubrics may improve the grading process. The first was concerned with determining whether or not the rubrics developed for a class of freshman mechanics improve the scoring when compared to the traditional method. The second study used a revised version of the rubrics to verify the hypothesis that, with proper training, grading problem-solving using rubrics increases grading speed, agreement between graders and overall transparency of the grading process.

As part of an introductory physics course offered at Georgia Tech, students submit video reports on force and motion labs. Peer grading of reports provides the primary method for evaluating student laboratory work. During peer grading, students are guided to rate each others' videos on a rubric consisting of several likert-scale questions. They are also encouraged to provide written feedback explaining their grading for each rubric item. This paper explores how peer evaluations compare to instructors' evaluations by examining the likert-scale responses and written responses provide by both students and instructors. The written responses will be coded to understand what students and instructors attend to in their grading. Similarities and differences between student grading and expert grading will be discussed.

Improvements in student learning through interactive-engagement methods have been inconsistent over a range of institutions. Possible factors for these variations include institutional differences and instructor effectiveness. As part of a project to explore the key elements of successful algebra-based studio courses, we are conducting systematic observations and analyses of various classroom environments with regard to teaching methods, cognitive engagement, and instructor-student interactions. Our data are recorded as a chronological series of codes in the Teaching Dimensions Observational Protocol (TDOP) which reflect the classroom activities taking place at particular times. In order to test the efficacy of the TDOP computer-based tool, we are using an evidence-based approach for choosing an efficient set of codes grounded in PER. We will discuss the coding design process and our insights into studio-mode courses. We will outline the important factors impacting active learning in the classroom and discuss how the observations inform the broader study of successful studio physics.

Multiple-choice tests are commonly used in large introductoryphysics courses, but the format provides limited information about specific student weaknesses in problem solving. We seek to identify and characterize the role of physical process understanding in a multiple-choice format. To do this, we have written a collection of questions designed to assess students' understanding of the physical processes that occur in given scenarios. These questions were given to students in an introductory calculus-based mechanics course in a review context for each of the major examinations in the course. We have compared student performance on these questions to student performance in examinations and will discuss what these results reveal about this specific type of understanding in problem solving.

We have been investigating student understanding and application of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) in different physics contexts involving definite integrals. We conducted 14 semi-structured individual interviews with introductory physics students. Our analysis, using grounded theory, elicited various strategies to solve graphically based FTC problems. While many students struggled initially, at some point during the interviews students displayed the relevant and requisite mathematical knowledge, suggesting that they failed to access and/or apply the knowledge in the given physics contexts. Similar to prior studies on students dealing with mathematically based physics problems, we found the analysis perspectives of epistemological framing and epistemic games productive in interpreting some of the choices of strategies, the strategies themselves, and some individual steps observed. The framing perspective helps explain students' strategy-switching based on representations available or context familiarity. We discuss our findings and relate our results to those in the literature.

The physics department at Texas State University has implemented a Learning Assistant (LA) program with reform-based instructional changes in our introductory course sequences. We are interested in how participation in the program influences LAs' identity both as physics students and as physics teachers; in particular, how being part of the LA community changes participants' self-concepts and their day-to-day practice. We analyze written artifacts from program applications, reflections, evaluations, and group activities, as well as video of interviews with returning LAs. Our analysis suggests that engagement in the LA program increases LAs' sense of competence both in physics content and in the practice of engaging in the physics community. LAs change their perceptions of what constitutes competence: they learn to value and enjoy the practice of interactive, logical exploration and argumentation, which re-purposes being wrong (or saying wrong things) from a form of incompetence to an important component of competent engagement.

We are studying in how participation in the Learning Assistant program at Texas State University influences LAs' identity as physics students and physics teachers; in particular, how being part of the LA community changes participants' self-concepts and their day-to-day practice. Our analysis of self-concepts is informed by the identity framework developed by Hazari et al. [1, 2], and our analysis of practice is informed by Lave and Wenger's theory of Communities of Practice [3, 4]. We have developed a blended theory in order to analyze and explain LA program impact. We find that LAs expand their repertoire both of what they know how to do and of what they see as valuable in physics, consistent with Wenger's characterization of identity as community membership; and that recognition by faculty and peers supports LAs' continuing engagement, consistent with Wenger's characterization of identity as negotiated experience. We provide examples from our data.

A decade ago, web-based online homework was still somewhat of a novelty for many instructors; today it's a standard fixture in the introductory physics course. As online homework usage has grown, the ways in which students interact with this resource have changed.

In recent years there has been increased interest in understanding the ontological metaphors in play in experts' and novices' reasoning about energy.

We are investigating how experts and novices might (or might not) coordinate and/or blend these two metaphors when reasoning about energy. In this talk, we will focus on how to use gestures to understand such ontological blending.

Our research team has been engaged in the iterative redesign of an introductory physics course for life science (IPLS) majors to explicitly bridge biology and physics in ways that are authentic to the disciplines. In our efforts to transform the IPLS course, we draw on the work of others who have argued that high-quality science instruction recognizes, leverages, and cultivates the productive beginnings of scientific inquiry in students' science reasoning by engaging students in making sense of phenomena, building and refining models, and generating satisfying explanations. It is unclear however what this learning process should look like at the college level as students also build from and refine more formal disciplinary knowledge that they have developed across their academic careers. Reflecting on our successes and failures in developing this course, we will present our best articulation of what educators should attend to in designing such interdisciplinary courses.

Life science students crave coherence among the science courses that they are required to take, and are frustrated when these courses fail to talk to each other in meaningful ways. In an effort to bridge disciplinary divides, we have iteratively designed and implemented an Introductory Physics for Life Scientists (IPLS) course that aims to unpack the physical mechanisms underlying a number of authentic biological phenomena. We draw on case-study data to examine what it looks like for students in our course to make connections between fundamental physical principles and meaningful biological questions. In particular, we explore the multiple ways in which an explanation can be "mechanistic" in the context of interdisciplinary sense making, and the affective markers that indicate satisfactory explanation. We argue that achieving explanatory coherence in an IPLS course demands that we take up authentic biological phenomena for which highly detailed accounts are not practical.

We present the results of two surveys carried out on a "Physics for Humanities" class of about a hundred students. The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) is used to measure the shift in attitudes via a pre- and post-test carried out in the second installation of this class. Post-test data from the first installation of the course is also presented. The second survey is course specific and seeks to correlate aspects of the CLASS survey with student feedback about the pedagogical approaches used in the course. We seek to understand the efficacy of the various pedagogical tools used in achieving the learning goals. Further, the outcomes could potentially inform future versions of this class, and add to the data about physics courses for non-science majors.

Web-based computer simulations (sims) are widely used as teaching tools in the physics education community, though few controlled studies attest to if and how the sims actually contribute to learning. This paper describes a comprehensive experiment where several class sections of undergraduate students demonstrate highly significant achievement in mental model formation and long-term recall after working with sims. Four physics topics are targeted in a core undergraduate Physics I course at the U.S. Military Academy. Prominent student misconceptions in these topics are identified, and useful computer simulations for covering these topics are described in detail. The learning metrics of correct mental models and long-term recall are assessed quantitatively with a large control group, and qualitative student feedback is also provided. Possible causation of sims' success rate is explored and limitations of both this study, and sims' contribution to learning are noted.

The Test of Understanding Graphs in Kinematics (TUG-K) is a multiple-choice test developed by Beichner in 1994 to assess students' understanding of kinematics graphs. Many of the items on the TUG-K have strong distractor choices which correspond to students' common difficulties with kinematics graphs. We evaluate one aspect of the pedagogical content knowledge of first-year physics graduate students enrolled in a teaching assistant (TA) training course related to topics covered in the TUG-K. In particular, for each item on the TUG-K, the graduate students were asked to identify which incorrect answer choice they thought would be most commonly selected by introductory physics students if they did not know the correct answer after instruction in relevant concepts. We used the graduate student data and the data from Beichner's original paper for introductory physics students (which was collected from over 500 college and high-school students) to assess this aspect of the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of the graduate students, i.e., knowledge of student difficulties related to kinematics graphs as they are revealed by the TUG-K. We find that, although the graduate students, on average, performed better than random guessing at identifying introductory student difficulties on the TUG-K, they did not identify many common difficulties that introductory students have with graphs in kinematics. In addition, we find that the ability of graduate students to identify the difficulties of introductory students is context dependent and that discussions among the graduate students improved their understanding of student difficulties related to kinematics graphs. Moreover, we find that the ability of American graduate students in identifying common student difficulties is comparable with that of foreign graduate students.

We are developing and assessing a quantum interactive learning tutorial (QuILT) on Mach Zehnder Interferometry with single photons to expose students to contemporary applications of quantum mechanics. The QuILT strives to help students develop the ability to apply quantum principles in physical situations, explore differences between classical and quantum ideas, and organize knowledge hierarchically. The QuILT also helps students learn about delayed choice experiments, first proposed by John Wheeler. It adapts visualization tools to help students build physical intuition about non-intuitive quantum phenomena and focuses on helping them integrate qualitative and quantitative understanding and discriminate between concepts that are often confused. Details of the development and assessment will be discussed. We thank the National Science Foundation for support.

In recent years, science and particularly physics education has been furthered by the use of project-based interactive learning. There is a tremendous amount of evidence that use of these techniques in a college learning environment leads to a deeper appreciation and understanding of fundamental concepts. Since vectors are the basis for any advancement in physics and engineering courses the cornerstone of any physics regimen is a concrete and comprehensive introduction to vectors. Here, we introduce a new turn-based vector game that we have developed to help supplement traditional vector learning practices, which allows students to be creative, work together as a team, and accomplish a goal through the understanding of basic vector concepts. The results of student retention of concepts has increased dramatically, and engagement and time spent in lab have been amazingly increased. The disguise of the lesson and impact of a competitive game environment will be discussed.

A constant struggle for professors is getting students to read the textbook. This year, I piloted a reading companion called an Active Reading Document (ARD). The goal of the ARD is for students to condense the important information from a chapter into one clear, well organized document. The ARD consists of three parts: a visual representation (for example, a concept map) of the content and connections within the chapter, a list of important terms with original definitions, and a set of original connections from within the chapter, to previous chapters, to their own life. This presentation will introduce the concept of an ARD and discuss the successes and failures in a first attempt of implementation into a physics course.

We have implemented web-based computer coaches into small classes at University of Minnesota Rochester over the last three years. The varying usage of coaches by individual students outside of class allowed us to categorize them into different user groups. This presentation reports on a comparative study on examining if and how different user groups' attitude toward problem solving changes after the completion of an introductory-level physics course as measured by an attitude survey. The relationship between the use of the coaches and students' conceptual learning measured by a concept test will also be discussed. A consistent tendency has been found correlating the user groups with their course performance and gender. Likewise, time of completion of the coaches seems to correspond with individual student attitudes toward problem solving as well as conceptual learning.

Research has shown that using visual cues and correctness feedback can improve problem solving. In this study, we investigate the effect of self-explanations as well as visual cues and correctness feedback on conceptual physics tasks. Students enrolled in an introductory mechanics course were interviewed individually and asked to provide self-explanations on conceptual physics tasks. Participants worked through four sets of tasks, each containing a diagram. Each set contained an initial task, six isomorphic training tasks, a near transfer task, and a far transfer task. Students in the cued conditions saw visual cues on the training tasks, and students in the feedback conditions were told whether their responses were correct or incorrect. We discuss the influence of self-explanation on students' ability to solve the training and transfer task with respect to the cue and feedback conditions.

Included conceptions were collected both from prior studies involving subjects having a variety of ages, and from our own interviews and assessments given to college students.

Our previous study shows visual cueing with feedback can be very helpful to students in physics problem solving. Effective linguistic cueing is an obvious complement of visual cueing in computer-aided instruction. In this study, we focus on the effects of verbal cueing and the interaction between linguistic cueing and visual cueing on correctness of students' responses on conceptual physics tasks. Participants solved four sets of conceptual problems, each of them containing one initial problem, six training problems, one near transfer problem, and one far transfer problem. Their spoken answers were analyzed for their reasoning and correctness. Our study provided insights into the relationship between the modality of cueing and students' physics problem solving performance. *This research is supported in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grants 1138697 and 1348857.

Potential energy is a conceptually rich topic presenting many difficulties for students. One key feature of potential energy is that it is a function of the distance between interacting objects. This concept is relevant to understanding potential energy in both physical and chemical contexts. Data from student responses to written surveys and small-group interviews reveal that students do not spontaneously make connections between ideas they have about energy from physics classes and the ideas necessary for an understanding of energy in chemical contexts, but that they can be guided to draw these connections with appropriate scaffolding. In this talk, I will describe research into the levels of scaffolding that are necessary and sufficient to aid students in drawing connections between energy concepts across the disciplines.

The Quantum Mechanics Concept Assessment (QMCA) is a 31-item multiple choice (MC) concept assessment instrument for first semester upper-division quantum mechanics. The process of developing this tool started with converting a preliminary version of an existing 14-item open-ended test to a MC format. During two years of testing and refinement, the QMCA has been given in alpha (N=61) and beta versions (N=263) to students in upper division quantum mechanics courses at 11 different institutions with average posttest score of 54%. In this talk, we will discuss the construction process of effective distractors and the use of student interviews and expert feedback to revise and validate both questions and distractors. We will also discuss the results of common statistical tests of reliability and validity, which suggest the instrument is presently in a stable, usable, and promising form.

Data that measures group learning are time-consuming to collect and analyze on a large scale. As an initial step toward scaling qualitative classroom observation, our team qualitatively coded classroom video using an established coding scheme with and without its audio. We find that inter-rater reliability is as high when using visual data only "without audio" as when using both visual and audio data to code. Also, inter-rater reliability is high even when comparing use of visual and audio data to visual-only data. We see a small bias that interactions are more often coded as group discussion when visual and audio data are used compared with video-only data. This work establishes that meaningful educational observation can be made through visual information alone. Further, after initial work from qualitative researchers validates the coding scheme in each classroom environment, computer-automated visual coding could drastically increase the breadth of qualitative studies and provide meaningful educational assessment to a large number of classrooms.

Student attitudes about learning and understanding physics have been shown to be nave and remarkably stable, failing to become more expert-like even after instruction informed by PER. This talk describes the efforts of one community college faculty member, already committed to and experienced with student-centered methods, to integrate explicit instruction in metacognition into her teaching of the introductory mechanics course. Students had weekly practice reflecting in writing on changes in their own thinking, supported by frequent full-class discussion in which this type of metacognition was modeled and framed. The sophistication of student attitudes about the role of reflection in their learning was tracked through an end-of-course learning commentary assignment. Preliminary analysis indicates substantial positive changes in attitudes as compared to results from sections of the course in which metacognition was not explicitly taught. The instruction will be briefly described, and data from multiple sections of the course will be shared. This work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. DUE-1245999, DUE- 1245993, DUE-1245313 and DUE-1245699.

How People Learn summarized decades of research on learning and included metacognition as one of its Three Key Findings. Active self-monitoring characterizes expert learning, and HPL advocates the explicit teaching of monitoring strategies in context. But how accurately can students identify specific changes in their understanding? As part of a collaborative effort at WWU, WCC, NDSU, and U. Maine, we have examined student metacognition using paired questions. This talk presents results from a mechanics question administered at the beginning of instruction in a course for preservice elementary teachers, and again two weeks later toward the end of relevant instruction. The re-assessment included a prompt asking students to describe how their thinking had changed. Researchers coded responses on the initial assessment and re-assessment for content accuracy, and then compared differences in these codes to the students' self-reported descriptions of changes in their thinking. This work partially supported by NSF Grant Nos. DUE-1245999, DUE-1245993, DUE-1245313 and DUE-1245699.

Many universities have created programs to support undergraduate retention by placing students in research positions. I will present research on first-year undergraduate students' evolving ideas about physics research. Students in the study were part of a research seminar at the University of Maryland in which they worked with research mentors on research projects. Class time was dedicated to teaching research skills and supporting students through emotional hurdles associated with research. In classroom video and interviews, students described ways in which their research experiences were different from their expectations. Students tie an improved sense of competence in research to a better understanding of who does physics and how physics research works.

Recent publications have indicated that there is a link between students' performance and students' beliefs in whether intelligence is fixed or capable of growth. They also argue that these beliefs can be changed by simple interventions. In this talk, we will provide pre- and post-course evaluations of students' beliefs on intelligence using the Implicit Theory of Intelligence Scale (ITIS) for both an experimental and a control class. The experimental class had both a brief written and oral intervention. We will also show correlations between students' beliefs on intelligence and their success in the course.

As part of an ongoing project aimed at improving student learning by investigating and supporting student metacognitive abilities in the context of physics, we have been examining the role of metacognition in the kind of qualitative, inferential reasoning emphasized in research-based instructional materials. In particular, we have been using paired question sequences shown to elicit inconsistencies in student reasoning as the basis for a think-aloud interview protocol in which pairs of students collaboratively work through such question sequences. Audio, video, and real-time writing data have been used to identify instances of socially mediated metacognition. This talk will focus on targeted interventions in which student pairs are guided to reflect on multiple samples of authentic student work after the pairs have completed the problems collaboratively. Preliminary findings will be presented. This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. DUE-1245313, DUE-1245999, and DUE-0962805.

At our institution, all freshmen are required to take a multidisciplinary course taught by three faculty members from different departments. Anecdotally, faculty members have long discussed the variations in student perceptions of the disciplines and how they are manifested in this context. This study presents pre- and post-data gathered from one such interdisciplinary class to determine whether there are measurable differences in the way students view natural science, social science, and humanities.

The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program was initially authorized in 2002. SUNY Buffalo State initially received Noyce funding in 2004. There have been approximately 40 scholars in Phase 1 and 26 scholars in Phase 2. Fifteen of these scholars were physics concentrations. Of these 15, four scholars are currently teaching physics or physical science in New York state. Another six scholars are currently in education, but not necessarily teaching physics or are not in the New York area. Of the remaining scholars, two have not yet completed the program. The selected Noyce physics scholars were observed, in the spring of 2015 semester, using the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP). Each scholar was observed several times; the observations were pre-arranged with paired observers. The resulting scores, with sub-scores, will be reported along with inter-rater reliability data. This data is a sub-set of a larger study of Noyce Scholars at Buffalo State.

The American Physical Society released a 2014 statement calling on all university physics and astronomy departments to provide all undergraduate students with access to research experiences. In response to this call, we investigated the current status of access to undergraduate research at CU-Boulder, a large research institution where the number of undergraduate physics majors outnumber faculty by more than five to one. We created and administered two surveys within CU-Boulders Physics Department: one probed undergraduate students familiarity with and participation in research; the other probed faculty members experiences mentoring undergraduate researchers. We present results from these surveys about access to undergraduate research within CU-Boulders Physics Department.

Faculty professional development (PD) workshops are a primary mechanism used to increase the adoption and adaptation of research-based instructional strategies (RBIS). PD workshops draw in many physics and astronomy instructors and serve a critical role in changing instructional practices within our community. Our research focuses on two of the largest and longest-running workshops for faculty: the New Physics and Astronomy Faculty Workshop and the Center for Astronomy Education Teaching Excellence Workshop. We are developing a real-time professional development observation tool to document what happens during workshops. We reveal opportunities to improve these PD efforts through increased awareness of instructors experiences and prior knowledge. We assume that all instructors have some pedagogical ideas that align with education research results, their productive resources. We analyze interviews to demonstrate the nature of these resources and consider how different PD practices create different opportunities for instructors resources to be built on.

Courses in science/engineering ethics as well as research on students' developing sense of ethics often emphasize the micro-ethics of research, mentoring, and publications. Little research or instruction focuses on how future scientists/engineers understand the social, ethical, environmental, economic, and political impact of their scientific and technological contributions. Towards addressing this gap in literature, we are creating case-study accounts of how future scientists/engineers think about their responsibility towards the social impact of their contribution. The case studies draw from video-taped semi-structured interviews. Our preliminary analysis suggests that how some students construe a scientist's/engineer's responsibility depends not just on rationalistic moral reasoning and personal experiences, but on the particular issue at hand (weaponized drones versus bridges, for example), on their sense of self as a future engineer, views about what is engineering, sense of nationality, emotions, targets of empathy, and ideologies/narratives available to them through participation in the world at large.

TLE TeachLivE is a mixed-reality classroom that allows participants (typically K-12 pre-service or in-service teachers) to practice teaching with simulated students. Similar to a flight simulator for pilots, TeachLivE allows teachers to refine their skills without risk to real students, and to practice the same skills in the same instructional context several times. Here, we describe the use of TeachLive with a class of physics Learning Assistants (LAs). Each LA led a short discussion in the mixed-reality class, observed the other LAs lead discussions, and reflected with their teammates about the experience. After reflection, each LA re-taught the same discussion. Finally, LAs were asked to write about what they learned from their experience. We will focus on changes in their use of certain pedagogical skills, such as questioning, from their first to second interaction with the simulator as well as their reactions to the experiences.

The CSU S-STEM Program supported by the National Science Foundation seeks to increase the educational attainment of CSU students and encourage more students to think of themselves as scientists. Chemistry and physics majors in the S-STEM Program receive tuition support at CSU, engage in a summer program based on the University of California-Berkeley Compass Project, participate in early research experiences during their first year at CSU, and engage in a peer and faculty mentoring program. Students also receive funding to support travel to attend conferences and present research and explore graduate programs, teaching careers, and careers in scientific research. An emphasis on the development of community, in addition to academic and scientific support, are essential elements of the CSU S-STEM Program and build on the resources of our students who mainly come from neighborhoods on the southside of Chicago.

This presentation gives an overview of findings from the first four years of running a Learning Assistant (LA) program[1] at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). At UMCP, LAs have supported educational transformation efforts across 12 different science courses and engaged 22 different instructors in research-based educational practices. In assessing the impact of this program on LAs, we have replicated CU-Boulders finding that LAs conceptual understanding is improved through participation in the LA program (~10% average absolute gain on FMCE[2]) [3]. We are investigating the longitudinal impacts of the LA experience on LAs and how LA programs may be cultivating change agents. We find that many of our former LAs continue to be involved in some teaching and work to change how learning environments are structured. LAs also report that their experiences in the program were transformative for the ways that they thought about teaching and learning science.

FIU has implemented a three-pronged retention approach that aims to create connections between typically isolated PER-driven reformed elements namely, a Bridge summer program, reformed introductory STEM classes and the Learning Assistant Program. We identify impacts of the summer Bridge program on student performance, retention rate, academic progress and performance in mathematics courses by comparing to a similar group of FTIC (First-time-in-college) engineering freshmen who havent participated in the program. Bridge students had higher retention rates than all other FTIC Engineering students, higher average cumulative credit counts and GPA, and outperformed all other engineering students as determined by their overall GPA in their mathematics courses. While this effect is substantial, Propensity Score Genetic Matching shows no effect on cumulative GPA when covariates such as high school GPA and SAT Math scores are included in the matched group of non-participants. We discuss these results in light of the involvement of the cohorts in the other reformed efforts.

The physics department at Texas State University has had a Learning Assistant (LA) program in place for three years, supporting reform-based instructional changes in all sections of our introductory course sequence for majors. We are interested in how participation in the LA program influences LAs identity as physics students and instructors; we have previously reported trends in increased community involvement and a shift in experienced LAs concepts of what it means to be competent. Our interview data now include first-semester LAs, and we see a significant difference in physics identity development between these LAs and those with more experience. During their first semester, LAs seem to experience a state of unease with respect to teaching and learning. We explain this discomfort in terms of Piagetian disequilibrium around their conceptions of competence in teaching and learning, and examine evidence of their (re-)construction of identities of competence.

Research has shown that an Interactive-Learning-Environment (ILE) can be an effective learning environment for acquiring transferrable knowledge. Our research analyzed characteristics of students participation in an ILE and their teamwork learning ability, in different areas of two consecutive interactive learning physics classes that implemented the Investigative-Science-Learning-Environment (ISLE) curriculuma type of widely used ILE. We quantified students participation in two broad areas: in-class learning activities and class review sessions. To analyze teamwork learning ability, we gave students six problems to be solved in groups (group exams), using physics they had not yet learned. We then gave them six standard physics problems related to the group exams to solve individually. Our results show that the frequency with which students participate in on topic physics discussions while engaged in learning activities is only weakly associated with learning, but being off-topic and disengaged has a consistently significant negative relationship with learning and transfer.

Our research team, composed of four high school physics teachers and two pre-service teachers, believe scientific induction is valuable and critical to student learning. We are exploring at what point in the learning cycle students gain ideas that align with those of the scientific community, i.e. scientific principles. Eight high school physics teachers piloting the Physics and Everyday Thinking (PET) curriculum collected data about student ideas using short diagnostic assessments. These were administered at three points during the learning cycle: before students shared initial predictions, after students conducted laboratory activities, and after students engaged in whole class discussions and readings about the scientific principles. We will present initial findings about student learning gains during induction-type activities. Further analysis will help us capitalize on students content understanding gains during the PET learning cycle and allow us to tailor future lessons so our instructional moves leverage that portion of the lesson.

We developed and implemented a set of online essential skills tasks to help students achieve and retain a core level of mastery and fluency in basic skills necessary for their coursework. The task design is based on our research on student understanding and difficulties as well as three well-established cognitive principles: 1) spaced practice, to promote retention, 2) interleaved practice, to promote the ability to recognize when the learned skill is needed, and 3) mastery practice mastery practice, to promote a base level of performance. We report on training on a variety of skills with vector math. Students spent a relatively small amount of time, 10-20 minutes in practice each week, answering relevant questions online until a mastery level was achieved. Results indicate significant and often dramatic gains, with retention at least several weeks after the final practice session, including for less-prepared students.

Force, velocity, and acceleration represent an interesting set of physics concepts in that they are foundational and a persistent source of student difficulty even after instruction. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of different question formats combined with immediate feedback in training on this set of concepts, we have compared computer-based practice with natural language and multiple choice question formats for two different populations of introductory physics students. In addition to comparisons of student progress through the training, student performance is analyzed based on their responses to a previously validated force and motion assessment. Results from an introductory physics course (first semester mechanics) suggest that natural language format questions may provide advantages over their multiple choice counterparts. However, subsequent results in a different introductory physics course (second semester electromagnetism) show that this finding may only be true for less-prepared students and that further replication is necessary.

Microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) formats in non-traditional settings allow us to vary the timing of laboratory-type experiences within the course design. We have used a clinical study to investigate the role of MBL experiences, using the IOLab system, as a tool to introduce new physics topics to students. In the study, college students with little to no physics background were given both passive and active online MBL instruction in varying order. We will discuss the effects of the format and order of instruction on student conceptual learning and retention, as well as the implications of these results for future course design.

Educational Data Mining (EDM) is the process of finding learning patterns and to predict some results that can materialize in the learning procedure. These data can be engendered from students through evaluation tests, virtual or physical activities, and homework corresponding to most of the activities that students have to make out with their respective instructional design. In the present work we show the effects of applying EDM algorithms from the results obtaining of two active-learning experiments designed ad-hoc for the learning of Basic Electric Circuits Concepts in High School students. We examined the effects of using simulations as one active-learning methodology and the use of low-cost experiments in the classroom as the second active-learning methodology this let us to compare the effects of the learning sequences in each methodology and with the results we can re-design the learning sequence and adapting the best exercises of each instructional design.

Preliminary data will be presented that suggests that PBL methodologies in physics do in fact spur growth in these areas. Further evidence gathered from student reflections will be presented that support and validate this claim.

In our preparatory kinematics and dynamics course of about 500 students, we replaced traditional immediate feedback homework with mastery-style homework. This mastery mode required students to perfect a set of questions before moving on to the next level of increased difficulty, and implemented narrated animated solutions to provide instructional support, if necessary. Results, including class performance compared to previous years students and student behaviors, will be discussed.

Mastery style activities that included narrated animated solutions for instructional support were compared with immediate feedback activities similar to most online homework. In a clinical study, the mastery group attempted question sets in four levels, with animated solutions between each attempt, until mastery was achieved on each level. This combined elements of formative assessment, the worked example effect, and mastery learning. The homework group attempted questions with immediate feedback and unlimited tries. The two groups took a similar amount of time to complete the activity. The mastery group significantly outperformed the homework group on a free response post-test that required students to show their work in solving near and far transfer problems.

Throughout the past three years, Elaborative Interrogation, which has students read a passage from the text and respond to the prompt Why is this true? for a sentence from the passage, has been employed in an introductory algebra-based physics course at a large Northeastern university. Students in the course were asked to complete elaborative interrogation questions based on assigned readings as part of their homework each week. In this talk we will present data collected during this intervention that show a relation between student performance and improvement on the elaborative interrogation questions and their course exam scores. We will also discuss data from cognitive interviews conducted as students were responding to the interrogation questions that provide insights into what the students are doing as they are reading the text and answering the questions.

In recent years a number of online platforms have been developed to facilitate the creation of student-generated course content. One widely used system is PeerWise, which provides a space where students can create and share multiple-choice questions; answer and rate other students questions; and engage in discussion with their peers. These types of activities have long been recognized as being effective in increasing students engagement and enhancing the development of knowledge and understanding, critical thinking, and problem solving skills. As part of a wider study across courses in physics, chemistry, and biology, we present findings from a multi-year study of PeerWise use in early-years undergraduate physics courses. In the majority of courses there is a positive relationship between engaging with PeerWise and end of course exam performance, even when taking into account other influences on performance, such as students prior ability.

On the basis of our analysis of responses to written questions administered to large numbers of introductory physics students at several universities across the United States, we report the specific, recurring conceptual resources that students use to reason about energy. This work responds to a need for large-scale, resources-grounded research on students conceptual understanding and supports the development of an underexplored dimension of pedagogical content knowledge knowledge of student resources for understanding energy, in contrast to misconceptions or misunderstandings about energy. We aim to promote instructor take-up of the resources theory of knowledge, and we suggest a number of ways in which instructors might capitalize on the resources we report.

In this study, students ability to draw inferences from graphs was explored. Approximately 300 students, in either the first or second semester of an introductory, calculus-based physics course, were given simple two-dimensional graphs and asked to draw inferences about the relationship between the dependent variable and each of three independent variables shown in the graph. The common strategies students employed and the pitfalls they encountered in doing this were observed. Additionally, the effect of students prior belief on their ability to draw valid inferences was assessed by presenting graphs either in a familiar physical context or in a more generic context. We found students were generally able to read simple graphs; however, their ability was affected by the consistency of their prior beliefs with the data, their numeric ability, and the complexity of the graph. These results are consistent with previous studies done with data tables.

The DEAR-Faculty project is a large, international, multi-methods study to investigate student learning in introductory physics. As part of this project, we conduct meta-analyses of published data using popular research-based conceptual assessments such as the Force Concept Inventory (FCI). In this talk, I present a meta-analysis of student learning in electricity and magnetism. We concatenated data from a comprehensive literature search of papers published in PhysRevST-PER, AJP, and the PERC proceedings, and/or indexed in ERIC, Scopus, or Web of Science. We selected all primary studies that present sufficient data on the two most popular EM assessments: the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM), and the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment (BEMA). Our data set includes 50 studies representing about 60 schools. We calculated the effects of institution and teaching methods on student learning, as well as some overall statistics on the heterogeneity of the data set.

Energy is a topic that spans the scientific disciplines. Many studies conducted within the domains of both physics and chemistry demonstrate that potential energy in particular is a difficult topic for students. Previous work has shown that even within physics, students do not necessarily draw on ideas from mechanics when answering questions about potential energy in the context of electrostatics. We have been engaged in a research project aimed at helping students to make productive use of their ideas about gravitational potential energy when asked questions in the context of electrostatics. In this talk, we will report on recent findings regarding what helps students to draw these connections. We will present data from small-group interviews and online surveys, and we will discuss the implications these data have for instruction on energy in introductory courses.

Learning quantum mechanics requires students to develop not only new mathematical skills but also conceptual understanding. Towards this instructional goal, the Modern Physics for Engineers course at the University of Colorado Boulder explicitly addresses interpretation of quantum phenomena. Research indicates that when instruction does not explicitly address student beliefs about the nature of a subject, the students ideas tend to become less expert-like (Atman, et al., 2007). We present new data from focus groups of students enrolled in this course. During recorded discussions, they negotiate the tension between reasoning about light in terms of classical (wave-like) and quantum (particle-like) ontologies. We examine transitions in students ontological reasoning about light as well as their use of energy as a bridge between classical and quantum ideas. Finally, we consider fostering students' metacognitive awareness as a route to expert-like behaviors in quantum mechanics.

The abstract nature of energy encourages the use of metaphorical language in educational settings. K-12 teachers and students use conceptual metaphors implicitly to express their ideas about what energy is or how it functions in particular scenarios. Attending to the use of conceptual metaphors in the classroom can expand teachers repertoire for formative assessment of student ideas. Yet science education research on analogies and metaphors has predominately focused on explicit, instructional analogies, rather than attending to such implicit, ubiquitous features of natural language in science. In a secondary science teacher professional development course, we observe teachers engage in an instructional activity designed to increase awareness of conceptual metaphor in everyday language and in descriptions of energy. These teachers come to value the application of conceptual metaphor in educational settings; they acknowledge that if they identify metaphors present in their students science language, they will better understand their students ideas about energy. We present possible mechanisms for teacher growth in learning and valuing the use of energy metaphors and illustrate how to support teachers in noticing, understanding, and valuing metaphors for energy.

Often in environments where students are collaboratively working on physics problems, students need to manage social conflict alongside grappling with conceptual and epistemological differences. At the University of Maryland, our PER group has been developing QM tutorials to help students more carefully navigate between classical and quantum models. In this presentation, we document several outlets that students use as tools for social framing and managing social conflict. These resources include epistemic distancing, humor, playing on tutorial wording and looking ahead to subsequent questions. Our data come from video-records of a focus group at the University of Maryland, where students work through a tutorial on the Particle in a Box. We see evidence of students using mathematics in ways that may normally be interpreted as indicating an epistemological stance, but are actually used as a means of defusing social tension.

Introductory university physics frequently involves the construction of integrals. There is evidence to suggest that a major obstacle to student success in the construction of physics integrals is an inability to formulate and interpret differentials and products involving differentials. We provided introductory calculus-based physics students with several physics problems featuring infinitesimal quantities in a variety of contexts in order to identify potential misconceptions regarding physical differentials. Our results demonstrated several broad, recurring student difficulties. To address these issues, we conducted a controlled experiment at the introductory level to help students practice the construction and explore the physical meaning of differentials. This between-students design featured pairs of similarly-styled training tasks that varied by physical context, either on paper without feedback or on a computer with electronic feedback. A post-test was given to all conditions. We will discuss and analyze the results of these studies.

In a study on student understanding of graphical representations of work, students in introductory calculus-based physics were presented with a force-position graph (F-x) that showed two different mechanical processes with identical initial and identical final values for force and position. The task, to compare the works done in each case, was administered at three points along the two-semester instructional sequence to probe differences in student responses and reasoning and compare findings to results from analogous questions in thermodynamics. Response prevalence varied little across administrations; however, the reasoning students used showed variation. Analysis of reasoning used showed a higher use of area under the curve for a correct response, and a more prevalent invocation of path independence or conservative forces for the major incorrect interpretation, with instruction. These findings support earlier speculation that thermodynamics students associate work with conservative forces due to introductory instruction.

As part of a larger project at the University of Maine to investigate the learning and teaching of concepts in thermodynamics and electronics that are integral to both undergraduate physics and engineering programs, we have been examining student learning in electrical engineering and physics courses on electric circuits and electronics. A major goal of this work at the physics-engineering interface is to probe the extent to which the nature of student understanding (including the prevalence of specific difficulties) depends upon the disciplinary context. In this talk, I will focus on our efforts to probe student understanding of basic diode circuits using free-response questions. Preliminary results from questions administered in both physics and engineering courses will be presented.

Through a classroom study, we investigated whether student attempts to invent general physics principles support both discovery and future learning of those principles. In introductory physics discussion sections, small groups of students used a PhET simulation to connect ideas from topographic contour maps to electric equipotential lines for two sample charge configurations. The goal was for students to find the relationship between the electric field and the equipotential lines. On a conceptual survey administered immediately after this activity, students directed to create general rules performed better than students led through case-by-case predictions. This differential was maintained some days later, after both groups had received instruction in lecture and lab on the topic. This indicates that the task of explicit generalization not only supports discovery of general physics principles, but also prepares students for improved future learning from instruction.

Developing physical intuition about quantum mechanics can seem like a departure from our everyday experience of the physical world, but we build new ideas from our existing ones. In this presentation we examine video data from a focus group doing a tutorial about the particle in a box. In reasoning about the properties of a quantum particle, the students bring in elements of a classical particle ontology, which are evident not only through the students language but through their use of gestures. But this is modulated by metacognitive moments in which the group explicitly takes up questions of whether classical intuitions are valid for the quantum system. Through this reflection, the students find some cases in which classical ideas can be usefully applied to quantum physics, and others in which they directly contrast classical and quantum mechanics. Negotiating this boundary is part of the process of building quantum intuitions.

A significant goal of STEM education research has been to understand how students solve problems. An important aspect of students approaches to problem solving is their epistemologies, or beliefs about knowledge. In this study, students in a calculus-based, introductory physics course were presented with a problem on a test that asked them to find the mass of a simple pendulum given its equation of motion. Later, students were asked to write a short reflection on their problem-solving strategies and feelings as they wrestled with the problem. Understandably, students were frustrated by their inability to obtain a numerical answer. Reflections and test answers give insight into the students beliefs about the complexity and source of knowledge. Results show that most students relied heavily on their equation sheets. However, frustration with that method led some to progress to other considerations including lab experiences and their own conceptual understanding.

Visual cues have been shown to direct attention to relevant areas of a diagram and facilitate problem solving. We investigate the effect of visual cues on students visual attention while solving conceptual physics problems with diagrams. The diagrams contained features relevant to correctly solving the problem, as well as features attributed to common incorrect answers. Students enrolled in an introductory mechanics course were individually interviewed using a think-aloud protocol while their eye movements were recorded. Participants worked through four sets of problems containing an initial problem, four isomorphic training problems, and two transfer problems. Students in the cued condition saw visual cues overlaid on the training problems. A second interview was conducted two weeks later, in which students solved the two transfer problems without cues. We compare the cued and non-cued groups with respect to the automaticity of extracting relevant information on the transfer and retention problems.

We present the preliminary results of a study of student use of representations in problem solving within the Modeling Instruction Electricity and Magnetism (MI-EM) course. Representational competence is a critical skill needed for students to develop a sophisticated understanding of and success in college science topics. In this study, 70 students were given a survey of 25 physics problem statements both pre- and post- instruction, covering both Newtonian Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism (EM), and asked which representations they would use in that given situation. We analyze the results by comparing the preponderance of these representations. We also compare student representation use for those who had already taken the first-semester Modeling Instruction Mechanics course and those students who had taken a non-Modeling Mechanics course. In addition, we look at how students representation use changed by context of problem (Mechanics vs. EM).

To create valuable hints in computer-assisted instruction for physics problems involving graphs and figures, the effect of hint modalities needs to be tested on students performance and visual attention. Participants in our study solved four sets of conceptual problems, each of them containing one initial problem, six training problems, one near transfer problem, and one far transfer problem. The data showed that the same content in different modalities alters the effectiveness of the hint. Students eye movement data has also been explored to give insight into how hint modality changes students visual attention and how multiple hint modalities interact with each other. The results of this study could shed light on generating new principles to guide construction of computer-based physics problem solving instruction.

Visual cueing is shown to be effective in helping students solve conceptual physics tasks. However, students may have difficulties in solving physics transfer tasks with different surface features. We investigated if instruction provided using videos that contain explanations to the tasks that will improve students performance in solving near and far tasks. We interviewed students using a think-aloud protocol. Each interview included four sets of tasks. In each set students need to solve one initial problem, four isomorphic training tasks, a near transfer task, and a far transfer task. Based on the conditions, some of the students were provided with visual cues when solving training tasks, and some of them were provided with an instructional video following the training session. We compare students reasoning patterns and correctness in the two conditions.

Previous studies have shown that visual cues can help students to shift their attention toward relevant features of the conceptual physics problems in graph representation. However cueing does not completely prohibit students from attending to irrelevant features of a problem. In this study with students in an algebra-based class, we investigated the role of cues based on Wickens proximity compatibility principle that enabled us to adapt cues to particular kinds of questions. This principle states that there is a competition between the proximity of display features and proximity between the information in the mental state of the participants. Further, based on the Gestalt laws of grouping, we manipulated the display design to investigate the influence of the display proximity on the organization of the students attention toward the relevant parts of a problem and how that affects their response time.

Improving students skills in solving synthesis problems, which are problems requiring the application of multiple concepts such as energy conservation and kinematics, is typically a key instructional goal. We have previously found that students struggle with synthesis problems more than their single-concept counterparts in part because of difficulty recognizing all the relevant concepts or that multiple concepts are needed. Here we report on an experiment designed to test the effects of different types of hints on helping students apply the necessary concepts in solving a problem combining energy conservation and centripetal acceleration. While we found no statistically significant differences between the effects of different hints, we discuss trends suggesting that discouraging common incorrect solution paths may be more effective than highlighting underused components of a correct solution.

The study explores the effects of incrementing the mathematical complexity of a synthesis problem on students ability to recognize the relevant concepts and appropriately apply the identified concepts. The task highlights the situation of a block propelled from a spring on an inclined ramp. It undergoes projectile motion and lands on another inclined surface. Three versions of the task with different mathematical complexity were designed, requesting for the horizontal distance traveled by the block, spring compression, and projection angle respectively. A cohort of 105 physics students in three groups completed one version of the problem. Across the three tasks, more than a half of the sample succeeded in recognizing the appropriate concepts and committed to using solely the identified concepts. However, regardless of the mathematical complexity level, the majority of the students failed to correctly apply the physics concepts, with the occurrence of similar types of conceptual mistakes.

Troubleshooting activities engage students in diagnosing/explaining embedded mistakes in teacher-made erroneous solutions for physics problems. We hypothesized that students engaged in troubleshooting activities (aided by principle-based prompts and sample diagnoses when reviewing their own diagnoses) would outperform students engaged in problem-solving activities (aided by sample solutions when reviewing their own solutions) in their preparation for future learning: understanding of the concepts required to solve these problems, as well as inclination to self-repair one's understanding when reviewing his/her work. We will describe the findings of a comparison between two groups of 10th graders from the Arab sector in Israel, one performing troubleshooting activities and the other problem-solving activities in the context of geometrical optics. We will present an analysis of students' articulations that manifest self-repair when reviewing their own work, aided by instructors' diagnosis of an erroneous solution as well as analysis of their performance on transfer problems.

Students' performance before and after the interventions were examined using the double transfer methodology: Solving a transfer problem after studying a learning resource: instructors' diagnosis and correction of an erroneous solution to an isomorphic problem.

As physics instructors, we often scaffold problem solving by prompting students with a series of intermediate steps. The consequences, good or bad, of such scaffolding are often left uninvestigated. We report on results of a study partially replicating and extending research by Heckler (2009) in which we asked undergraduate students to solve Newtons laws problems. Half of the students were prompted to draw a force diagram before finding a solution. We found that the diagram prompt drove students away from an intuitive strategy, toward more lengthy formal strategies with lower success rates. In another measure, students were more likely to find fault with the informal nature of an intuitive solution if the problem statement included a diagram prompt. These results suggest that such problem-solving scaffolding affects students solution approach, possibly by cuing different epistemological stances on what counts as a good answer.

Well-designed instructional simulations in the classroom can help students learn difficult concepts in an enjoyable way. The University of Colorado PhET simulations are some of the most widely used (15 million runs every year). We are investigating students' reasoning when working collaboratively on PhET simulations scaffolded by tutorial worksheets. We have developed a tutorial for the Gas Properties simulation for introductory physics students designed to solicit mechanistic reasoning about temperature and pressure in terms of molecular motion. However, in clinical and classroom settings, students working collaboratively on the tutorial used the ideal gas law to make predictions about situations in which an ideal gas is being compressed or heated and subsequently used the simulation to confirm their predictions. Many groups did not engage in discussing the temperature, pressure or work done in terms of the molecular motion. These results informed subsequent modifications. We will present preliminary results of our investigations.

As part of a larger study on physics identity development, we have observed that students link their academic achievements and social interactions in physics to their sense of belonging in physics. For students who identify with underrepresented groups in physics, stereotype threats can be a significant obstacle to feeling like a physicist because students belong to multiple communities with identities that are often at odds with one another. As representatives of their community, these students have to deal with the added worry of confirming the stereotypes about their group. For example, female majors may feel that they have to prove that women arent bad at math. Through interviews with upper-division physics majors, we examined coping strategies to deal with stereotype threat in a variety of settings. Our findings suggest that peers and mentors can play unexpected roles in helping students manage stereotype threat and succeed in becoming physicists.

Swarthmore College life science students take a traditional first semester physics course, but have the option of taking an innovative Introductory Physics for the Life Sciences (IPLS) course in the second semester. This curricular structure presents a unique opportunity to compare students experiences across these different instructional environments. We have used multiple conceptual and attitudinal survey instruments, and have interviewed a number of students over the course of the year, in an effort to assess students evolving relationship with physics across these two different experiences. In this talk we present some of our findings from these survey and interview data, comparing epistemological and affective features of students experiences across the traditional and IPLS environments. This comparison allows us to identify some of the features that students find especially engaging about the IPLS course in particular.

Effectively teaching an Introductory Physics for the Life Sciences (IPLS) course means engaging life science students in a subject for which they may not have considerable preexisting interest. We have found that the inclusion of authentic life science examples supports students whose initial interest in physics is less developed, but that different examples and models vary in their effectiveness at engaging student interest. In this talk we begin to unpack this variability, exploring why some life science examples may be more successful than others at sparking and sustaining student interest. By analyzing data from (1) survey instruments assessing student interest in particular life science examples, and (2) interviews conducted with students before and after instruction, we identify features of our IPLS course that appear to be particularly important for fostering student engagement. We suggest that some of these features might also foster student interest in more traditional introductory physics courses.

While many instructors are interested in implementing student-centered practices in their classroom, few have access to data from their classroom to make informed instructional decisions. Our research team has developed the Student Participation Observation Tool (SPOT), an innovative web-based application, developed based on observable classroom actions aligned with research-based instructional practices. Using the SPOT, observers collect observational data that can be used by instructors to identify desirable classroom interaction sequences as well as illuminate areas for possible improvement. Armed with data, instructors are able to make informed decisions about their teaching practice and implement desired changes aligned with research-based best practices. This presentation describes the methods used to identify research about best practices in teaching as well as the process of distilling the observable actions and modes of engagement included in SPOT. We will also discuss how session participants can access the SPOT in order to try it out.

Undergraduate research has been recognized as a significant way to facilitate undergraduate students more central participation in physics. In this talk, I will present a potential mechanism by which research experiences may impact undergraduate participation: changes in their beliefs about the nature of science coupled to changes in a sense of ability to contribute to authentic research. Students in the study were part of a research seminar at the University of Maryland in which they worked with faculty and graduate student research mentors on research projects. Class time was dedicated to developing research skills and supporting students through emotional hurdles associated with research. In videotaped interviews, we asked students to describe their experiences in research. Students developed nuanced views about how the research process works. They also perceive shifts in their sense of access to research, feeling like their contributions as novices mattered.

Educational psychology studies have linked self-belief constructs to success in STEM, including self-efficacy (the belief in ones ability to succeed at specific tasks) and growth mindset (seeing intelligence as something that can be developed through dedication and effort). However, most of the work with these constructs uses traditional psychology large-N quantitative studies that show that change happens without describing in qualitative detail the mechanism by which it happens. This presentation will focus on a likely place for students to have a self-efficacy and growth mindset building experience: an in-depth course project that students complete in conjunction with introductory physics. We present evidence of students who see themselves as competent in neuroscience or genetics, who identify as people who embrace challenge, but who still place physics in a category of special difficulty. We then explore how this overlapping interests project creates opportunities to impact self-efficacy and growth mindset in physics.

Psychological research about human memory has shown the effectiveness of spaced recall.(1) This research has demonstrated that attempting to recall information leads to stronger memory, than being told of rereading the information. In this talk I will describe how I have tried to incorporate spaced recall in my classes, and the ways it aids me as an instructor to make pedagogical decisions. I will also speculate on the cognitive skills that may aid student recall.

In consecutive semesters, students from a second-semester introductory college physics course have been asked to report who they worked with on physics outside class time. In the first semester, the course was taught in a traditional lecture class setting. In the second semester the course was taught by the same instructor with similar class size, implementing aspects of Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) where students worked collaboratively in group learning activities. Our study suggests that implementing an in-class interactive learning environment can help foster the informal learning community outside of the classroom. Using social network analysis, we have analyzed the relationship between students positions in the informal learning communities formed outside the classroom with their performance in the course. Our results indicate that being integrated into the informal learning community outside of the classroom can help students, especially weaker ones, to succeed in their introductory physics courses.

Although the number of students earning bachelors degrees in physics has increased, the percentage of those degrees earned by women has not increased for more than 10 years. We use a physics identity framework to understand the factors that may impact physics career choice. Physics identity consists of three dimensions: recognition (perception of recognition by others), interest (desire to learn more), and performance/competence (perception of ability to understand). Our previous work has shown that recognition and interest are more significant predictors of physics career choice than performance/competence, and that women may require more recognition than men in order to choose physics careers. Therefore, teaching strategies that specifically target recognition and interest should be identified. Using data from a survey administered to a nationally representative sample of college students, we use regression models to determine which teaching strategies predict recognition and which strategies predict interest.

Students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds in the United States face unique challenges across the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields, but the situation in physics is especially concerning: of all the physics bachelor degrees awarded nationwide, only 4% go to Hispanic students. This problematic level of participation can be investigated through the construct of physics identity, or how strongly a student feels like a physics person, which has been shown to be correlated with the likelihood of choosing a physics career. Because physics identity may be impacted by a students social interactions, Network Analysis may be used to explore the relationship between a students calculated centrality a measure of how embedded or central a particular student is within the classroom social network and their physics identity. In this study, we investigate this relationship for students in a collaborative-learning Modeling Instruction introductory physics course at Florida International University.

The Physics and Astronomy Department at Michigan State University recently began to redesign its introductory physics courses. At the center of this transformation effort is an attempt to include scientific practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas in the assessments and instruction of the courses. As part of a research effort, we have been developing the Three-Dimensional Learning Assessment Protocol (3D-LAP) to characterize how assessments used in introductory courses change over time. This instrument provides criteria by which scientific practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas can be identified within assessment items. Additionally, this instrument can be used to help write new assessment items or improve existing ones. This presentation will focus on the 3D-LAP and using it to track changes in assessments over time as well as to build assessment items that incorporate all three dimensions.

The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) has become a standard instrument for assessing changes in student attitudes. The standard data analysis protocol compares student responses to those of experts, and assigns a percentage ranking to each respondent. This analysis assumes students fall on a continuum from novice to expert. Another analysis model, the Rasch Model, is also based on this assumption. The Rasch Model also provides information about survey items simultaneously with information about respondents. For this reason, the Rasch Model provides an alternate, and perhaps more robust, method of analyzing CLASS data. To compare the Rasch Model to the traditional analysis methods, we have applied the Rasch Model to data that had been previously analyzed using the protocol developed at the University of Colorado. We will present the results of the Rasch Analysis, and discuss the differences between it and the standard analysis.

In previous research we have shown that novice physics students distinguish between the concept of a net vector quantity and the concept of a total vector quantity. Introductory physics textbooks variably use the terms net, total or resultant when referring to a vector sum, with some textbooks using these terms interchangeably. In particular, we have shown that students distinguish between the concepts of net force and total force, and the concepts of net momentum and total momentum. Phase two of this research has been to analyse the reasons students give for making these distinctions. Using an approach suggested by Grounded Theory, free responses from 400 freshmen have been analyzed and broad reasoning trends have been identified. These trends are contrasted with foundational representational schemas posited by the cognitive sciences, such as changing position versus changing state, and interior viewpoint versus exterior viewpoint.

Constructed response questions (short-answer, open-ended items) have the potential to provide more insight on student thinking than the multiple choice questions often employed in large introductory STEM courses. However, the time and costs associated with the evaluation and analysis of large data sets of constructed response has traditionally been a barrier to their adoption. In an effort to provide instructors with greater insight into their student understanding of core STEM concepts the Automated Analysis of Constructed Response (AACR, www.msu.edu/~aacr) Research Group is working to create a system for the automated analysis of student constructed responses. In this presentation we present recent work developing constructed response items to evaluate students understanding of foundational concepts in physics and astronomy, and discuss preliminary results produced by these items.

The Force Concept Inventory (FCI) has become a world standard as an instrument to measure students conceptual understanding of Mechanics. In particular, the Normalized Gain has proven to be a robust measure of the effect of pedagogy upon student learning. While the original FCI was developed in English, translations have been made. In this study seeks to determine the effect, if any, of administering the FCI in different languages to different groups of students, taken from the same student population. As an English language university in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Alfaisal University is an excellent laboratory for such a study. The FCI has been administered to all introductory physics students at Alfaisal, at the beginning and the end of the first physics course spring 2015 semester. The students were randomly assigned English and Arabic administrations. Results for the first semester of this study will be presented along with preliminary analysis.

There is a split in teaching the concepts of weight and gravitation in physics education (Galili, 2001). One group of physics teaches weight as the gravitational force within the developed Newtonian framework (e.g. Young and Freedman, 2012). The second group adopts the modern framework based on the operational definition of weight (e.g. Knight, 2013). Normally the authors in each group ignore the other view. We suggest teaching weight within the cultural perspective (Galili, 2012) which displays the two options and argues for the modern one the operationally defined weight which does not coincide with the gravitational force. We have performed a comprehensive study on this subject (Stein, 2012) which included teaching experiments in which we applied a constructivist dialogical teaching of the topic of Weight-Gravitation. Our findings showed the ability of students to distinguish between weight and gravitation and meaningfully understand these concepts (Stein & Galili, 2014).

We present an experiment in which subjects with differing levels of physics experience were timed in their ability to detect small changes in nearly identical pairs of diagrams that are representative of typical introductory physics situations. It was hypothesized that higher physics expertise would guide attention and result in faster detection times for those changes that affected the physics, whereas no expertise advantage in detection times would result for changes that did not affect the physics. Our findings partially confirmed the hypothesis. We present results on how the response time for noticing physics-relevant changes in the diagram pairs is faster than for physics-irrelevant changes for those with more extensive physics experience and slower for those with less extensive physics experience. We discuss the cognitive implications of our findings.

As part of a broader study aimed at understanding the first-year laboratory experience from various perspectives, we report on a pilot study in which we probed students perceptions of the first-year lab course at the end of the first term. For this purpose we developed a written instrument comprising five questions regarding the following areas of interest: expectations, enjoyment, learning, relation to course content, and assessment. Each question on the instrument is framed as a debate in which different points of view were posited. The respondents were requested to choose the view with which they most closely agreed (forced choice response), and more importantly, were directed to explain their choice in detail (free response writing). We detail the analysis and report on some of the preliminary findings focusing on the aspects of enjoyment and the learning experience

Testwiseness is generally defined as the set of cognitive strategies used by a student and intended to improve their score on a test regardless of the tests subject matter. To improve our understanding of the potential effect size of several well documented elements of testwiseness, we analyze student performance on questions present in the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) that contain distractors, the selection of which can be related to the use of testwiseness strategies. We further examine the effects of both the positive and potential negative effects of testwiseness on student scores by developing two modified versions of the FCI designed to include additional elements related to testwiseness. Details of the development of the modified versions of the FCI and the effect sizes measured in all versions of the FCI will be discussed.

Research over several decades has shown that active self-monitoring is characteristic of expert learners. More recent studies have examined student metacognition in introductory physics contexts. As part of a multi-institutional collaborative effort, we have been investigating reflective metacognition student ability to describe in hindsight what they have learned about a specific physics concept, and how they have learned it. We are interested in how student descriptions of their own learning compare with how instructors might evaluate their learning. Our methodology involves matched written assessment questions given at the start and end of a learning episode. After the post-test, students reflect on how their thinking has changed. Comparison of self-reported and researcher-characterized changes allows the accuracy of student reflections to be examined. The study design was described in a presentation at the Winter 2015 AAPT meeting in San Diego; the current talk shares preliminary results.

Already in 1630 we find an author noting that learners are liable to respond "by rote, as parrots." If we would avoid this in our teaching, we should imitate the method of questioning used by Socrates: "Some dialogues in Plato were worth the reading, where the singular dexterity of Socrates in this kind may be observed and imitated." The author is George Herbert, the work is "A Priest to the Temple: the Country Parson, His Character, and rule of Holy Life", and the activity at hand is catechizing the faithful. I am fascinated that Herbert addresses an issue still important to contemporary reformers of Physics education, using the same words. In this brief talk I try to establish analogues between ecclesiastical educational practices in 1630 England and contemporary USA, and translate Herbert's advice for reform into terms suitable for the training of physics teachers.

The medical degree at the University of Cape Town is a six-year undergraduate degree, including a one semester physics course (PHY1025) during the first year. In previous years students have often expressed negative sentiments toward the laboratory component of the course in which a fairly rigorous approach to measurement had been adopted viewing it as disconnected from the theory or simply as irrelevant to their medical training. This has led to revising the laboratory curriculum, focusing on two goals (1) improving the connection between lab and lectures and (2) highlighting skills that are relevant for a future as a medical doctor. As part of the evaluation of the new labs (being piloted for the first time) we are using E-CLASS to measure student attitude at the start (February) and the end of the course (May). We briefly describe the new laboratory curriculum and then present our results.

While the STEM education community has developed many new pedagogies and materials, not many have been successful in reaching a wide audience. This study is part of a larger effort to understand how new pedagogies and materials can become widely used, by learning more about those that have become well-propagated. Experts across STEM disciplines were asked to identify well-propagated instructional strategies and materials in their disciplines. We created a categorization scheme for the strategies and materials and gathered evidence to evaluate the extent to which the innovations they suggested had propagated. This presentation will discuss the general characteristics of well-propagated instructional strategies and materials. Most have been funded by multiple grants over time and emphasize changes in approaches to instruction, not changes to content. Further, their propagation strategies were adapted to the resources and degree of collaboration with colleagues required by the instructional strategy.

To provide opportunities for students to engage meaningfully with core disciplinary concepts and practices in physics, an introductory calculus-based mechanics course was designed so that students collaborated in small groups to solve complex story problems. Our research focuses on how collaboration between group members affects their opportunities to learn and do physics. Qualitative methods were used to analyze video-recorded small group discussions over a three-week period. The dynamics of the social interactions between group members were analyzed through positioning theory (Davies & Harr, 1990). Preliminary findings indicate that group members seemed to position themselves as capable of doing physics. Additionally, each group member was positioned by his or her peers and/or instructor as either more or less knowledgeable in doing physics. As a work in progress, we report on how students negotiate these positionings from multiple sources.

Successful pedagogical change in an institution is often built on a foundation of prior efforts and can have a non-linear trajectory. North Carolina State Universitys Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies (SCALE-UP) is a studio-style instructional approach that modifies the classroom structure and pedagogy to promote interaction. There can be challenges when adopting this radical reform, which reconceptualizes the role of teacher and student in a novel learning environment. Using case studies of SCALE-UP secondary implementers, we explore the beginnings of SCALE-UP within departments in a variety of institutions and STEM disciplines. We examine the context of these departments and institutions prior to SCALE-UP, the key players who drive the change, and the events and strategies that lead to implementation. This talk notes commonalities and differences that occurred in successful SCALE-UP implementations. Does successful educational change follow a strategic plan or does serendipity play a significant role?

I will report on two years of results of a study designed to measure the effectiveness of an instructional strategy known as two-stage exams or collaborative group exams. This exam format first has the students take the exam individually. Once all the students have handed in their individual exams, they organize into collaborative groups of three or four and take the same exam again with only a single copy of the exam being given to each group. Different versions of the group exam feature different subsets of the questions from the individual exam. Questions isomorphic to the exam questions were administered on the end-of-course diagnostic and comparisons, using the relevant isomorphic question, are made between the students that saw a given question on the group exam and those that did not.

Andragogy is the "art and science" of teaching adults. Is it necessary to distinguish between Pedagogy and Andragogy when modeling learning experiences specifically for the adult learner? The EMPACTS (Educationally Managed Projects Advancing Curriculum, Technology and Service) project-based learning model was developed specifically for the unique needs of the adult learner. Courses that employ the EMPACTS delivery system, use the EMPACTS project to enhance the learning of course content as adult learners transition from a socialized "passive" learning experience to one of "active," self-directed ownership in the process. Pedagogical frameworks are historically designed for K-12 learners who need structure, direction and greater facilitation in the learning process. Adult learners learn best if they are allowed to use their own knowledge and life experiences as they apply specific course content to real world problems. The EMPACTS model encourages collaboration and the use of technology as adult learners design and complete semester long projects.

As part of a project to explore successful strategies for using studio methods, such as SCALE-UP, we explore self-regulatory abilities and learning approaches of students in said courses at three universities with varying student populations and differing success in studio-mode courses. We survey students using compiled questions from several existing surveys designed to measure student characteristics such as attitudes toward and motivations for learning, organization of scientific knowledge, experiences outside the classroom, and demographics. Here, we utilize clustering methods to group students into learning profiles to better understand the study strategies and motives of algebra-based studio physics students. We present results from first-semester and second-semester studio-mode introductory physics courses across three universities, totaling 11 classrooms with 10 different instructors. We identify several distinct learning profiles and evaluate demographic and concept inventory performance differences between them.

Modeling how students think about physics is often measured via observation of students solving physics problems [1]. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may inform how these processes occur, but currently no neuroimaging studies have examined how students develop physics problem-solving skills. To provide insight into the neural nature of physics learning we examined resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in brain regions associated with problem-solving. Meta-analysis identified the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) as the region most consistently implicated across problem-solving tasks. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired pre/post instruction in eight undergraduate, first-time enrollees in introductory physics. Correspondence between post-instruction rsFC and meta-analytic results suggests a semester of university physics may facilitate enhanced recruitment of posterior brain regions involved in reasoning. Increased IFG-correlated activity from pre to post instruction indicates intrinsic brain connectivity may be modulated as a result of educational experience.

Instruction that makes use of contrasting cases has been extremely successful. Furthermore, contrasting cases appear to be at the center of expert problem-solving strategies. Previously we have shown that physics experts make use of contrasting cases more frequently than any other epistemological or reasoning process resource. Gaining a deeper understanding of the function of these contrasting cases can help physics educators better incorporate contrasting cases into instruction. In this talk, we analyze the function of contrasting cases as a part of the problem- solving process of a group of physics experts as they solve a novel, challenging physics problem. We show how the ideas of variation theory can help us better understand the function of these contrasting cases and discuss how the knowledge gained through this analysis can inform the development of effective instruction.

Self-efficacy beliefs that play a major role in determining teachers science teaching practices have been an important area of concern for pre-service science teacher education. This mixed-methods study investigated the changes in pre-service elementary teachers science self-efficacy beliefs and its relationship with changes in science content understandings in a specialized physics content course. Participants included 51 pre-service elementary science teachers enrolled in two term of the course. Data collection included implementation of Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument-B (STEBI-B) and Physical Science Concept Test as pre- and post-test as well as semi-structured interviews, observations and artifacts. A pre-post, repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) design was used to test the significance of differences between the pre- and post-surveys across time. Results indicated statistically significant gains in participants self-efficacy beliefs, personal science teaching beliefs, and outcome expectancy beliefs. Additionally, a positive moderate relationship between science conceptual understandings and personal science teaching efficacy beliefs was found. Findings from qualitative analysis suggest that despite of the nature of prior science experiences pre-service teachers previously had, exposure to a specialized content course that integrates relevant content along with modeled instructional strategies can positively impact self-efficacy beliefs. One implication from this study is that instructors teaching elementary physics content courses could shape science experiences within these courses to potentially support pre-service science teachers self-efficacy beliefs and confidence to teach in future.

Physics Education Research focuses on increasing student engagement and conceptual understanding, prompting different research groups to develop and use new teaching methods and materials in place of traditional ones. It is important for us to understand the basic features that present in course materials and their impacts on students learning. As part of a project to identify successful teaching strategies in studio physics, we are exploring how physics tutorials help students taking algebra-based introductory physics develop conceptual understanding using argumentation in small-group discussion. In order to identify basic features of tutorials, we conducted a literature review and did content analysis of physics tutorials; then, we videotaped groups of students working through physics tutorials. We analyzed the transcriptions of the students discussions and compared them to pre- and post-test results to understand how basic features facilitate students use of argumentation and development of conceptual understanding

The ability to judge the difficulty of physics problems has implications for both exam preparation and performance. Previous research has shown that students spend more time studying problems they judge as more difficult, but this strategy is effective only when these judgments match the normative difficulty of the questions. Little is known about how accurate instructors and students are at judging problem difficulty. We present data from two experiments where physics experts and introductory physics students predict which question of a pair taken from real exams is more difficult for the typical student. In the first experiment we analyze whether the rationales given by physics experts are predictive of accurate judgments. In the second experiment we compare the accuracy of experts and novices in their judgments. We discuss the educational implications of our findings.

Student reasoning in physics is often context dependent. A possible explanation is that salient features in physics problems may cue automatic and subconscious (System 1) reasoning. Students often accept these first-available responses without question and do not reflect on their reasoning processes, even when such processes are unproductive and preclude the use of relevant conceptual understanding. Metacognition, the monitoring and regulation of ones thinking, around these salient features has the potential to address such difficulties. As part of a broader effort to identify methods for improving student learning in physics by explicitly supporting and enhancing student metacognition, we are currently investigating an instructional intervention focused on the development of students metacognitive knowledge about salient features and cued System 1 reasoning. In this intervention, students are guided to synthesize contrasting cases involving sample student responses and descriptive vignettes highlighting the targeted metacognitive knowledge. Preliminary data and emerging findings will be presented.

Collaborative group-learning environments, including studio-based or SCALE-UP instruction, have grown in popularity and implementation at a wide variety of institutions. We are engaged in a multi-institutional project aimed at studying the factors that contribute to the success of student-centered pedagogical approaches in algebra-based physics courses. In this regard, the GW group is specifically focusing on documenting instructor actions and student activities taking place in the classroom; thus, we have been conducting systematic observations and analyses of various classroom environments. Our data, recorded as a chronological series of codes in the Teaching Dimensions Observational Protocol (TDOP), reflect the time sequence and pedagogical characteristics of classroom events. We have used a PER evidence-based approach to choose an efficient set of codes and have applied these codes during many observations at GW as well as at our partner institutions. We present here our final list of TDOP codes and inter-rater reliability results from our field-testing of this code set.

Student-centered instruction can lead to strong gains in physics learning. However, even after targeted instruction, many students still struggle to analyze unfamiliar situations systematically. As a part of an ongoing investigation of student reasoning in the context of carefully designed, research-based scaffolded instruction, sequences of questions have been developed that allow for probing the relationships among conceptual understanding, reasoning, and intuition. Results from sequences of questions administered in the introductory calculus-based mechanics course will be presented. The dual process theory of reasoning will be applied to interpret the results. Implications for research and instruction will be discussed.

Students have substantial difficulties applying physics concepts to anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology (AP&P;) and vice versa. We have focused our research on developing a kinesthetic circulatory system, which requires students to apply multiple concepts (conservation of mass, compliance, Bernoulli and Hagen-Poiseuille principles) to understanding the operation of the cardiovascular system. Kinesthetic models allow students to manipulate different aspects of the simulated system. We engineered a circulatory system model made of transparent plastic tubing of different radii, branched connectors, balloons, and pumps that enabled students to see the fluid travel at different speeds (visually) and pressures (through pressure sensors) as the fluid travels through a model cardiovascular system. Pre- and post- assessment through interviews, open-ended questions and draft multiple-choice questions indicate substantial improvement in student understanding and appreciation of real fluid dynamics concepts. Two other IPLS Kinesthetic models are also being developed surrounding the physics concepts encompassing diffusion and electrophoresis. *Supported by NSF DUE 1044154

Recently the physics community has been conducting transformations to make physics classes more relevant to life science majors. A primary goal for many of these classes is to help students to develop coherent understanding of essential ideas that span multiple disciplines. Energy, for example, is an important idea in biology, chemistry, and physics, but students often compartmentalize their knowledge and do not see energy as an essential idea to all three disciplines. This presentation will outline the preliminary development of an instrument based on semi-structured interviews to assess how students connect essential ideas across introductory science disciplines. This instrument will provide important information to the research community about the effects of ongoing and future university initiatives in making progress in our design of physics for life science majors classes.

Iconic problems have proven to be a useful paradigm to analyze physics curricula. Though these share many of the characteristics of threshold concepts (transformative, integrative, bounded, ) the iconic problem paradigm allows a closer analysis to the physics curriculum by identifying key problems. Recently the author has begun using the iconic problem paradigm to identify key topics in the biology used in an IPLS course. The paper focuses on the characteristics of iconic problems and their relationship to threshold concepts, identifying the iconic physics problems in an IPLS course, and reports on the characterization of the biology topics of the IPLS course as iconic problems/threshold concepts.

Designed to both uncover areas of students difficulty as well as provide a reliable and valid method to measure student learning, Conceptual Learning Assessment Instruments (CLAIs) have been essential to the pedagogical improvement within many physics courses. However, to date there exists a dearth of CLAIs developed specifically to assess students conceptual understanding of concepts unique to the introductory physics courses for life sciences (IPLS). To fill this need, we are currently developing a Fluid Dynamics CLAI specifically for the IPLS course. One of the first steps in assessment development is the determination of the concept domain that will be utilized to create the instrument. We chose to use a Delphi process to reach a consensus among 14+ physics, biology and biophysics on the key concepts to be covered on the instrument. In this talk, we will discuss the details of Delphi process and present the final fluid dynamics concept domain.

Research and logic both indicate that students learn more when they are engaged with the material. In a two-week summer transition course for students planning to major in any STEM field, we related all physics content to motor vehicle collisions. The students in the course had a wide range of previous exposure to physics and a range of intended majors (biology, chemistry, physics/engineering, math and environmental science). The topic engaged non-physics majors and allowed students with extensive preparation in physics to work on more advanced exercises, such as accident reconstruction. Students responded positively to the topic and more importantly, showed a normalized gain on the FCI of 0.230.06 (SE), comparable to a full semester, traditional lecture physics course. We will present an overview of the course, sample exercises and students responses to the course. This approach could be effectively modified for any introductory physics course.

We analyzed the relationship between students participation in classroom review sessions during two Interactive Learning Environment (ILE) physics courses in a studio format that implemented the Investigative-Science-Learning-Environment (ISLE) curriculum and their success through the courses. Research has shown that ILE can be an effective learning environment for acquiring transferrable knowledge. These classroom review sessions took place at the beginning of each class meeting throughout the two courses and were student directed. To quantify students participation we coded the review session in real time without videotaping according to a coding scheme that we developed which included codes for interacting, disengagement and uncodable. Each student was assigned a single code for the entire review session. We found that students interactional codes during the first semester were strongly predictive of their interactional codes during a subsequent semester. This indicates that students directed interaction does not bring changes in their nature of participation.

A one-quarter-long algebra-based introductory physics course for pre-health and life science majors at Portland State features authentic biomedically inspired physics content. The course uses multimedia-learning-modules via flipitphysics.com (formerly smartphysics). These modules include videos with biomedical experts explaining aspects of specific biomedical equipment. Students answer "Pre-lecture questions" and "Checkpoints" during and after these videos on both the medical content covered in the video media and the physics concepts in written materials provided for students in order to prepare them for activities during the class. Students continue to engage with the material during class and through online homework assignments that explore the connections of physics and the medical field in a quantitative manner. We have attempted to assess the cognitive level using a modified Blooms taxonomy with further analysis of questions sequence and student performance. We also report on the positive impact on students attitudes as measured by the CLASS.

The importance of strengthening STEM education in public schools is a theme that is currently at the center of discussions in education reform. Research has shown that in order to improve science programs we first need to develop good teacher education programs. In this study we investigate whether a redesigned physics class for future elementary teachers addresses three main issues in elementary teacher preparation (Mikeska et al. 2009): engagement in science, understanding of childrens ideas of science, and understanding the relevance of what future teachers learn in class for their impending careers. To do this we evaluate whether the incorporation of social structures in the class impact students engagement in science by integrating PCK into the core of the class to see if it produces changes in students knowledge of kids ideas and frames learning in an expansive manner that promotes transfer. *Supported in part by NSF grant 1140855.

When grading student papers it seems that students are always changing their multiple choice answers from right to wrong. Colleagues have made similar observations and some books on test taking advise against answer changing.(1) Intrigued, I collected some data and dug a little deeper into the research. My hypothesis was that students most frequently changed their answers from right to wrong. The subjects were 985 college physics students enrolled in a two-semester calculus-based physics course. Did students most frequently change their answers from right to wrong, from wrong to right or from wrong to wrong? How do my results compare to similar studies? Was there a difference between results for the two semesters? Answers to these questions will be discussed as well as implications for further studies.

Not all wrong answer choices are created equal. We introduce a new tool for adoption by high school and college-level physics teachers who use a common assessment such as the Force Concept Inventory (FCI). The tool uses a spreadsheet application to create a simple matrix that identifies the percentage of students that who select each possible pre-/post-test answer combination on each question of the diagnostic exam such as the FCI. Having ranked each answer choice from best to worst (using Item Response Curves as our guide), the transition matrices provide detailed information on the percentages of students that move toward better or worse answer choices on the pre-/post-test and identify the misconceptions they may have. The transition matrices tool provides a way to better meet the needs of our students by tailoring our instruction in an informed way.

Physics education research has consistently shown that students have higher learning outcomes when enrolled in interactive-engagement courses. Consequently, many schools are actively reforming their introductory curricula. For courses where the interactive sections (labs, tutorials, and/or workshops) are mostly taught by graduate student teaching assistants (TAs), good TAs are instrumental to the success of the reform. Many studies have investigated specific interactions between TAs and students, but more can be learned through a holistic examination of TA-student interactions. Over the course of one semester, I observed TAs in their various teaching roles using the Real-time Instructor Observation Tool (RIOT). These observations serve to show what TAs may default to with little to no intervention. I present a snapshot of a department in the early stages of reform and discuss how we used RIOT data to develop training targeted to the specific needs of our TAs.

During the summer of 2014, a faculty team developed a student laboratory skills assessment program to be given in the laboratory courses taken by physics majors. We created a program where the assessment instruments, while unique to each course, all followed a theme that students should be able to set up equipment to Acquire some signal, Analyze data related to the signal, and Assimilate the results by communicating results in a manner consistent with departmental goals. We call the evaluation of students ability for Acquisition, Analysis and Assimilation our AAA activities. This talk is a report on the results from initial implementation in our courses over the past year and an update on the progress made to develop a consistent set of laboratory skills assessment rubrics across the intermediate and advanced laboratory courses in the UW-Whitewater physics program.

Language ambiguities in concept meanings can exacerbate student conceptual difficulties with physics concepts. This is especially true for the construct of weight which is defined in more than one way even by physicists and textbooks and causes particular confusion in accelerating cases. We devised an approach for teaching weight, weightlessness and free fall, which first explains the various physics concepts involved before naming them, discusses the language ambiguities explicitly, and discusses the terms/concepts in multiple physical situations. Three instructors implemented the innovative lesson sequence in three different sections of an introductory physics course. We assessed understanding of the physics concepts using conceptual assessments and surveyed students understanding of the language issues. The results exceeded expectations, with remarkably high practically significant learning gains for the physics concepts, a good appreciation of the language issues and intellectual satisfaction with their grasp of not only conceptual issues but also language issues.

"Responsive teaching," that is, teaching in which instructors shape instruction in response to students ideas, is a promising approach that serves to integrate the epistemic, conceptual, and "practice" aspects of scientific inquiry. However, clearly characterizing this instructional practice is challenging, as is providing professional development to support responsive teaching. In this talk, I will discuss an approach therapy, "Motivational Interviewing," as a possible direction for both characterizing and supporting this practice.

The Big Five Inventory (BFI) measuring the 5-factor personality model was given to 440 science and engineering students in introductory physics classes at a large U.S. university. Science and engineering students showed similar personality characteristics as would be expected from measurements of the general population, with women scoring significantly differently only on the neuroticism scale. The BFI facets had differential explanatory power for test average and course grade with the conscientiousness facet as the only significant treatment effect for course grade, but it was not significant for test average. High school GPA explained substantially different levels of variance in course grade for male and female students; these differences were reduced with the addition of BFI facets to the regression models.

Generally, it is difficult to assess the knowledge and competencies of physics students at high school, who prepare for contests. There are multiple educational approaches, such as didactical and competency-based methodologies which can help either teachers or students to improve their skills in problem-solving techniques and understanding Physics phenomena. However, using such traditional methods, it is hard to evaluate and control the individual learning progress of students continuously. Therefore, application of Educational Framework Tools seems to be a good choice to extend the support functions in classes. This paper discusses the benefits of E-learning technologies applied to helping students for physics contest preparations. Several embedded E-learning functions are being applied and to tuition in physics. The outcome of innovative educational methods and extensions has been evaluated. Our tuition methods resulted in achieving a dynamically changing educational framework that can be matched to our students and to the actual physics contest.

In this talk, we analyze students identity trajectories as undergraduate physics majors participating in physics research. Students in the study participated in an elective seminar in which they were paired with graduate students and faculty mentors on physics research projects and participated in a weekly discussions about research. In one-on-one interviews and classroom discussions, students described changes in their participation in the broader physics community, as well as more sophisticated ideas about what constitutes participation in that community. Using their narrative accounts, we discuss students trajectories of their participation in the community, highlighting relational dynamics between themselves and other members of the physics community. Finally, we draw out connections between these trajectories, which have implications for future research and programmatic design.

It was postulated that if students reflected metacognitively on textual material before coming to class and then had interventions in class that had them examine subjects that produce cognitive dissonance, the students epistemological beliefs would evolve from those characterizing a novice learning towards those consistent with a more expert learner. This hypothesis was tested through a five-year study involving close to 1000 students at two institutions, in four physics courses. Using student interviews, writing product assessments, and the Discipline-Focused Epistemological Beliefs Questionnaire (DFEBQ) as a pre-and post-test of the students, our results, based on both qualitative and quantitative data, are a strong indication that a combination of an activity that gets students to examine textual material metacognitively (Reflective Writing) with one or more interactive interventions can promote positive change in students epistemological beliefs.

This fall we have introduced a new type of online homework activity designed to help students become proficient with some fundamental concepts necessary to succeed in introductory physics. For each concept several equivalent sets of questions have been created. Each student is assigned one set of the questions. Instead of being given immediate feedback on the correctness of their answers, they are given help in the form of the solution to a different version of the questions. This talk will summarize results from the student interactions, and implications for improving student learning from online homework activities.

Education developers in STEM fields have many ideas on improving undergraduate instruction, but often these ideas fail to propagate to other educators. Our research group has worked to understand best practices in developing educational innovations with sustainable adoption by others in mind. We have run in-person and online workshops in which we train others and have them apply what they learned to their grant proposals. In this talk, we discuss the benefits and limitations of an online setting for professional development and online workshops as a dissemination mechanism.

The Postsecondary Instructional Practices Survey (PIPS), developed by a team of researchers at Western Michigan University, is a valid and reliable survey instrument to measure teaching practices in higher education. The survey asks respondents to describe how representative a set of statements is of their teaching (e.g., I provide feedback on student assignments without assigning a formal grade.) One way to analyze the data is using instructor-centered and student-centered categories. These categories can be graphically represented as a scatterplot with quadrants indicating different levels of instructor- and student-centered practices. In this presentation, we further our understanding of the quantitative survey data through qualitative data. We interviewed survey respondents in each quadrant to learn more about their teaching practices and to be able to better interpret what each quadrant means in terms of teaching practices.

Improved problem-solving is considered one of the primary student learning goals for many physics courses, yet most textbooks do not describe the complexities of problem-solving. To be successful at problem-solving, students must learn to employ metacognitive skills so they can monitor and correct their own work. This process typically yields non-linear solutions that bear little resemblance to the worked examples in textbooks. A survey of how popular introductory physics texts describe and illustrate the problem-solving process will be presented. Most portray problem-solving as a linear process devoid of any metacognition. Rather than showing examples of how one can identify and correct errors within a solution with monitoring, they show only correct and optimized solutions. Implications for teachers and students will be discussed.

Shared experiences, shared culture, and a strong sense of community play an important role in instructional environments in the Chicago State University STEM program. In this presentation we explore how listening to student input and connecting our science education efforts to the culture and community of our population has allowed us, as researchers and instructors that often come from different communities, to develop a more effective program. The CSU Learning Assistant (LA) Program and the CSU S-STEM Program will serve as examples of efforts toward building a welcoming, community-based learning environment.

This project focuses on finding a meaningful way to write multiple-choice questions on exams. One of the most important aspects of a physics exam is to test the students' ability to solve problems, not just answer questions. We have also noticed that when grading free-response problems on physics tests for large classes, it is necessary to use a certain rubric. In other words, it is necessary to be able to quickly look for certain mistakes and take off a certain number of points for that mistake. This process becomes very formulaic. We have substituted a series of multiple-choice questions for each worked-out problem. One free-response problem is rotated between versions of the test as a check. So far, this has worked well and doesnt appear to have changed the way the students prepare for exams.

This process includes: interviews with the target audience to determine their needs and expectations; identification of key tasks that the website must enable; design of pages to support those tasks; usability testing to ensure that the site meets users needs; and design iteration based on the results of usability testing. I summarize lessons learned from the design of several websites that offer educational materials and tools to physics educators, and present examples of how the particular needs of this audience can be best addressed in web design. I offer recommendations for anyone wishing to offer educational research or materials via the web.

Self-regulation is an internal process where students create an effective environment for constructing knowledge. Constructivist-learning theory suggests that strong self-regulators are efficient learners. Grader assessment feedback (GAF) is a powerful tool instructors can utilize to influence student self-regulation and thus student construction of knowledge. I present results found by applying a qualitative coding scheme, developed in a previous pilot study, in a quasi-experimental investigation. Previously, it was found that students are demonstrating all the aspects of self-regulation defined in this study and different styles of GAF result in different manifestations of student self-regulation. This study presents results from survey data collected in different semesters, different populations, and with a significantly larger sample size. The same coding scheme, along with any open codes that develop, will be used to determine what physics student self-regulation looks like and how different GAF styles affect physics student self-regulation in light of the preliminary data.

Research has shown that even after targeted instruction designed to address student conceptual and reasoning difficulties, some introductory physics students still tend to apply intuitive rather than formal reasoning on specific types of questions. In this study, metacognitive interventions were designed and implemented in an effort to encourage the students to reflect on their thought processes. Specifically, students were asked to consider alternative solutions, identify formal and intuitive approaches, and reflect on their own thinking. The impact of these metacognitive interventions on student reasoning was examined. The dual-process theory to reasoning and decision-making was applied in order to interpret the results. *This work has been supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.

Physics by Inquiry (PbI) is a research-based and research-validated curriculum designed by the Physics Education Group at the University of Washington. (1) Development and testing has taken place both in courses for K-12 teachers and in courses for students who are under-prepared for STEM-related careers. The guided-inquiry instructional approach has proved effective at helping both populations develop a firm conceptual understanding of basic physics topics, while also enhancing their reasoning and problem solving skills and their understanding of the scientific process. This talk will provide insight and data that support the use of PbI in providing an opportunity for under-prepared students to develop in-depth understanding, proficiency in the targeted skills, and recognition of the usefulness of the PbI experience in their future study of STEM topics.

We recorded pre-service physics teachers learning about the physics of solar cells. Using a knowledge-in-pieces theoretical framework, we analyze their interactions in order to make inferences about the elements of prior knowledge they call upon as they build understanding of how these devices function. Of special interest are the instances when a student makes a significant conceptual breakthrough. We find that students who combine different aspects of their prior knowledge in specific ways may be more likely to make breakthroughs. We will discuss what instructors can do to prime learners to combine knowledge in productive ways so they are better able to achieve these breakthroughs.

As part of an ongoing investigation of the development of student reasoning abilities in physics, we have been examining inconsistencies in student reasoning in introductory physics courses. Research has shown that even when students demonstrate that they possess the formal knowledge and skills necessary to answer specific types of questions correctly, some of these students abandon formal reasoning in favor of more intuitive approaches on analogous tasks. For this reason, we have been identifying and developing sequences of questions that allow for the disentanglement of various factors that affect student thinking (e.g., conceptual understanding, reasoning abilities, and contextual cues). Preliminary results from one such sequence will be presented and interpreted using the dual-process theory of reasoning and decision-making. *This work has been supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.

This study was motivated by research findings that suggest that, on certain topics, student conceptual and reasoning difficulties persist even after instruction expressly designed to address such difficulties. We have been developing a suite of different metacognitive interventions for use in introductory calculus-based physics courses. Interventions intended to promote (individual) student metacognition were administered in a web-based format outside of class. Interventions supporting socially mediated metacognition were implemented as part of laboratory instruction. The metacognitive interventions were multi-layered in order to address specific types of student responses. The impacts of these interventions were assessed on a course exam.

Upper division physics courses combine challenging physics content with increased mathematical complexity. Many physics departments offer a course in mathematical methods to help prepare students for upper-division theory courses in electricity and magnetism, classical mechanics, and modern physics. As part of an NSF-supported research and curriculum development project, we have studied student reasoning in math methods using written free-response problems and individual student interviews. In this talk we present data on student reasoning with series approximations collected in the context of a meth methods course.

Understanding of Electricity & Magnetism in the upper-division requires a considerable amount of integration of calculus concepts with abstract physics concepts. The ability to incorporate the use of vectors in several different coordinate systems is an essential skill in an E&M; course. This study aims to understand how students think about coordinate systems and vectors in non-Cartesian coordinate systems (plane polar and spherical). Data was collected in a math methods course for physics majors over several semesters, using free response written questions posed on ungraded quizzes and graded course assessments given after instruction. Student responses were coded and assigned to categories. As an example, many students answering incorrectly appear to be overgeneralizing from Cartesian coordinate systems in ways that are not productive.

We analyze the reasoning sequence that students must go through to complete these questions correctly, and identify the points at which students are most likely to fail to move through the chain appropriately.

As part of a broader study on the content of and student thinking within mathematics in the undergraduate physics curriculum, we report on student thinking about coordinate systems in the upper division. Early evidence suggests that upper-division physics students struggle to solve problems and answer conceptual questions requiring the use of Cartesian and non-Cartesian coordinate systems. Specifically, students have difficulty identifying the direction of unit vectors and constructing symbolic expressions for position and velocity in the plane polar coordinates. Additionally, students struggle to recognize appropriate units associated with these quantities. We report findings from one-on-one interviews that used a think aloud protocol designed to shed light on student thinking within this domain. We investigate the potential connection between student reasoning regarding Cartesian and non-Cartesian coordinates with emphasis on polar and spherical coordinate systems, and students ability to answer conceptual questions and solve problems requiring the use of those coordinate systems.

In a previous study, we found that many students experienced significant difficulties with a basic task in which they were asked to express a distance in terms of wavelength. At the same time, most students were capable of measuring a distance in terms of nonstandard units (e.g., a pencil) in a more everyday context. Various factors were considered in attempt to account for this failure to transfer relevant skills between the two tasks. For example, we considered the roles of representation, context, mathematical emphasis of instruction on interference, and others. In the current study, we designed a sequence of questions to probe the impact of epistemology on student judgment about the type of reasoning required to complete this task. Multiple data streams (including written responses, interviews, and eye-tracking data) were used to gain insight into student thinking. *This work has been supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.

Student time use is a major element of success in any course, especially in physics courses in which expertise is earned largely through exposure to the problem-solving process. Surveys were developed which probed the distribution of student time use across various typical tasks associated with the introductory, calculus-based physics sequence. These surveys were implemented at four points in each the fall 2015 and spring 2016 semesters. Two of these surveys explored time use during weeks in which students were preparing for the first two exams of the semester, while the other two were implemented during typical non-test weeks. Measurements of incoming student SAT/ACT score, student grade expectations and student test grades were taken. An analysis of this data, including how students at large and potential sub-categories of students regulate their time use in response to exam scores and grade expectations, will be discussed.

Using the Real-time Instructor Observing Tool (RIOT), we observed six Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) and coded for the amount of time they spent on various teaching actions to create an action profile. The GTAs were teaching in a student-centered combined recitation and laboratory mini-studio. At the end of the semester, we asked all GTAs to use the RIOT protocol to describe action profiles from several perspectives: 1) what the course designers want; 2) what the GTA thinks is most helpful; 3) what the students think is most helpful; and 4) what the GTA thinks his/her actual profile resembles. In this talk we compare the responses of an exemplary GTA to find a high amount of buy-in to the mini-studio method but an actual profile that more closely resembled what she believed her students wanted. These findings are supported by the GTAs other responses about her teaching experiences.

Understanding of physics-related concepts is often quantified through physics problem-solving (PPS) assessments. However, no study has characterized neurobiological processes underlying PPS or skill development via classroom instruction. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to delineate PPS brain networks and probe differences resulting from classroom instruction. 15 students underwent pre- and identical post-instruction PPS fMRI sessions. We assessed brain activity and identified regions more engaged post- relative to pre-instruction (P<0.05). Data revealed consistent fronto-parietal networks contributing to PPS. Moreover, significantly increased post-instruction fMRI activity in posterior medial cortex (PMC), accompanied by improved PPS scores, implicated this regions critical role in skill development. As PMC supports spatial memory and attentional focus [1,2], these novel neurobiological observations provide insight into how education experience may augment brain activity which, in turn, contributes to enhanced PPS skills.

This paper presents an analysis of the effect of pre-preparation and effort on the performance in a physics class using data collected over 21 semesters (N=1747). An overall significant negative correlation with total time out-of-class time invested was found (p<0.0001). Cluster analysis was used to identify distinct subgroups of students with different levels of incoming preparation for the class and distinctly different out-of-class study behaviors. The highest performing subgroup invested the lowest out-of-class time but began the class with superior preparation in the material covered. Representation of students of different gender was not uniform across the set of clusters (p<0.0001). Female students were underrepresented in the cluster of students with high pre-preparation and overrepresented in the cluster whose primary mode of exam preparation was reading. Male students were overrepresented in the cluster identified by the failure to submit required assignments.

In order to achieve broader educational change in STEM discipline, research suggests that we need to engage faculty within a discipline, with opportunities to reflect on their teaching over long periods of time. One strategy that achieves this is the embedded expert model, where postdocs and other educational experts are partnered with faculty within a department to support course transformation. This model has been successfully used in the Science Education Initiative (http://colorado.edu/sei) at two institutions, using postdoctoral fellows as embedded experts. This model is being adapted and studied at seven institutions, using various embedded experts, in a new NSF-funded project (TRESTLE; http://www.colorado.edu/csl/trestle) in order to test how this intervention can be implemented in different institutional contexts to propagate widespread STEM education reform. I will discuss the embedded expert model, past results, the variations used in TRESTLE, and how we plan to test them.

Over the past few decades many innovations to improve undergraduate STEM education have been developed, only to fizzle out as they struggle to find an audience. Funding agencies have noticed this problem and are putting increased attention on development projects that build in aspects of sustainability after the project funding has ended. In recent years there has been research done within physics and STEM education on developing and disseminating education research projects. But, there is a much longer history and body of literature with common goals in the business literature related to product development and innovation. In this talk I discuss product development and launching the product from a business perspective, and how what is known about this process can be directly applied to developing and propagating an education innovation. *Supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1122446.

Paired (or co-) teaching is an arrangement in which two faculty are collaboratively responsible for all aspects of teaching a course. By pairing an instructor experienced in research-based instructional strategies (RBIS) with an instructor with little or no experience in RBIS, paired teaching can be used to promote the adoption of RBIS. We report on several examples of instructors who were the relative novices in such pairs. Using data from in-class observations, the Teaching Practices Inventory, and interviews with the instructors, we characterize the extent to which they have continued using RBIS in the courses they have taught after pair-teaching. Preliminary results indicate both a continued use of RBIS when teaching in the same course that they pair-taught in and some transfer of RBIS to new contexts.

In the MainePSP*, we have observed students improve the way they analyze thermal energy after instruction, but that many of them continue to use the idea that coldness transfers. Past researchers have identified that cold is commonly perceived as a separate heat energy. Nevertheless, we have not found specific activities to address this idea. We present the analysis of a collaborative session among K-12 teachers who were trying to analyze how to address coldness in the classroom. During the sessions, teachers got to model the energy in two different scenarios which include an object in room temperature interacting with snow. Then, teachers interacted with two simulations that address thermal energy to consider their utility as an instructional tool. Engaging teachers in these activities led to additional insights and questions about how to convincingly address students observable experience, that coldness transfers, using a thermal energy model.

Robust physics and engineering identities are strong predictors of students choice to pursue a degree in physics or engineering; students who go into either of these fields are often drawn from the same pool of potentially interested high schoolers, who must decide between majoring in the two fields. Many studies of engineering students have treated them as a homogenous population or focus only on one sub-discipline, rather than distinguishing engineers between disciplines more carefully. Recently, we surveyed students on several attitudinal constructs, such as Grit, the Big 5 Personality Traits, and Performance-Approach mindset, which have been correlated with the development of identity and academic success in these fields. Using data from the 2,966 introductory engineering students surveyed, we investigate the associations between student attitudes and both physics and engineering identity and disaggregate by major to uncover differences and similarities which will help broaden a conversation about who can be an engineer.

A recent study of students in a calculus-based introductory physics course found that students performed significantly better on vector addition and subtraction tasks when the questions were given using the ijk representation instead of an "arrows-on-a-grid'' representation, and also presented evidence that working knowledge of the ijk format was necessary to correctly perform vector operations in the arrow format. A follow-up study found that students in an algebra-based physics course also performed significantly higher in the ijk representation than the arrow representation in both one- and two-dimensional problems, even though no explicit ijk instruction was given in the course. In a subsequent investigation we asked students in the algebra-based course to physically interpret their answers, in order to assess if the higher performance on ijk questions indicates physical understanding or is the result of algorithmic "plug-and-chug'' thinking. Our findings will be discussed along with instructional implications.

Social network analysis (SNA) provides a means of studying connections among entities. The information found through SNA has many uses, including identifying key leaders, demonstrating the current state of a system, or documenting change through collecting data at different time intervals. As part of a larger evaluation project related to institutional change, we have collected SNA department-level data related to teaching networks (teaching discussion and advice) in several departments at one institution. These data have been collected every two years for the past six years. This talk will discuss whether and how these networks have changed, striking trends, and ways these data have been used.

The CSU Learning Assistant (LA) program has grown from three students, in one discipline, to 19 students, in five disciplines. Central to this growth is the cultivation of teaching partnerships between LAs and faculty. In these partnerships, student ideas are valued and leveraged to improve the program, inform LA programs across the country, and publicize the program at the local and national level. In this talk we explore how recent interviews with LAs and the implementation of an LA Panel at CSU allows faculty and peers to get a glimpse of the LA Program that would not be possible without student voice. We also explore how the use of student voice to inform the program can create broad scale buy in for the LA Program and other types of instructional reform in the STEM classroom.

Though communication is essential for success in STEM careers, it is typically a minor focus within the undergraduate physics curriculum. With the emphasis of argumentation in K-12 NGSS and key role of collaboration and discussion in active learning environments, it is important to more fully understand how such practices prepare students to communicate effectively in STEM careers. We conducted 30 semi-structured interviews with new hires and their managers in academia and industry, using the field of optics as a disciplinary focus. We coded these interviews using emergent and grounded theory approaches to better understand how communication skills were developed and used in the workplace. Findings include a taxonomy of diverse communication skills ranging from written (e.g. documentation), visual (e.g. interpreting diagrams), and oral (e.g. asking questions) communication. In each case there were unexpected situations where communication was necessary and inseparable from technical knowledge used in the workplace.

Self-regulation is a self-initiated process through which students identify obstacles to their learning, find strategies that will allow them to overcome those obstacles, and finally exert the effort needed to succeed. Through collection of student responses to a web-based survey, we investigate what student self-regulation looks like across different undergraduate physics populations. Specifically, we examine how different styles of feedback on assessments correlate with students self-regulation. We combine two models of self-regulation (1) the Winne & Hadwin model which describes how external feedback influences student self-regulation and (2) Zimmermans cyclical model of student self-regulation consisting of the phases forethought, self-control, and self-judgement to create an a priori coding scheme. Informed by our theory of self-regulation, we also develop emergent, open codes from the data. We hypothesize that instructors can use particular feedback to influence subcomponents of student self-regulation, aiding students knowledge construction.

The Access Network consists of six university-based programs co-working with graduate and undergraduate students from across the country towards a vision of a more diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible STEM community. To realize this vision, Access and its member programs empower students as co-leaders, giving them voice and ownership over local and national efforts. Access sites focus on fostering supportive learning communities, engaging students in authentic science practices, and attending to students' development as STEM professionals. Programmatically, sites offer a range of services from summer programs to academic year mentoring. In this talk, we will share preliminary evidence of our networks efforts: (1) building a community of student representatives committed to communicating across sites, celebrating local successes, and supporting each other through local struggles, (2) developing and implementing our first in-person gathering of student representatives from Access sites, and (3) fostering routines for sharing of ideas across sites.

Physics education researchers have created research results, teaching methods, curricula, and assessments that can dramatically improve physics education. PhysPort (www.physport.org) is the go-to place for ordinary physics faculty to find resources for research-based teaching and assessment. First released in 2011 as the PER User's Guide, PhysPort has undergone re-branding, redesign, and expansion, including many new resources: overviews of over 50 research-based teaching methods and over 50 research-based assessment instruments, Expert Recommendations, the Virtual New Faculty Workshop, the Periscope collection of video-based TA training and faculty professional development materials, and the Assessment Data Explorer, an interactive tool for faculty to get instant analysis and visualization of their students responses to research-based assessment instruments including the FCI, BEMA, and CLASS, and compare their results to national averages and students like theirs. The development of PhysPort includes research to determine faculty needs and usability testing to ensure that we meet those needs.

Because so few physics faculty are formally trained in education and pedagogy, in-service faculty professional development workshops are important for improving teaching skills. While these workshops often address the importance of engaging students in active and reflective classroom activities, emergent research suggests that more can be done to engage faculty workshop attendees in active and reflective activities. In this presentation, we discuss analysis of data collected from implementation of the SPOTing Effective Teaching Workshop series, a professional development experience that integrates use of the Student Participation Observational Tool (SPOT) within a faculty community of practice. This experience incorporates interactive and reflective elements to guide faculty in a shared experience of analyzing their teaching and discussing alternative approaches. Results indicate that as a result of this experience, faculty articulate pedagogical discontentment and identify desired changes to their teaching practice that are more in line with active, student-centered approaches.

Michigan State University (MSU) has collected a wide body of data on students for over 10 years allowing for a robust, statistical picture to be painted of how students enter and exit the physics world. This data includes course grade, gender, ethnicity, student major choices, etc. and can help us paint a pathway of every student who has received a physics bachelor's degree at MSU. While this data set contains over 100,000 students who have taken math and physics courses at MSU only 2% of these students have declared a physics major and only 0.5% of students have gone on to graduate with a bachelors in physics. Students who declare physics and then move away from the major perform poorly in introductory courses and are demographically different from the typical physics graduate.

Students perceptions of self-efficacy in the general university environment have been extensively studied and findings suggest that self-efficacy plays a role in student success. The role of perceived self-efficacy in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) student success is investigated in the current research. A survey measuring students feelings of self-efficacy within multiple environments, including science, mathematics and physics classes as well as within their major department and intended future career, was developed based on Pintrich et al. Self-Efficacy for Learning Performance subscale of the Motivated Learning Strategies Questionnaire. The survey was administered over the fall 2015 and spring 2016 semesters and demographic data was gathered for the introductory, calculus-based physics classes. An analysis of student perceived self-efficacy and its relation to student success will be discussed. The effect of gender and major on perceived self-efficacy and student success will also be explored.

Modern digital technologies allow students to engage in inquiry-based activities in topics that have traditionally been out of experimental reach, such as astronomy and particle physics. An expert-like understanding of a topic requires recognition and awareness of the different roles of formalisms, computer simulations, and physical experiments. Conceptual blending (also known as conceptual integration) is a framework for describing cognitive processes. We will illustrate how conceptual blending can be used to interpret how students make sense of the motion of stellar objects, as they explore them in an interactive whiteboard-based investigative group activity. Main findings include that students quickly accept the idea of being able to throw planets into orbit in the interactive computer environment. For consolidation of learning and for building an expert-like understanding, experiences from this playful activity and from everyday life have to be projected onto formal physics theory.

The effects of instructional reforms in university physics are typically evaluated through formative assessment, standardized concept inventories and/or attitude surveys. In addition, student feedback is collected by many departments, but reports of its use in course development are rare. At the University of Helsinki, Finland, student feedback has been regularly collected at fundamental physics courses since 2007. Over the years, feedback has proven to be an invaluable source of information for course development. It has revealed characteristics of physics courses and effects of instructional reforms hardly found by other means. Key factors for success are that all students have been motivated to give their considered opinions and feedback is solely used for the purposes of course development (and not e.g. for faculty promotions). In this talk, the feedback procedure will be presented along with examples of findings.

As part of a project to explore successful strategies for using studio methods, such as SCALE-UP, we are investigating attitudes that students possess and actions they take that bolster or hinder success in their studio-mode physics courses. We interviewed SCALE-UP physics instructors at two large-enrollment research universities to explore their perspectives on the student-level variables that influence students chances of excelling in their algebra-based studio-mode physics courses. We developed a coding scheme to characterize the beneficial and detrimental student qualities instructors observe and the actions instructors take to encourage beneficial student attitudes/behaviors and discourage detrimental ones. We present a snapshot of the coding scheme used and discuss common ideas about studio-mode physics student success identified by our participants.

This study investigates the effects of various uses of Learning Assistants (LAs) on student outcomes across over 20 LA Alliance member institutions. Over 5000 physics students and 29 instructors participated in the study using the LA Supported Student Outcomes (LASSO) online student evaluation system. The Force and Motion Concept Evaluation (FMCE), Force Concept Inventory (FCI), Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment (BEMA), and Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM) were used by over 40 different classes across the U.S. Our analysis links course-level information (e.g. how LAs are utilized) and average LA-student interaction time to course learning gains. We will report results from various institutional settings and discuss contextual effects on student outcomes.

One of teachers greatest tools in the classroom is questioning. It has long been theorized that higher level questioning leads to students developing a better understanding of the material but no one has examined the types of questions asked in physics classrooms in great detail. We used Blooms revised taxonomy to classify the questions asked by high school physics instructors and surveyed them on what they believe their questioning patterns to be. By analyzing the distribution of question types and the teachers self-perceived questioning patterns we take a first step to better understanding the use of questioning in physics classrooms.

When creating concept inventories, we usually write questions in clusters, each cluster corresponding to a particular concept. Do these clusters appear in the data generated when students take the concept inventories, and what does this tell us about student thinking? The physics education research community has often tackled this problem using factor analysis. Other recent work has modeled test result data as a bipartite network and applied community detection algorithms to identify clusters of questions. To better understand the differences between these methods, we hypothesize a model of how students answer questions inspired by the resource framework, use the model to simulate test results with known cluster structure, and compare the two methods' ability to recover the known cluster structure. Finally, we discuss implications of these results on how we should understand the way that students generate answers to test questions.

Creating high-quality problem diagrams consumes significant resources from both instructor and publisher, yet the benefit of problem diagrams has not been confirmed by research. Using the AB experiment functionality of the edX MOOC platform, we selected 12 problems where the diagram adds no critical information for problem solving, and studied the impact of adding/removing a diagram on both student correctness and problem solving behavior. We found that providing a diagram improved 1st attempt correct rate by merely 3% overall, but reduced the fraction of students drawing their own diagram by ~10% on half of the problems. On the other half, providing a diagram have no detectable impact on either correctness or behavior. Further analysis confirmed that except for the most spatially challenging problems, MOOC students are able to compensate for the loss of a diagram by drawing their own.

Large-scale assessment data from Texas Tech University yielded evidence that most students taught traditionally in large lecture classes with online homework and predominantly multiple choice question exams, when asked to answer free-response questions, did not support their answers with logical arguments grounded in physics concepts. Their answers indicated not only their lack of conceptual understanding, but their inability to apply even lower order thinking skills to solve a problem. While correct answers indicated evidence of lower level thinking skills, when coded by a rubric based on Blooms taxonomy, incorrect and partially correct answers indicated little or no evidence of the use of thinking skills at all. The free-response format, unlike other assessment formats, allowed assessment of both their conceptual understanding and their application of thinking skills, clearly pointing out weaknesses not revealed by other assessment instruments.

Research suggests that students benefit from peer interaction and active engagement. The quality and nature of these interactions is currently being explored. Students have been surveyed at regular intervals during the second semester of trigonometry-based introductory physics to determine the frequency and self-reported quality of interactions. These interactions can be with current or past students, tutors, and instructors. Our current research focuses on the metrics of Social Network Research in an effort to refine deeper research questions regarding success in the introductory sequence and the support system that student create during the two-semester physics sequence. These metrics include centrality of students as well as segmentation of groups.

Physics instructors obtain their educational activities from a variety of sources. They may invent the activities themselves, use activities that have been designed for them by other faculty in their department, or use published materials that can be purchased or downloaded. Over the last few decades, many published materials have been tested and shown to benefit students' conceptual understanding. We have analyzed some of these published physics activities and interviewed their designers in order to better understand the principles behind them. These principles are valuable for understanding the impact that physics activities have on students and for understanding non-published activities developed by individual instructors.

Preparing graduate teaching assistants (TAs) and undergraduate learning assistants (LAs) in Introductory Physics to facilitate discovery learning in labs and tutorials is a topic of intense interest in Physics Education Research. Our model for training TAs and LAs includes an overview of pedagogical theory, roleplays targeted at specific issues in active learning, and direct feedback from multiple teaching observations throughout the semester. The content of the roleplays and other activities emphasizes the importance of discourse, questioning, and eliciting student ideas by requiring the TAs and LAs to model those practices. We examine survey data from TAs and LAs and their students, and video data and field notes from training activities and teaching observations to consider the viability of our model as a method for preparing TAs and LAs to teach physics effectively. We also reflect on our training model for its potential to train future physics faculty members in student-centered learning.

This PER study investigates the order in which conceptual topics and laboratory exercises are presented in a high school physics classroom. By varying the order of presentation of conceptual material and labs, the researchers aimed to identify if student scores and growth on conceptual measures differed in the two contexts. We hypothesized that students learning with the guided inquiry model, in which laboratory exercises preceded conceptual lessons, would demonstrate higher scores and greater growth on objective measures of learning. We further hypothesized that these students would indicate a preference for learning via the guided inquiry model. We will discuss significant differences in group means in the two learning contexts. Results of student preference surveys will also be reported in order to evaluate student perceptions of the two instructional paradigms.

Students visual attention on conceptual physics tasks with diagrams can provide us insight into how multimodality hints affect students task performance on conceptual physics tasks. We conducted a 2 (visual hint or not) 2 (text hint or not) 2 (audio hint or not) full factorial experiment design. One hundred sixty-two subjects from a conceptual physics class were recruited to participate in individual clinical interviews with randomly assigned multimodal hints according to the condition. All of the interviews were video and audio recorded. An eye tracker was used to record the subjects eye movements. The data were analyzed to compare how the experimental conditions affected performance on conceptual physics tasks and their visual attention in relevant areas on the task diagram.

Transfer of learning is a valued educational goal, but it is usually hard to achieve. Visual cues and video solutions have been shown to facilitate this process. Students from an algebra-based physics class participated in our study. Each participant solved two different sets of tasks. In each set students solved one initial task, completed an intervention depending upon condition, and then solved a near transfer and far transfer task. Students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions. The visual cue condition completed four isomorphic training tasks with visual cues. The video solution condition was shown multimedia solutions of two isomorphic tasks. The third condition completed two isomorphic training tasks with visual cues and were shown one multimedia video solution. We compared the eye movements on the initial, near transfer and far transfer tasks in the three conditions.

Improving students problem-solving skills is a basic goal of many college-level introductory physics courses. At the University of Minnesota, investigators have developed computer programs designed to provide students with coaching to help them become better at solving problems in an introductory college physics course. As a physics instructor at Normandale Community College, I am participating in a study to test the feasibility of using this computer coach interface to modify existing coaches and create new coaches suitable for students enrolled in the introductory physics classes at Normandale and to assess their usability and educational impact with Normandale students. In this talk I will report on my initial experience with using C3PO: Customizable Computer Coaches for Physics Online to create and modify physics computing coaches.

Instructors often report apparent difficulties among introductory university physics students with mathematical skills and concepts normally taught in high school or earlier. As part of a systematic effort to identify and address such difficulties, we have begun to investigate skill levels with trigonometry, basic algebra, symbolic manipulation, and vector concepts, among students in algebra- and calculus-based introductory physics. We will present a summary of our initial results, and outline a strategy for addressing these difficulties within the context of physics classes themselves.

Science practices are an integral part of learning science. Over the course of the 2015-2016 school year, high school physics students, initially unfamiliar with an inquiry-based environment, engaged in ISLE labs that focus on the development of student scientific abilities. Based on the last years investigations, we know that factors such as time, ability type, student grouping, and instructor influence student development of scientific abilities. This year, we are continuing to examine student lab reports in order to better understand the process students go through when they write these reports. The revision history feature of the Google Documents provides insight into development of discourse as well as collaboration amongst students. We also continue to investigate differences in individual and group reports and students self-assessments and reflections of their progress in development of these different abilities.

As part of an ongoing effort to investigate the learning and teaching of bipolar junction transistor circuits (e.g., the common-emitter amplifier) in physics and engineering courses, we have begun to examine student understanding of ac biasing networks. These biasing networks are critical for signal processing via transistor circuits, yet the coverage of such networks in both courses and texts is typically sparse and frequently secondary to coverage of the amplifier circuits themselves. In this cross-disciplinary project, we have been examining the extent to which students are able to correctly predict the behavior of the biasing network under both dc and ac conditions. In this presentation, we will use specific examples to highlight the most prevalent conceptual and reasoning difficulties identified. Implications for instruction emerging from this investigation will also be discussed.

Learning quantum mechanics requires students to develop new conceptual understanding and mathematical skills, and to reason differently about the nature of systems (i.e. an electron is no longer a point-like particle). We present a broad view of our research in a Modern Physics course at CU Boulder where second-year physics and engineering students learn the foundations of quantum mechanics. In this work, we focus on classically unfamiliar or unusual cases, such as tunneling and delayed choice experiments, and look at the nature of student reasoning in these situations. We present both qualitative (recorded focus group discussions) and quantitative (conceptual and epistemological survey) data and demonstrate that students are capable of engaging in sophisticated reasoning about quantum phenomena. By explicitly attending to applications and interpretation within instruction, we foster an environment in which students negotiate and grapple with quantum concepts.

The Newtonian score representation of students understanding of force and motion concepts has been a standard index in quantitative studies on conceptual transformation. Whereas students proficiency before physics instruction is associated with learning gain, the robustness of novice views is attributed to learning inefficiency among low proficiency students. This study attempts to relate the inefficiency and the robustness of the primary commonsense conceptions by devising a noviceness index using a large number of students pre-test and post-test results on the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation. The results show that the proportion of change from novice responses to correct responses increased with an exponential regression curve, with R2 close to 1. The exponential rate of the transformation of a novice view could bring forth empirical data on other aspects of this transformation, such as what is involved in the rewiring of a neural network to build a new network.

We introduce a new tool for adoption by high school and college-level physics teachers who use a common assessment such as the Force Concept Inventory (FCI). The tool uses a spreadsheet application to create a simple matrix that identifies the percentage of students that who select each possible pre-/post-test answer combination on each question of the diagnostic exam. From this, it determines changes in students understanding of concepts and common misconceptions. For those students who selected the wrong answer to a question on both of the pre-/post-tests, we also determine whether they are moving toward a better wrong answer. Feedback from the tool allows instructors to close the loop on assessment and tailor instruction in an informed way.

We investigate student difficulties with degenerate perturbation theory in quantum mechanics by administering free-response and multiple-choice questions and conducting individual interviews with advanced students. We find that students display many common difficulties related to this topic.

We will discuss the development and evaluation of the QuILT. We thank the National Science Foundation for support.

The PER community has produced 50+ research-based assessments (RBAs) which evaluate the effectiveness of different teaching methods, covering diverse physics topics (both introductory and upper-level) as well as beliefs about the nature of physics, problem solving, lab skills etc. Results on these tests show that PER-based teaching methods lead to dramatic improvements in students learning, so assessment can act as a gateway drug to better teaching. However, physics faculty often struggle with knowing which assessments are available and which to use in their course. We have written a resource letter in which we discuss the details of each research-based assessment, including the course-level, content, purpose, level of research validation and implementation details. We also compare relevant assessments and give recommendations on when to use each assessment. In our talk, we will give an overview of the categories of assessments, paying particular attention to those that are less well known.

Over the past several years the Physics Education Group at the University of Washington has been working to probe the difficulties students encounter in junior-level electrodynamics courses.

As part of a larger, multi-institutional effort to investigate and assess the development of student reasoning skills in the context of scaffolded physics instruction, we have designed and administered new tasks in order to examine student ability to reason in different directions in introductory calculus-based physics courses. In these reasoning reversal tasks, two different versions of a physics problem are randomly administered to students in the course. In one version, students are asked to predict how a modification to an experimental setup will change the outcome of the experiment; in the other version, students are asked to infer the modification to the experimental setup that led to a specified change in the outcome of the experiment. In this talk, we will present preliminary results from these reasoning reversal tasks.

This talk will present results from our attempts at improving student understanding of vector fields and the physical interpretation of vector derivatives.

Several studies have demonstrated the utility of epistemic games in understanding problem-solving behavior in physics. Many researchers acknowledge the issue of grain-size as a challenge when identifying epistemic games in data, but few papers discuss games with various grain sizes.

We identify distinct layers of epistemic games in the episode and look for relations between these layers.

Whether students are studying classical physics or cutting edge physics, many of the same principles apply. For example, the conservation of momentum is a time-honored classical topic that is absolutely necessary to understand the products of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider.

In 2012, the National Research Council released A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas. This report synthesized the literature on how students learn science into three dimensions that should be blended together in instruction, curriculum, and assessment. This "three-dimensional learning" is the basis for the Next Generation Science Standards and researchers have recently made calls to bring it to higher education as well. We have developed the Three-Dimensional Learning Assessment Protocol (3D-LAP), which can characterize assessments in introductory science courses as aligning (or not) with scientific practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas. In this talk, I apply the 3D-LAP to some commonly used concept inventories in physics to characterize their alignment with the three dimensions from the Framework. I will explore the potential utility of these concept inventories in the era of the Next Generation Science Standards.

As part of developing a comprehensive package of classroom materials for radiation literacy, the Inquiry into Radioactivity (IiR) project has drafted a Radiation Conceptual Evaluation (Rad CE). This instrument detects major problematic categories of student thinking such as the "substance-like view" of radiation, and ionizing radiation as waves. Students with the substance-like view think of radiation as "bad stuff" that is emitted from radioactive objects and contaminates other objects when it gets on them, making them radioactive in turn. Students with this view typically do not distinguish radiation from the condition of being radioactive. Pre and post-testing using the Rad CE at two different universities indicate that nearly all nonscience majors begin the IiR course with the substance-like view, but gradually transition to a "particles-in-motion" view over time. We compare data from both universities and draw implications for teaching radioactivity.

Past findings show large differences in student ability to use, and reason with, certain graphed data. Namely, many students incorrectly assume there must be dependence between the axes of any graph whether or not the data suggests a relation and whether or not a controlled experiment was done. In addition, students have similar difficulties reasoning with multivariable data displayed on a graph in multiple trend-lines. A majority of the errors made are consistent with a failure to properly control variables and/or reasoning illogically about the data. We developed and pilot tested two different one-hour group work activities to improve student understanding. One activity was laboratory based and focused on control of variables and experimentation. The other was recitation based and focused on logical reasoning and data manipulation. Results show the relative effectiveness of the activities and suggest interesting facts about the importance of logical reasoning vs. control of variables when working with graphed data.

Prior research suggests that students who demonstrate conceptual knowledge on one task often fail to apply consistent thinking on closely related tasks. This is consistent with the dual-process theory of reasoning that suggests that some students tend to focus on surface features that often elicit intuitive ideas. As such, these students tend to provide answers based on their first reactions or gut feelings. We applied a paired-question methodology, in which screening and target questions required the application of the same concepts and skills. Three versions of screening-target sequences were designed in the context of friction. The sequences only differed in the level of abstractness that describe setups presented in the screening questions. The impact of these differences on student performance on the target question was examined. Results from introductory algebra-based physics class will be presented and discussed.

Gausss law is a fixture in introductory physics classes in part because the reasoning skills and fundamental physics knowledge required for its application represent important course goals. We have found that students struggle to apply Gausss law to conceptual questions as well as typical end-of-chapter problems, even after coverage in lecture and the relevant sections of Tutorials in Introductory Physics(1). To address persistent difficulties we are modifying tutorial curriculum to reduce the number of examples and emphasize the development of a conceptual framework around flux and Gausss law. The goal is to improve student performance on both conceptual questions and typical calculation questions. A summary of the student difficulties uncovered, details of modifications to the established curriculum, and preliminary results will be presented.

In a teacher professional development meeting of the MainePSP, teachers were asked a question about potential energy and then to discuss why students might give a particular response to it. Collectively, they came up with a rich, nuanced description of student reasoning, touching on multiple ways of thinking about energy, and how these might affect student responses. Where PD organizers (...the talk authors) had predicted three or four, teachers came up with six explanations of a particular answer. These included ideas in the literature (related to time, effort, and work, for example) and ideas not in the literature (a wonderfully compelling reverse deficit model of energy). We find that bringing teachers together and sharing student data within a facilitated community lets teachers arrive at surprising insights about how their students think about energy.

Many studies have shown that students often struggle to interpret and generate graphs of various physical quantities. This can be seen in students responses to the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation. When analysing consistency on questions asking students to select graphs of force vs. time to accompany a described motion compared to questions asking them to choose verbal descriptions of forces, we have previously used consistency plots to show that students are more likely to improve on the graph questions than the natural language questions. This suggests that students may have developed a formal understanding of the relationship between force and motion but do not apply it when reasoning about situations related to their daily lives. We expand on these results by incorporating data from multiple colleges and universities and show how these results relate to other analyses of the data.

Instructional labs are an important element of undergraduate introductory physics. Many lab activities require students to construct graphs of their data and interpret their results, connecting their lab experience to underlying physics concepts. We investigated students' construction and interpretation of linear best-fit graphs in the context of two lab activities. Students' graphs were evaluated for overall quality as well as for the quality of the best-fit line. We then interviewed students to determine the strategies used in graph construction and fitting, and to assess student understanding of the meaning of the graph. Our results indicate that undergraduate introductory physics students can successfully construct best-fit linear graphs while struggling to interpret graphs according to the physical concept under investigation. Furthermore we found, perhaps surprisingly, that the most challenging aspect of graph construction for students was establishing a correct and useful scale.

In this presentation, we focus on students sense-making with a graphical representation commonly used in quantum mechanics textbooks; that of overlaid potential energy and wavefunction plots in the context of quantum well(s) and barriers. Previous research has pointed to a conflation of the energy and wavefunction axes as leading to common student difficulties in understanding phenomena such as tunneling. The existence of this difficulty has influenced QMCS survey items and design choices in several PhET simulations. We add to this research by investigating how students use and interact with this graphical representation while sense-making. Through fine-timescale analysis of video data from clinical interviews with engineering majors in a modern physics course, we document that the inscription can play both communicative and generative roles in the student's reasoning. We report the different ways in which the inscription gets embedded in students reasoning and potential instructional implications.

We recorded pre-service physics teachers learning about the physics of solar cells. Using a knowledge-in-pieces theoretical framework, we analyze their interactions in order to make inferences about the elements of prior knowledge they call upon as they build understanding of how these devices function. Of special interest are the instances when a student makes a significant conceptual breakthrough. We find that students who combine different aspects of their prior knowledge in specific ways may be more likely to make breakthroughs. We will discuss what instructors can do to prime learners to combine knowledge in productive ways so they are better able to achieve these breakthroughs.

When students work on physics problems, certain problem features may cue specific lines of reasoning. In particular, salient distracting features (SDFs) are surface, situational, or contextual features of a problem that frequently cue incorrect lines of reasoning and inhibit the exploration of more productive reasoning approaches. A potential approach for addressing SDF-related reasoning difficulties is to target and enhance student metacognition. In the second semester of the calculus-based introductory physics sequence at the University of Maine, we developed and administered a flexible, web-based instructional intervention designed to help students construct metacognitive knowledge about productive reflection on the role of SDFs in influencing reasoning. In the intervention, students are asked to synthesize contrasting cases in which hypothetical students reflect upon physics problems containing SDFs. Preliminary data and emerging findings will be presented. *This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. DUE-1245313 and DUE-0962805.

The ability to flexibly transform between different representations (e.g., from mathematical to graphical representations) of the same concept is a hallmark of expertise. This ability is often lacking in many introductory students as evidenced by the lack of consistency in students representations (i.e., students construct two representations for the same concept in the same situation that are not consistent with one another). In this study, we asked students to construct two representations for the electric field for a situation involving spherical symmetry (charged conducting sphere surrounded by charged conducting spherical shell). This type of problem has been found to result in many students constructing representations that are not consistent with one another. Here, we present findings from individual interviews with students which suggest that students lack of consistency may partly be attributed to the type of knowledge that the graphical and mathematical contexts trigger. Using the epistemic games framework terminology, the two representations students are asked to construct (mathematical vs. graphical) may lead them to play two different epistemic games. We discuss how students epistemological framing and beliefs may contribute to their lack of representational consistency.

There has been an increasing push for the refinement of curricula in university level algebra-based and calculus-based physics classes to focus on scientific reasoning skills. There are nine recognized domains of scientific reasoning, and this study focused on the causal reasoning domain. Quantitative data were gathered from selected items given as part of the Inventory of Scientific Thinking and Reasoning (iSTAR) assessment at the beginning and end of two semesters. The focus of this analysis was to identify student difficulties in making causal judgements. Initial results from the data suggested that students entangle forward and reverse causality statements; they often selected a forward causal statement "X causes Y" and a reverse causal statement "Y causes X" simultaneously to explain some observed result.

Physics instructors generally expect students to think about the correctness and reflect on the meanings of their answers. This answer evaluation process may include a variety of considerations, including checking units, looking at limiting cases, and thinking about the reasonableness of numbers. In order to encourage answer evaluation, instructors explicitly prompt for it in class assignments. We examine students responses to such a prompt on homework and exam problems in a large enrollment first term calculus-based physics course. We will discuss the distribution of strategies students used, student performance with these strategies, and the extent to which the development of answer evaluation skills was supported throughout the course.

Improving students skills in solving synthesis problems, which are problems requiring the application of multiple concepts such as energy conservation and kinematics, is typically a key instructional goal. We have previously found that students struggle with some synthesis problems more than their single-concept counterparts in part because of difficulty recognizing all the relevant concepts or that multiple concepts are needed. Analogical reasoning, which involves practice activities that guide students through comparisons of the deep structure of physics problems, is a promising technique for helping students recognize relevant concepts in novel problems. We report on a couple experiments testing simple implementations of analogical reasoning and show that these activities can be effective in improving student performance on synthesis problems. However, we also show evidence that these activities may not be as useful in cases where concept recognition is a less significant bottleneck.

Students who demonstrate correct conceptual knowledge and formal reasoning approaches on one physics question often abandon these approaches in favor of more intuitive reasoning on an isomorphic question. The heuristic-analytic theory of reasoning suggests that the intuitive approaches used by these students stem from the heuristic process and are cued by salient, distracting features of the isomorphic problems. This apparent failure to engage the analytic process productively may stem from a lack of metacognition. We speculate that the students who continue to use formal reasoning on the isomorphic problems tend to be more reflective, analytical thinkers. In order to investigate this possibility, we have been using the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) in conjunction with a pair of isomorphic questions to examine the extent to which students reflection abilities impact performance.

Representations (i.e. graphs, equations, pictures) are the foundational tools that students use to understand and solve physics problems. This study aims to understand the purpose with which students use particular representations. In the Modeling Instruction courses, representation use is a primary focus with explicit class time spent on introducing, practicing, coordinating, and applying multiple representations. Consequently, we conducted pre/post think-aloud, problem-solving interviews with groups of students in the Modeling Instruction Electricity and Magnetism (MI-E&M;) course. In each recorded interview, students were asked to solve three physics problems, which varied by context (mechanics and E&M;), difficulty, and familiarity with the topic to show the breadth of how students use representations when problem solving. From video analysis and coding, we will present the common themes and purposes with which students use various representations.

As our classrooms become more active and collaborative, we need to consider ways that our assessments can take on the same active and collaborative spirit that our classes have. One way that has come into practice is through the use of group exams. We hypothesize that student groupings are embedded within exam response data giving us an assessment of our students' social profiles. This makes group exam response data an untapped resource that can tell us more about our students than their score on an exam. Using a duplicate exam format, we are developing a method for analyzing group formation for a particular exam using the framework of network analysis. This method will be compared to self-reported student grouping data for verification. Looking forward, we will consider questions such as, Who do I need to work harder to include in the class? and Who might make a good LA?

Peer grading of student work has been used extensively in large-enrollment courses, but this evaluative practice has not yet been deeply explored in the context of student work submitted as videos. Georgia Tech has run three semesters of an introductory mechanics course in which students were required to create lab reports as videos and post them online. We investigate student grading behaviors by comparing students ratings of peer-produced lab reports with the students online (clickstream) interactions with those lab reports during the grading process. We discuss particular features of the peer-grading process which may influence student ratings and engagement.

Students in research-and-inquiry-based physics courses tend to feel uneasy with the lack of answers from the professor or textbook. Years of traditional schooling teach students to seek answers outside of their own reasoning. Also, students tend to bring to our classrooms unproductive views of science as being about "right answers" and they discount sense-making. Despite our efforts to encourage students to take risks and rely on their wits, many students feel unease about their ideas because they are not from authorities. Martin Schwartz addressed a similar concern among scientists in his essay "The importance of stupidity in scientific research". In this article Schwartz frames ignorance or stupidity as the essential driver of scientific research. We have investigated changes in student affect that result from reading this article as a homework assignment and find that, while students often misunderstand the point of the article, their feelings about the course improve considerably. *The Inquiry into Radioactivity Project has been supported by NSF DUE grant 0942699.

Instruments that measure students attitudes and epistemological beliefs about physics often assume implicitly that physics is monolithic. That is, while there are multiple dimensions to student attitudes, physics itself is treated as a single discipline. We administered a survey in modern physics courses for engineering students, with modified CLASS (Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey) survey items in which physics was changed to classical physics and quantum physics, and found significant splits between students self-reported attitudes toward classical and quantum physics, both pre- and post-instruction. Specifically, students display greater evidence of real-world connections and problem-solving sophistication with classical than with quantum physics. We also found that, under some conditions, quantum physics instruction was associated with a pre-/post-shift in attitudes toward classical physics.

Theories developed by Tinto and Nora identify academic performance, learning gains, and student involvement in learning communities as important facets of student engagement that support student persistence. Collaborative learning environments, such as those employed in the Modeling Instruction (MI) introductory physics course, are considered especially important. Due to the inherently social nature of collaborative learning, we examine student social interactions in the classroom using Network Analysis methods to analyze a survey administered periodically in class. We then calculate centrality, a family of measures that quantify how connected or "central" a particular student is within the classroom social network. Building on previous work indicating relationships between classroom interactions and performance, we investigate this relationship further to better understand how student engagement manifests in the context of a large-scale MI course at Florida International University.

At Swarthmore College, we recently introduced a first-semester Introductory Physics for the Life Sciences (IPLS) course that draws on authentic biological examples relating to kinematics, Newtonian mechanics, and thermodynamics. Because the course is offered only every other year, we are uniquely situated to compare the experiences of those students who take the IPLS course to a similar set of students who take a traditional first-semester introductory physics course that covers the same topics but does not foreground biological connections. In this talk we draw on conceptual and attitudinal survey data, as well as a series of case-study interviews, to describe the conceptual, epistemological, and affective differences that we observe between the two student populations. We identify the features of the IPLS experience that were most salient to students, and suggest how particular course structures may have been especially important in supporting students ability to do well in the IPLS environment.

This PER study focuses on university students in the physics content and pedagogy course, Energy and Interactions (formerly Physics and Everyday Thinking). By design, this course prepares future teachers and fulfills an undergraduate science requirement, thus enrolling students from a wide range of experiences and comfort with science content, from confident to struggling. The course is driven by students as they co-construct principles from lab-based evidence. This study asks how students describe and position themselves as learners in this environment, and how their positioning changes as they engage with different kinds of activities. We analyze students weekly reflections and conceptual assessment scores. Preliminary results indicate that students are at first resistant to this student-driven model, but quickly start reporting feeling more confident in their abilities and reasoning, and begin valuing co-constructing knowledge with peers. We will present results and make inferences about how course components influence this shift in positioning.

In this talk, we analyze shifts in students identity trajectories as undergraduate physics majors participating in their first research experiences. Students in the study participated in an elective seminar in which they were paired with graduate student and faculty mentors on physics research projects and participated in a weekly discussions about research. Using video data from student interviews, classroom observations, research mentor interviews, and research observations, we study the development of students identity trajectories. Relational dynamics between students and other members of the physics community contributed to the legitimization and delegitimization of students physics identities. We highlight shifts in how students positioned themselves, and were positioned by others as more and less central members of the physics community. Finally, we draw out connections between student trajectories, and discuss implications for future research and programmatic design.

As part of their upper-division electromagnetic fields course, students work in small groups to solve physics and mathematics problems during class. We categorize their epistemological framing along two orthogonal axes -- physics to math and algorithmic to conceptual -- to determine how shifts in students' framing interact with the instructor's framing and the problem at hand. Drawing from observational video data of classroom interactions, we characterize framing shifts over 50 episodes throughout two iterations of the course, seeking both diversity of student responses and diversity in problem type and duration. In this talk, we present our framework and some preliminary results.

When using ad hoc student groups for group exams, how do students group themselves? Are there clear preferences for grouping by sex, ability in the course, or years in university? In courses with multiple opportunities to form these ad hoc groups, do these preferences change as the course proceeds?

P3 is a transformed introductory mechanics course at Michigan State University that focuses on the development of scientific practices. The design team, as part of the P3 course design made explicit attempts to assess learning goals that can often be perceived as being a part of the hidden curriculum or considered difficult to assess (for example: learning to work productively in a group). This assessment is in the form of formative feedback with students receiving a numbered grade and reflective commentary based around their interactions in the classroom for the week. In this presentation, case studies formed from student interviews conducted at the beginning and end of the semester are discussed to highlight how the formative feedback received, effected changes in student interactions in class. The presentation also highlights students reflections on the feedback and how the effect it had on them changed over time.

The successful implementation of mastery-style online homework into our preparatory mechanics course has been a long-term project, currently in its second year. By requiring students to perfect a single unit of defined competencies before moving on to its successive unit (with intervening narrated animated solutions for instructional support), this homework delivery method replaced traditional immediate feedback online homework for the class of about 500 students. After the first year of data collection and analysis, significant revisions were made to the systems delivery, content, and messaging. The impact of these changes and second year data will be presented.

In order to evaluate the relative effectiveness of different question formats and levels of interaction during computer-based practice, students from two introductory-level mechanics classes were trained on the concepts of force and motion as part of one of four different training conditions. The training conditions varied the format of student responses (short answer, natural language versus multiple choice format) and the level of interaction in the feedback provided (a single, provided explanation versus constructive follow-up questions). Overall, the natural language format with follow-up dialog provided the largest gains over control, with retention over a month after training. In addition, we see some evidence that the effectiveness of the different formats varies based on initial student knowledge.

Students preparing for physics exams must make decisions on what material to study, how to best prepare, and estimate their preparedness. Previous research has demonstrated that low performing students tend to over predict their learning and preparedness. Research has shown that simplifying the reading level in texts leads to gains in comprehension as well as larger gains in confidence in comprehension. We present data where low performing students in an introductory mechanics course completed an animated video solution intervention. Participants completed a pre-test, viewed video solutions, then completed a post-test. Confidence judgements were made after attempting each problem and after viewing the video solutions. Data will show whether or not students are able to learn from viewing video solutions for previously solved problems. We also present data about students prediction of their performance. We discuss the educational implications of our findings.

First-year university physics students (N = 42) were engaged in an open-ended laboratory module of a thermodynamics course, with a focus on understanding a chosen phenomenon or the principle of laboratory apparatus, such as thermal radiation or a heat pump. In the practical investigation, students had at their disposal handheld infrared (IR) cameras. Students interaction with the laboratory exercises and oral presentations were video recorded, and three episodes were selected for qualitative analysis. Students used IR cameras in the investigation of interaction of thermal radiation with matter, e.g. metals, glass or whiteboard surfaces. For instance, the function of a glass window is to let through visible light, but reflect radiation in the IR range for insulation purposes. Students were intrigued to find black- and white-painted surfaces to have similar thermal emissivity. As an implication, IR cameras were found to be useful tools in open practical thermodynamics exercises.

Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) is an instructional strategy involving feedback from students on pre-lecture activities in order to design in-class activities to build on the continuing feedback from students. We investigate the effectiveness of a JiTT approach, which included in-class concept tests using clickers in an upper-division quantum mechanics course. We analyze student performance on pre-lecture reading quizzes, in-class clicker questions answered individually, and clicker questions answered after group discussion, and compare those performances with open-ended retention quizzes administered after all instructional activities on the same concepts. In general, compared to the reading quizzes, student performance improved in individual concept tests administered using clickers after lecture focusing on student difficulties found via electronic feedback. The performance on the group concept tests administered after the individual concept tests and on retention quizzes also showed improvement. We discuss possible reasons for the improvement in performance from pre-lecture quizzes to post-lecture concept tests and from individual to group concept tests and retention quizzes.

As part of a project to explore the varying success of studio-mode courses, we are investigating institutional barriers that may lead to different student outcomes. As institutions adopt new instructional models, some may embrace the change more slowly, such that students have the option to take courses in multiple formats. We explore the pathways of students through the introductory physics sequence at two universities that have transformed some of their sections into studios, such that students may take the first semester course in either lecture-mode or studio-mode and then choose to stay with that mode or switch for the second semester. We report on correlations between first semester student outcomes on their choice to switch or stay and subsequent outcomes in the second semester as measured by conceptual and attitudinal surveys.

At Colorado School of Mines, we teach introductory physics using a hybrid lecture-studio model. In studio, students are split into groups of three to work through scaffolded problems and experiments. We want to know whether heterogeneous or homogenous group structures yield the most effective learning in our particular context. Each group structure has its own set of advantages (e.g., diversity of understandings and skills vs. ease of communication) and disadvantages (e.g., difficulty of communication vs. potential lack of understandings and skills). To explore the answer to this question, we assigned half of each studio class to groups with mixed physics proficiency and gender, and the other half to groups with matched physics proficiency and gender. We evaluate the performance of each group type according to the students scores and responses on the FMCE, common course exams, the CLASS, and an internal survey about their studio groups.

I will report on an experiment to implement a specifications grading* approach to assessment in a large-enrollment (130 students) introductory algebra-based physics course at California State University, Chico. In specifications grading, criteria for adequate performance need to be clearly specified, and all criteria are graded pass/fail. In adapting this assessment approach to the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) philosophy, I created homework and exam questions that that tested different (sometimes overlapping) clusters of scientific abilities. Students needed to perform adequately on all the specified scientific abilities in order to pass that particular question. This allowed for a more process-focused approach to assessment while still emphasizing key physics content. I will report on the effectiveness of this approach to assessment as gauged by quantitative shifts in students attitudes and gains in conceptual understanding as well as qualitative data from student interviews.

In discussion sections of a large, introductory physics course, a pair of studies compare two instructional strategies for teaching Faradays law: having students (i) explain a set of contrasting cases or (ii) apply and build on previously learned concepts. We show that contrasting cases not only lead to better performance on subsequent Faradays law questions, but also prepare students to better learn related topics, such as Lenzs law. We argue that early exposure to contrasting cases better focuses student attention on a key feature: change in magnetic flux. Importantly, the benefits of contrasting cases are enhanced for students who did not first attend a Faradays law lecture, suggesting that being told the answer can circumvent the benefits of its discovery. These studies illustrate an experimental approach for understanding how the structure of classroom activities affects learning and performance outcomes, a first step toward design principles for effective instructional materials.

Even though SCALE-UP algebra-based physics classes show no significant increase in FCI gains over traditional classes, SCALE-UP intervention shows a significant improvement in CLASS favorable scores for both Conceptual Understanding and Problem Solving categories.

The vector concept is used in physics instruction beginning in the introductory level. While initial encounters with vectors are firmly grounded in experience, (e.g., a displacement vector in two- or three-dimensional space, with magnitude and a direction), the vector concept grows to include far more abstract ideas. As part of an NSF-supported research and curriculum development project, we have studied student reasoning across several upper-division physics courses, including mathematical methods. For this presentation, we describe theoretical and empirical views of the development and expansion of the vector concept, with examples of student responses and a discussion of implications for instruction.

Students are often asked to construct qualitative reasoning chains during scaffolded, research-based physics instruction. As part of a multi-institutional effort to investigate and assess the development of student reasoning skills in physics, we have been designing tasks that probe the extent to which students can create and evaluate reasoning chains. In one task, students are provided with correct reasoning elements (i.e., true statements about the physical situation as well as correct concepts and mathematical relationships) and are asked to assemble them into an argument that they can use to answer a specified physics problem. In this talk, the task will be described in detail and preliminary results will be presented.

As part of a broader study on student thinking about mathematics in the undergraduate physics curriculum, we report on students ideas about coordinate systems in the upper division. Early evidence suggests that upper-division physics students struggle to answer conceptual and pictorial questions requiring the use of Cartesian and non-Cartesian coordinate systems. Specifically, students have difficulty identifying the motion of objects using plane polar coordinates. Not recognizing that both radial displacement and polar angle change with respect to time for motion along non-circular paths is a specific example of this difficulty. We report findings from one-on-one interviews that used a think-aloud protocol designed to shed light on student thinking within this domain.

While there has been a large body of work investigating the effectiveness of scaffolded, researched-based physics instruction, much less is known about the development of students reasoning abilities in these instructional environments. As part of a larger collaborative project, we have been examining the ability of students to construct qualitative reasoning chains. In particular, we have been designing and implementing tasks to assess the extent to which introductory physics students are able to logically follow and characterize hypothetical student reasoning in a variety of physics contexts. In one task, for example, students are asked to infer the conclusions that would be drawn from different lines of reasoning articulated by hypothetical students. In this presentation, we will discuss the development of such tasks and share preliminary results.

As part of an effort to examine students understanding of the structure of non-Cartesian coordinate systems and the differential elements associated with these systems when using vector calculus in electricity and magnetism (E&M;), students in junior E&M; were interviewed in pairs. In one task, students were asked to determine differential length and volume elements for an unconventional spherical coordinate system. While all pairs eventually arrived at the correct differential elements, some students unsuccessfully attempted to reason by recalling and/or mapping from elements in spherical or Cartesian coordinates, only to recognize their error later when checking their work. We have documented several ideas that students use, and certain actions they undertake, while working through the task. Across-interview comparisons allow for characterization of student successes and difficulties in terms of whether these ideas are present and how they are grouped and ordered.

We present data from sophomore and junior-level quantum mechanics courses to illustrate some of the errors that students encounter in using complex numbers.

It has been shown that students encounter significant reasoning difficulties when interpreting and applying multi-variable expressions. For example, students often argue that because the frequency of a periodic wave is expressed in terms of wavelength and propagation speed, the frequency must change when the speed changes. Similarly, many students think that the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor will change if the potential difference between its plates is varied. In this talk, we report on an investigation of the extent to which problematic reasoning approaches are related to (1) the level of abstractness of a presented situation and (2) the specific features of the task itself.

As part of a multi-institution collaboration, we are examining students multi-step, qualitative reasoning in physics. An important part of this work is developing methods for disentangling conceptual understanding from reasoning. In this talk, we present and analyze responses on tasks in which students apply energy concepts to simple situations. One such task involves a hand moving a book with changing speed through a uniform gravitational field. Most students struggle to coordinate the energy input (work done by the hand) and the energy changes (changes in kinetic energy and in gravitational potential energy).

The national need for a knowledgeable and diverse STEM workforce is a powerful motive for improving physics education and conducting physics education research. However, there is a need for coherent models for workforce training. Some STEM advocates believe training is the responsibility of higher education, while others see industry playing an integral and cooperative role. We studied career preparation using 30 semi-structured interviews with new hires and their managers in physics-related careers. We developed a data-driven model for where learning happens and how it transfers into the workplace, and found that essential learning occurs inside and outside of the classroom (e.g., hobbies, internships). We compared our model with others suggested in literature. Workforce development advocates would benefit from a holistic training model that encompasses higher education and industry. Further, physics departments would benefit from understanding the broad range of opportunities they can offer students for their future careers.

The Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshop (NFW) does a good job of inspiring participants to try evidence-based teaching practices, but participants often face significant barriers to innovation that cause them to eventually revert to traditional instruction. Faculty Online Learning Communities (FOLCs) are year-long, virtual faculty communities designed to support participants after attending the in-person NFW. FOLCs provides participants with a community of peers and ongoing support to make it more likely that they will overcome barriers to improved teaching. In this presentation, we will analyze one FOLC communication channel: a private online message board. We will discuss how factors like the frequency and type of comments change over time as FOLC participants generate mutual trust and how these discussions support the learning that takes place during the synchronous FOLC meetings.

A Faculty Online Learning Community (FOLC) is a follow-up experience for participants in the Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshops. FOLC cohorts, composed of faculty members from around the country, meet biweekly by video for discussion with guest speakers and with each other about implementing active learning in their classrooms. Between meetings, members continue conversations, post materials, and ask for advice in a private social media group. FOLCs are intended to support faculty in meeting the challenges of classroom reform, which can be substantial even after attending the New Faculty Workshop. As a secondary benefit, FOLC cohorts have also proved to be a sounding board and discussion space for a broader range of issues facing junior faculty. Here we describe the ongoing development of the cohort formation process, with a particular focus on how recruitment and community-building efforts have evolved during the project.

Faculty often become motivated to try research-based instructional strategies (RBIS) after attending professional development workshops, but they are often underprepared to succeed in using RBIS [1]. In order to further explore the outcomes of faculty professional development, we analyze video-recordings of facultys interactions during the Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshop. We select workshop episodes using our Real-time Professional Development Observation Tool, which allows us to identify instances where faculty members are voicing their ideas and collaborating with each other. We consider how workshop leaders design decisions seem to influence facultys engagement, e.g., how faculty take up workshop instructions, make sense of workshop activities, share and elaborate on their ideas, and justify their arguments. Lastly, we discuss the potential implications of these findings for facultys future teaching practice.

During past decades, computers have evolved from useful lab instruments to necessary problem solvers. Computation has become indispensable, interrelated to both theory and experiment, as a third methodology for solving scientific and engineering problems. By comparison, its effects on undergraduate education have been large in a few enclaves, spotty in others, and somewhere nearly nil. At least a decade of research on recent graduates with physics bachelor degrees has concluded this is a significant problem. Until now there has been no comprehensive assessment of departmental uses of computation, institutional environments for its integration into courses, personnel resources to effect such change, and local understanding of instructional methods helpful to its efficacy for learning physics. This survey is now completed. We report initial results in the context of computational curricular experiences, departmental resources and plans that the survey was designed to assess; complete details will follow at the 2017 winter meeting.

Instruction that attends to and takes up the substance of what students are saying and doing or responsive instruction has the potential to transform learners participation in the practices of science, support learner agency and voice, and promote equitable participation in the classroom, while preserving the conceptual gains our field has so long prized.

Professional development workshops are a primary mechanism used to help physics faculty improve their teaching, and draw in many instructors every year. Although workshops serve a critical role in changing instruction within our community, we rarely assess them through careful consideration of how they engage faculty. In order to encourage a shift towards more reflective, research-informed professional development, we have developed an observation tool, the Real-Time Professional Development Observation Tool (R-PDOT), to document the form and focus of faculty's engagement during workshops. During this talk, I will describe the development of the R-PDOT and introduce example R-PDOT data from sessions at the Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshop. We intend this tool to serve as a catalyst for workshop leaders critical reflection and a stepping stone for future research on faculty professional development.

Supplemental Instruction (SI) is a program developed to target gateway courses with low passing rates. Students in these courses have the option to attend regular sessions outside of lecture where they are guided through problem solving and learning through group work. Each session is led by an SI leader, a student who has done well in the course and has applied for the position. Because student success is the primary goal of the program, much of the research focuses on student success. However, SI leaders also learn and grow significantly as a result of participating in the program. In this study, we have conducted longitudinal interviews with SI leaders in STEM disciplines to examine their experience in the program. We will present findings about the SI leaders ideas about teaching and learning, their growth as content experts, and professionals in their fields.

We have facilitated Departmental Action Teams (DATs) in several departments as part of a change effort to improve undergraduate STEM education at a large research-intensive university. A DAT is a working group focused on addressing a broad-scale educational issue in a sustained, ongoing fashion. DATs consist primarily of faculty members from a single department, but may also include undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and staff. DATs are externally facilitated; the facilitators act as catalysts for change by providing DAT participants with expertise in education research and institutional change, logistical support, connections with related work across campus, and a functional process for achieving their goals. Through an analysis of DAT meeting minutes and focus groups, we identify the specific facilitation techniques that helped the DATs succeed and categorize them into goals, process, and support. We discuss these techniques to provide practical guidance for the facilitation of DATs and other similar groups.

In this talk, we analyze the development of students' identity trajectories as undergraduate physics majors participating in their first research experiences. Students in the study participated in an elective seminar in which they were paired with graduate student and faculty mentors on physics research projects and participated in weekly discussions about research. Using video data from student interviews, classroom observations, mentor interviews, and research observations, we study how students' research experiences and their experiences in the classroom community impact their identities. Our analysis draws on sociocultural theories of learning to study how positional dynamics between students and other members of the physics community contribute to the legitimization and delegitimization of students' physics identities. In particular, we attend to how research group environments and a reflective classroom community provide unique opportunities for these interactions.

The National Science Foundations IUSE:EHR (Improving Undergraduate STEM Education) Program is now over three years old. This presentation will describe the characteristics of the awards presently in the physics & astronomy portfolio. Awards will be described based upon a) general characteristics (duration, total funding, PI rank, type of institution, etc.), b) applicability (intended audience, level, and arena of implementation), c) nature of project (educational research, practical implementation, or both), and d) pedagogical focus (curriculum, STEM recruitment, STEM retention, information collection, and tools and/or skills development). General trends and exemplars will be identified as well as voids in the portfolio. Understanding what has been funded will help attendees design future proposals that will make innovative contributions to the portfolio.

In this exploratory study, we investigate how tapping into students experience, expertise, and interest in music and sound supports learning about waves using musical synthesizers. Waves are at the heart of modern physics, but students have great difficulty understanding basic wave properties, even after instruction. Research shows that students who explore physics phenomena in contexts they are familiar with and interested in enlist their prior experiences as productive resources for reasoning about physics and are more likely to spend the time to achieve expert-like understandings of complex phenomena. We will present preliminary findings from our investigation.

Our group has incorporated peer review of video lab reports into several flipped and online-only introductory physics courses at Georgia Tech, and in previous work we have demonstrated an improvement in student-expert grading agreement over the course of the semester. This talk presents our qualitative findings stemming from a series of interviews conducted with our latest group of laboratory participants from the summer of 2016. We discuss student-reported attitudes toward peer review and scientific communication, and describe the features of the peer review process which students considered most salient. In particular, we find that the interviewed students learned very quickly during the peer review process that the instructors were harsher or more critical graders than they themselves were, and so developed a practice of routinely revising downward the ratings they assigned to their peers.

Mindset is a well-studied area of the psychology literature associated with Dweck and colleagues. Mindset research focuses on beliefs about the nature of intelligence: is it an unchangeable entity a person either possesses or not (fixed) or is it possible to improve (growth)? School success and mindset have been linked. The proposed mechanism behind this link is that students with growth mindset exhibit mastery-oriented behaviors in response to challenges, such as embracing hard work and strategizing how to improve. Mindset is typically studied through large-N survey measures with context-general Likert scale items measuring beliefs about the nature of talent and intelligence. We argue that such context-general survey measures are limited in application, particularly in the context of introductory college STEM courses. We describe recent work to improve a preliminary analysis framework that we have developed for coding mindset in interview data.

A four-week-long immersive summer program for high school students was developed, implemented, and assessed. The program was completely directed by an undergraduate physics major and it included a hands-on and student-led capstone project for the high school students. The goal was to create an adaptive and shareable curriculum in order to influence high school students views of university level research and what it means to be a scientist. The program was assessed through various methods including a survey developed for this program, a scientific attitudes survey, weekly blog posts, and an oral exit interview. The curriculum included visits to local STEM laboratories, an introduction to particle physics and the IceCube collaboration, an introduction to electronics and computer programming, and creating and presenting their capstone project. Assessment results and details concerning the curriculum will be discussed.

Based on the advertisements from the PERJobs blog, we estimate that there have been at least 120 PER postdoc positions in the past five years. Hiring for these positions poses several challenges that are unique from hiring postdocs in other fields: prospective postdocs hail from both traditional physics and PER, PIs may not have been PER postdocs, and these positions sometimes require skills that the PI has never used. We conducted an interview study of current and past PER postdocs and PIs who have hired PER postdocs to learn more about hiring practices. This talk highlights some of the preliminary findings from this study regarding how postdocs find positions, what PIs are looking for in a postdoc, and advice that postdocs have for prospective postdocs.

For the last three years, the School of Physics at Georgia Tech has been preparing new Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) with a mentoring and development program that focuses on pedagogy, physics content, and professional development strategies. Our goal is to produce effective GTAs who have a positive impact on student learning, while honing the skills they need to succeed in their future careers. Approximately 70 graduate students have successfully completed the program. The content of the program is revised yearly, based partly on feedback from the participating GTAs. As part of our ongoing assessment, we want to determine the program's impact on GTAs' teaching effectiveness. To do that we performed a statistical analysis of students' responses to end-of-semester GTA evaluations. Here we present the results of our analysis, in particular the comparison between GTAs who participated in the program and GTAs before the program went into effect.

Collaborative relationships between faculty members and LAs can enhance the effectiveness of the LA model by leveraging the expertise of LAs and placing them in positions where they can co-think and co-design activities and lessons for the STEM classroom. Interviews with LAs and faculty members, in addition to video from weekly preparation sessions, illustrate the different types of partnerships that can evolve between LAs and faculty and help us understand the roles different factors play in these partnerships. We describe three types of partnerships that exist along a continuum: mentor-mentee, faculty driven collaboration, and collaborative. This data highlights the importance of student voice and weekly meetings between LAs and faculty members in an LA Program.

While our community is placing increased emphasis on supporting diverse learners, students with disabilities are rarely in the foreground of these efforts. Students with disabilities now make up more than 10% of students pursuing post-secondary degrees. Our project explores university science courses making use of active learning strategies from the perspective of students with executive function disorders, which is common in several disability diagnoses. While active learning strategies, such as studio physics, have been shown to improve learning and retention for many students, it is unknown what strategies represent support for, or barriers to, particular learners in STEM programs. Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is a framework supporting instructors to design a learning experience that enables all learners to naturally engage with the course, reducing the need for accommodations and supporting learning by all students. In this talk, we explore several studio physics courses through the lens of UDL.

We will discuss implications that researchers choice between three commonly used methods for analyzing concept inventories has on making claims about student learning. These three methods are: normalized learning gains using class averages, normalized learning gains using individual student scores, and Cohens d. Historically physics education research has used the first two whereas other fields primarily use Cohens d. Data for the analyses came from the Learning Assistant Supported Student Outcomes (LASSO) database and included pre and/or post-test scores from more than 16,000 students on physics, chemistry, biology, and math concept inventories from 210 courses at 22 institutions across the country. The three methods were compared in aggregate across concept inventories. We will discuss advantages and disadvantages of the different methods and how the choice of method might lead to different inferences about student learning in a course.

A great deal of time and money is spent on science lab courses, but there is little evidence they are providing good educational value, and there is some indication that they are not. In particular, labs suffer from a lack of consensus on goals and on accepted assessment instruments. In this talk, I will introduce the Physics Lab Inventory for Critical thinking, a new assessment under development and validation. It is aimed to assess students' proficiency with critical thinking as related to making sense of data, variability, and models and to assess the efficacy of lab courses at developing these skills. I will briefly outline the motivation and goals of the assessment, the development and validation efforts thus far, and the next steps in the development process.

After five years of implementation and data collection, authors share their assessment of the effects of two new tutorial-based Advanced Placement physics curriculua on student AP scores and diagnostic test performances. Tutorial instruction has been overlooked as a mode of instruction in high school physics classrooms. While some teachers who teach AP physics courses use University of Washington Physics Education Group's "Tutorials in Introductory Physics" as a supplement to lessons, none have designed an entire curriculum with tutorials as the central classroom activity. These new complete AP courses were developed by Gearen at Punahou School in Honolulu, HI, and based heavily on materials from University of Washington. Currently, two schools are implementing Gearen's curricula for AP Physics 1 and 2 and AP Physics C, Punahou and The Blake School in Minneapolis, MN.

For 10 years I have organized a journal club at Emory University that reads and discusses science education research articles. The club includes members from physics, chemistry, biology, math, computer science, psychology, and the medical school; it includes graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty. In this talk I will discuss how the journal club works, give a sense of the impact of this club on teaching at Emory, and give thoughts about how one might start a similar journal club at other schools.

A two-stage group exam is an exam that students first write individually (solo phase), before getting into groups to write the same or a similar exam immediately afterward (group phase). This type of exam has been shown to promote both learning and positive affective benefits for students. To investigate how group exam design---including both question design and group composition---impacts student outcomes, we aim to construct a predictive model for performance on the group phase based on the performance of the students on the solo phase. We discuss preliminary results and implications for instructional design.

The Physics Education Research Group at Georgia State University has implemented two different reforms in algebra-based and calculus-based introductory physics courses. The integrated lecture and lab SCALE-UP approach was implemented in half of the algebra-based introductory physics classes. The lab portion of all of the calculus-based introductory physics classes has been redesigned to include the use of the University of Washington tutorials and learning assistants. Although these reforms are different they share common features of emphasizing conceptual understanding and applying inquiry-based experiments. This study reveals that even though both reforms are able to improve students conceptual understanding and increase their success rates, changing only the lab portion of the class is not sufficient to affect students attitudes and beliefs about learning physics. We will compare the effect of both course reforms on conceptual learning, withdrawal and success rates, and students attitudes and beliefs.

Students in calculus- and algebra-based introductory physics courses have been shown to perform significantly better on vector addition and subtraction tasks using the ijk representation than identical tasks given in an "arrows-on-a-grid'' representation. Evidence has also been provided that calculus-based students exhibit a knowledge hierarchy, with the ability to correctly solve questions in the ijk format necessary to correctly solving questions in the arrow format. The absence of explicit ijk instruction in a typical algebra-based course may cause difficulties experienced by most physics students with vector addition and subtraction in the arrow representation to be exacerbated in the population that typically takes algebra-based physics. In this study we investigate to what degree an instructional intervention in the ijk format improves algebra-based students' ability to correctly answer questions in the arrow representation over a similar instructional intervention in the arrow format. Results and instructional implications will be discussed.

We report on the initial phases of a study to investigate how and to what extent physics majors at a small private urban university campus develop three particular metacognitive gimmicks, namely: checking units for consistency, discerning whether limiting cases match physical intuition, and computing numerical values for reasonable-ness. Students in a one semester Griffiths electromagnetism course for physics majors are conditioned to respond to explicit prompts that encourage adopting these three methods for checking answers to typical textbook physics problems. We explore the time development of student use of these gimmicks in a given course and in a subsequent course. While the term gimmick carries with it some pejorative baggage, we feel it describes the essential nature of the pedagogical idea adequately in that it gets attention, is easy for the students to remember, and represents, albeit perhaps in a surface way, some key ideas about which professional physicists care.

This study evaluates and analyzes understanding and application that undergraduate students have regarding the conception of system. The participants were majors in physics education in Seoul National University, Korea. The research was composed of the survey and interview. Surveys consisted of open response questions that concerned the concept of system and problems in terms of conservation laws. And the interview items were a definition of system and importance of system in physics learning, and what is the function of system in problem solving. Results show that the concepts of system was explained by using one or two keywords; and their explanations were not same with previous research. Participants had difficulties with considering the concept of system and applying the conservation law in the process of problem solving. We discuss the conditions of system-based understanding and hierarchy of conditions.

Understanding the relationships between balancing, mass distribution and the center of mass is challenging for students. In particular there is a widespread tendency to attribute a balanced state to equal amounts of mass to both sides of the fulcrum if the mass distribution is continuous. (1) A number of explanations have been proposed, including a recent suggestion that perceptual difficulties in locating the center of mass are, at least in part, to blame. (2) Recent experiments suggest that it is unlikely that perceptual difficulties play a significant role.

Gender differences on the Conceptual Survey in Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM) have been extensively studied. Ten semesters (N=1621) of CSEM data is presented showing male students outperform female students on the CSEM post-test by 5% (p<.001). Male students also outperform female students on qualitative in-semester test questions by 3% (p=.004), but no significant difference between male and female students was found on quantitative test questions. Male students enter the class with superior prior preparation in the subject and score 4% higher on the CSEM pre-test (p<.001). If the sample is restricted to students with little prior knowledge who answer no more than eight of the 32 questions correctly (N=822), male and female differences on the CSEM and qualitative test questions cease to be significant. This suggests no intrinsic gender bias exists in the CSEM itself and that gender differences are the result of prior preparation measured by CSEM pre-test score.

We are continuing an investigation of mathematical difficulties that pose obstacles for students in introductory university physics courses. We have documented that a substantial proportion of students consistently make errors on high-school-level trigonometry and algebra problems; error rates vary from 10-30% in second-semester calculus-based courses to 70% and higher in first-semester algebra-based courses. Based on analysis of students' responses to written diagnostics and on one-on-one problem-solving interviews, we observe that these student difficulties have three primary components: (1) simple carelessness; (2) inadequate skill levels; (3) difficulties with mathematical concepts. We are exploring the relative magnitude of these components along with the nature and strength of their interaction, in an effort to find effective methods for improving students' performance.

Mathematical difficulties of introductory physics students are well documented, but not all such difficulties have yet been carefully examined. One of the most frequently encountered types of mathematical problem to arise in introductory physics is the solution of systems of equations involving just two or three variables. For example, when balancing force vectors in a plane, students are often confronted with two equations and two unknowns, and are asked to find the values of the variables. As part of a larger study, we have developed a diagnostic that includes multiple questions about solving such small systems of equations. This diagnostic was given to over 600 students in first- and second-semester physics courses, and preliminary results show that many students struggle to solve these problems. We will present our methods and findings, including possible insights into how students approach the problem of solving systems of equations.

The Emory-Tibet Science Initiative (ETSI) is designed to introduce modern science to Tibetan Buddhist monks studying in monastic institutions in India. Participating monks are exposed to concepts of Philosophy of Science, Biology, Neuroscience, and Mathematics & Physics every summer over the course of six years. First-year students learn basic mathematics and an overview of physics concepts such as kinematics, Newtons laws, and astronomy. Second-year students learn mechanics, third-year students learn thermodynamics, and fourth-year students learn electricity and magnetism. The physics portion of the program is currently in its fourth year of planning. Here, instructors travel to one of the three different participating monasteries in India for two-three weeks in summer. This program is sponsored by Emory University. https://tibet.emory.edu/emory-tibet-science-initiative/
