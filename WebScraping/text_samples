Physical World Lab is a standalone conceptual physics laboratory course at KSU taken by non-STEM majors who need a laboratory credit. Recently the course was revised with the help of a grant of tablet PCs, and the students have been surveyed over the course of two semesters to determine their reactions to the new technology and procedures. Given that this course is traditionally majority-female, we decided to look at gender differences in their responses, and this poster will present the more interesting results.

We measured pre-post learning gains in a large large-enrollment (N=425) Calculus-based Physics II course, randomly assigning half the class to the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment (BEMA)[1] instrument (for which we have seven earlier semesters of data), and half taking the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism[2]. We present our results comparing student outcomes (pre, post, and gains), including common questions on the two instruments. We find similar distributions and statistically indistinguishable gains, with lower absolute BEMA scores. We also investigate gender differences, and present correlations of both pre- and post- conceptual scores with traditional measures of student learning, including exam scores and course grades, as well as with results from the Lawson test of scientific reasoning[3], and the Colorado Learning Attittudes about Science Survey[4] (pre- and post)

Force Concept Inventory (FCI) tool has been used to investigate students' conceptions on force, however, we have found that some problems do not give enough information to figure out an exact meaning. We have tried to modify or insert figures into the original FCI. Improved FCI has diagnosed effectively students' conception.

Traditionally in introductory physics laboratories, students' role is limited to following the directions provided in step-by-step handouts.Their activities are very far from the work of physicists who have to make innumerable decisions during their investigations such as when designing experimental procedures, making assumptions, minimizing uncertainty, interpreting the data, hypothesizing explanations, testing their hypothesis and solving experimental problems. We believe that if students have the opportunity to experience laboratories closer to the practice of real science--by having to design their own experiments--their learning opportunities would be greatly enriched. We analyzed the videos of groups of students designing their own investigations when solving a problem in a new area of physics without any hints or the help of instructors, to explore students' approaches, interactions and reasoning.

The conceptual problem content of the electricity and magnetism chapters of seven physics textbooks was investigated. The textbooks presented a total of 1600 conceptual electricity and magnetism problems. The solution to each problem was decomposed into its fundamental reasoning steps. These fundamental steps are, then, used to quantify the distribution of conceptual content among the set of topics common to the texts. The variation of the distribution of conceptual coverage within each text is studied. The variation between the major groupings of the textbooks (conceptual, algebra-based, and calculus-based) is also studied. A measure of the conceptual complexity of the problems in each text is presented. A measure of the degree each problem is conceptual is also presented.

When students enter the classroom for the first time, they have certain expectations regarding what and how they are going to learn. In pedagogically reformed classrooms, these expectations are often at odds with the actual class structure, and much of the beginning of the term is spent negotiating a new social contract. Therefore, both teachers and students could benefit from better understanding precisely what students expect at the beginning of a class and how those expectations evolve. This study of students enrolled in an introductory physics SCALE-UP class at N.C. State draws on expectancy violation literature in communication and education to provide a comparison of student expectations and classroom reality. While results are preliminary, this study should encourage larger, broader studies to better understand what students expect and how reformed pedagogy classes may violate those expectations.

Our previous research[1] showed that despite the use of interactive engagement techniques, the gap in performance between males and females on a conceptual learning survey persisted from pre- to post-test at our institution (differences are about 10 percentage points). Such findings were counter to previously published work.[2] A follow-up study[3] suggested the gender gap may be more a result of differences in previous physics knowledge than gender. Our current research continues to analyze the factors that may influence the observed gender gap in our courses. We perform a multiple regression analysis and find that the average gender difference, after controlling for previous physics knowledge, math skill, and attitudes and beliefs, is about 4 percentage points. These findings indicate that the gender gap exists in interactive physics classes at our institution, but is due in large part to differences in previous physics knowledge, math skills, and attitudes and beliefs.

Problem solving is one of the primary teaching goals, teaching tools, and evaluation techniques of physics courses. Unfortunately, there is no standard way to evaluate problem solving that is valid, reliable, and easy to use. Such an assessment instrument is necessary if different curricular materials or pedagogies are to be compared. This tool might also be useful to diagnose student difficulty and direct instruction. The main challenges with constructing such an instrument include defining relevant categories and obtaining evidence for validity and reliability. We will report progress on instrument development, including results from our ongoing pilot study.

Students in our introductory physics courses appear to be learning classical physics in a way that promotes a local-realist perspective -- one where physical quantities such as position and momentum have well-defined values at all times. Such a perspective can be problematic for students as they learn quantum physics: a shift away from the realist position is required when learning to interpret what it means to measure a quantum observable. We document this shift through pre/post-instruction evaluations of student beliefs using the CLASS survey. We further examine responses to coupled exam questions designed to characterize several aspects of "quantum sophistication" in students: their ontological commitments in the context of both classical and quantum uncertainty; their epistemological commitments through the degree of sense-making used in support of their positions; and their understanding of completeness in quantum theory.

One important aspect of physics instruction is helping students develop better problem-solving expertise. Besides enhancing the content knowledge, problems help students develop different cognitive abilities and skills. This poster focuses on ill-structured problems (or multiple-possibility problems). These cognitively rich problems are different from traditional "end of chapter" well-structured problems. They do not have one right answer and thus the student has to examine different possibilities, assumptions and evaluate the outcomes. The poster describes the structure of such problems, provides examples of multiple possibility physics problems, and presents a rubric for scaffolding and assessing student work.

The University of Maryland is investigating the specific nature of TAs' experience with reform instruction. The study uses reflective interviews and video of classroom interactions to investigate how TAs frame their role in tutorials, how they listen to students, what questions they ask, and what their goals seem to be in particular interactions in the classroom. We will discuss some of our preliminary findings about how the TAs that we observe view the nature of physics, their interpretations of instructional advice, and the utility of case studies to better understand how tutorial TAs behave in the classroom, as well as how we can better characterize productive TA actions.

At the start of the 2007 fall semester, two introductory physics classes (n = 114) at the University of Northern Colorado took the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) and the Lawson Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning Ability. Both groups also took the FCI again at the end of the semester. Information about each student's gender and high school preparation in mathematics and physics was also collected. Several previous investigations of the improvement in FCI scores (and its correlations) have focused only on the total score. We present an analysis of the students' improvement on each question on the FCI and how it correlates with other factors.

A major goal of introductory physics education is improving students' ability to apply their scientific knowledge to situations they encounter outside their physics class. However, prior research shows a decline in students' belief in the real-world relevance of physics after introductory physics instruction, which may prevent them from ever attempting to utilize their knowledge. To address this disconnect, UBC's introductory physics course for non-majors was completely revamped in fall 2007. The course curriculum was reworked to present physics in terms of real-world issues of energy and climate change and applications of physics were emphasized through classroom examples and context-rich tutorial problems. This presentation focuses on measuring the impact of these changes on student attitudes and problem solving skills. A survey is presented which is being developed into a reliable measure of students? ability to apply physics knowledge outside the classroom. Results and initial interpretations of our measurements will be presented.

A central aim of physics education research has been to characterize the ideas that students have about physical phenomena prior to and often continuing through instruction. The existence of common patterns in students' responses to physics questions makes it possible to categorize student ideas in ways that are practical for both research and instructional design. However, the search for and use of broad categorizations contributes to the wide-spread tendency to attribute singular conceptions to students thinking about specific topics. We present examples in which the patterns of student responses to motion questions suggest a significant amount of variation in the ways students think about these situations, undermining the utility of singular-attribution characterizations in these cases. We discuss theoretical arguments for recasting measures of variability as being central to understanding student thinking, and discuss how variability may be exploited methodologically to bring further insights into student thinking and learning.

Success in physics, or in science, requires an ability to reason logically and consistently using a premise or hypothesis. However, the reasoning skills so necessary for success may not be common among incoming students to universities currently. Identifying factors contributing to the poor performance of students in STEM courses is a necessary step in improving the learning of students in those courses. However, college science and math faculty may be unaware of these developmental milestones and may make the incorrect assumption that all students in their classrooms are equally ready to tackle the cognitive tasks required for reasoning in science and math. Faculty teaching STEM courses at Columbus State University have administered Lawson's Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning (1) to their students. Preliminary results and future directions of the study will be presented.

We have compared performance of students scoring 1 standard deviation below average (D group) with students scoring 1 standard deviation above average (A group) on final exam problems requiring analytic solutions, some also requiring a written plan of attack. By classifying students' solutions on the basis of the extent to which they identified the relevant physical principles in the problem, we found that typically only 34% of the D group met this criterion vs. 80% of the A group. We also found that students' written plans of attack closely correlated with their analytic solutions. We suggest that our typical "one topic per week" organization of the course does not prepare students to identify the physical principles that apply to a problem that might cover any of a broad range of topics. We discuss implications of these findings for course organization and pedagogy.

We are engaged in a project to systematize the process of quantitatively measuring student answers. We show that the type of question influences the methods used to measure the difference between two students' answers. Student responses are then grouped based on similarity. However, some students are halfway between two well-populated groups. We look at ways of handling these students in our classification system and discuss how that affects the final classification of the whole class.

We are investigating how students tackle problems in geometrical optics involving ray constructions, after being intrigued by certain strange solution attempts. We find that students use various reasoning modes and knowledge elements in conjunction. Their thinking may usefully be described as an interplay of principle-based, procedure-based, case-based and experiential-intuitive reasoning. This draws on a knowledge mixture of basic principles, procedures, specific cases and recalled result features. Even though we usually present solutions and teach problem-solving as a systematic application of principles, real cognition is more complex. Associative thinking in terms of prior case results seems to be a strong natural tendency of both novices and experts. Novices are not easily able to discriminate the specific from the general. Our research findings will be illustrated by examples of student thinking on problems involving reflection, refraction and images. The instructional implications of the research will be discussed.

Pre-/post-testing with conceptual surveys is frequently used to assess student learning gains. Though it is recognized that timing and incentives can impact test results, these variables frequently are not controlled across different studies. Pretests are administered either at or near the beginning of a course, while post-tests are given at or near the end of a course. There also is no accepted norm for offering incentives. To study the impact of such variations, we analyzed four years of data that were collected at The Ohio State University from over 2100 students, who were pre-/post-tested with the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism. Results will be presented indicating that the time frames for giving this test had marked effects on results, and incentive-granting had a significant influence. This study suggests that testing conditions should be carefully controlled and documented.

At Western Washington University, efforts are under way to implement research-based laboratory curriculum in the introductory calculus-based physics course. When possible, existing, well-tested curricula such as Real Time Physics** and Tutorials in Introductory Physics*** are being adapted. Assessment of student learning is integral to the project. This poster will provide a brief overview of the labs and will present assessment results from CSEM****. A closer look at the laboratory on the superposition of electric fields will then be taken. Documented student difficulties with superposition have been used to inform the design of instruction. Students are guided through a cycle of predict-observe-explain, using the simulation program EMField6.

We have reported previously that upper-level thermodynamics students demonstrate an inability to correctly equate the mixed second-order partial derivatives of the state function of volume (nonzero quantities in general), arguing instead that these derivatives must identically equal zero.[1] Here we document the presence of this difficulty among students enrolled in a multivariable calculus course. Data were gathered via diagnostic questions structurally identical to those administered in the thermodynamics course, yet devoid of physical context. We additionally present a guided-inquiry tutorial sequence that was specifically developed to address this and related student difficulties with partial derivatives encountered in our research. The sequence uses a graphical interpretation of partial derivatives in the context of an ideal gas P-V-T surface to bridge the abstract mathematical concepts with concrete physical properties. Preliminary results indicate that the sequence effectively addresses the above difficulty, and also positively impacts student performance on related topics.

Previous work on students' understanding of graphical interpretation of slope, derivative, and area under curves in various physics contexts has shown substantial difficulties, most notably in kinematics.[1] Concurrently, several reports point toward students' lack of algebraic acumen as a likely cause for their low achievement in a physics classroom.[2] In order to see if some of the documented issues arise from being asked mathematical questions about single- and multivariable calculus concepts in a physics course, we administered a brief survey on these basic concepts to students near the end of multivariable calculus. Some of the questions are based on our earlier work in thermal physics that are essentially stripped of their physics content. Initial findings show that even after three semesters of university-level calculus students struggle with basic concepts of integration and derivative. Individual survey items and summative scores will be presented.

Research has shown that students' beliefs about how they learn can affect they way in which they learn. Their beliefs can vary greatly and often differ from the beliefs instructors hold about learning and about the purposes of assigned tasks. Given that problem solving is an integral part of students' experience in introductory physics courses, we investigated the relationship between students' epistemologies (their personal philosophies about learning) and their approaches to physics problem solving. Using a case-study design, we conducted think-aloud interviews with students while they solve a series of mechanics problem. Interview data was analyzed using constant comparative method and students' problem solving was analyzed using a rubric developed at our institution. This study was conducted in the context of a large-scale implementation of Matter & Interactions, an innovative introductory curriculum emphasizing reasoning from fundamental physics principles and the microscopic structure of matter.

Modeling-based introductory physics courses are the foundation for undergraduate student community reform at Florida International University (FIU). During these courses, students learn cooperatively in groups and build their scientific reasoning skills as they actively engage content and build their physics understanding. Upon completing these courses, physics majors continue learning cooperatively in a rich learning, teaching, and research community supported by CHEPREO. CHEPREO, the Center for High-Energy Physics Research and Education Outreach, is located at FIU, a MSI serving more than 38,000 students in Miami, FL. The presentation will include learning and epistemological gains as well as performance in upper-division physics courses for majors, with comparisons between students in modeling courses and traditional lecture classes. We find that modeling students outperform traditional students as indicated by these measures, and report the first significant gain in favorable attitudes toward science and science learning.

As part of ongoing research into upper-level undergraduate student understanding of thermodynamics at the University of Maine, we report on students' understanding of thermodynamic work, internal energy and the associated mathematics. New interview data of physics majors, as well as written data obtained in a Calculus III class, support our previous findings [1] and provide for a more in-depth look into factors impacting student difficulties with thermodynamic quantities. Analysis of written and interview data has revealed student conceptions about integration that might otherwise be interpreted as conceptual difficulties with the physics. The data suggest that students' application of the state function concept to thermodynamic work may be due in part to incorrect conceptions regarding integration. The data also suggest that students lack the correct mathematical foundation of the state function concept, which may be a factor in its indiscriminate application.

In our reformed introductory Physics course at UC Davis, our students do the majority of their learning in the 5-hour per week discussion/lab, rather than in the single 80-minute lecture. The lecture supplements the discussion/lab, rather than the other way around as in a traditional course. This arrangement puts a tremendous amount of responsibility on the discussion/lab instructors, most of whom are graduate student TAs. These TAs are expected to engage in dialogue with their students, use Socratic questioning techniques in place of explaining, and hold whole class discussions in which the bigger conceptual picture is addressed. In spite of extensive TA training that stresses these reformed teaching techniques, in practice many TAs rely on the traditional teaching methods they are more familiar with. We present results of a 150-hour observational study of TA teaching behaviors, and how they affect student performance controlling for GPA and other demographic factors.

Problems are an important teaching tool in introductory physics courses. Their structure influences how students approach both the subject matter and the problem-solving process. To understand how instructors design and choose problems, the Physics Education Research Group at the University of Minnesota has developed an interview tool to investigate instructors' views about the learning and teaching of problem solving. In one part of the interview, instructors were asked to evaluate a set of five problem formulations that might be assigned for students to solve. We found that although instructors frequently value many of the features of problems that enhance learning, their test problems rarely contain these features. In this presentation we will briefly describe the interview tool and discuss the results of data from 30 college instructors.

Student achievement in the introductory calculus-based physics course is analyzed as a function of course format and course-section instructor behavior. I investigate performance on the Force Concept Inventory by students in two 150-student lecture sections of the same course taught by the same faculty member, one taught in a traditional manner, the other taught with reduced lecture and with the discussion and lab sections combined into a 4.5 hr/wk discussion lab. The activities in the discussion/lab are based on the implications of a constructivist learning theory. Students in the modified course are further divided into those who have teaching assistants who embrace the modified course philosophy and those who do not. I find no significant difference based on the course format, but students experiencing instructional environments with "constructivist" TAs outperform students with traditional TAs. Performance differences on common final-exam questions will also be reported.

Although students' general abilities of learning have attracted much attention recently, the relationship between scientific reasoning ability and academic performance remains essentially unexplored. We investigated this relationship for students at multiple grades levels including middle school, high school, and college. Lawson's Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning was used to measure students' scientific reasoning ability and student performance data was gathered in the form of exam scores from math and/or science classes. Gender and ethnicity data was gathered when possible. This poster presents a summary of our findings in addition to next steps for this important area of research.

A cohort of 48 entering freshmen is closely followed beginning F07 as they take specially created lab/discussion sections of chemistry using active learning activities, special calculus lecture sections using a large-group questioning approach, and the previously reformed physics course. Chemistry and calculus sections are taught by specially trained senior Tas. Evaluation includes both quantitative and qualitative methods. Data include performance in the target courses as well as in subsequent courses for both the cohort and the much larger group of non-cohort students, at both the course grade level and at the individual exam-problem level. Admissions data and various GPAs are used to control for individual student variation in order to isolate the effect of simultaneously taking the modified courses. Pre-post surveys and interviews are used to uncover changes in attitudes toward STEM courses, approaches to studying and learning, and epistemological factors. Analysis of the first year's data will be presented.

We describe our effort to design and implement an instrument to systematically test student conceptual understanding of simple relationships among force, velocity, and acceleration. While there have been a significant number of studies on this topic, here we focus on determining whether there is a hierarchy of understanding among these variables. For example, can students understand that net force and velocity need not be in the same direction, without first understanding that acceleration and velocity need not be in the same direction? We explore different variations of question formats and find a format that is reasonably valid and reliable. Preliminary results indicate that there may be some hierarchies in student understanding of moderate to weak strength. For example, we find evidence that understanding the relation between acceleration and velocity may necessarily precede understanding the relation between force and velocity. We describe experiments in progress designed to further test these results.

The assessment of whether students are meeting the general education objectives of an institution of higher education is becoming more common. The Middle States Accreditation process in the United States requires colleges and universities in the region to gather and analyze data showing whether courses, which are part of a general education requirement, are meeting the general education goals and objectives of the college or university. This talk will discuss the first year of a five-year plan to assess how well an introductory algebra/trig physics course meets some of the core curriculum objectives of Misericordia University. A rubric was designed and trialed to score the goal: Students will be able to use mathematics as a means of communicating ideas and relationships. The talk will discuss the design and modification of the rubric, and the results of the first year assessment of this goal.

The education and cognitive science literature contains a wide range of ideas about problem solving in math and science and the teaching of scientific problem solving. Some claim the evidence shows that skills and processes used while solving a problem are all domain specific while others say there are general skills and processes that are used and can be taught across disciplines. A close look at the existing research shows that only a very small range of problems and people have been studied resulting in limited data from which to draw understanding. We have developed and validated a problem-solving evaluation tool that measures competence in 44 specific cognitive processes that people use when solving a wide range of in-depth problems including classical mechanics and quantum mechanics problems. Understanding the specific processes that impact how a person solves a problem explains the previous contradictions in the literature, identifies which components are domain specific and those that transfer across domains, and provides insight for improved methods for teaching.

Students' general ability in reasoning such as scientific reasoning, logical reasoning, and critical thinking has been intensely studied for decades by psychologists, cognitive scientists and education researchers. A number of standardized instruments have also been developed and adopted by researchers and educators.

Based on the definition, we will compare several existing instruments on how specific skills are measured and discuss examples of student performances on these skill dimensions.

We present the results of learning in an introductory physics laboratory course for student physics teachesr at UPEL-IPC, in Venezuela. The study involves two semesters (2006-II/2007-II). The Laboratory Work (LW) focuses on problem-solving situations that can be of three types (exploration, relational, application). The solution of one LW involves the performance five sets of actions (phases) interrelation [1] that we derived from epistemological analysis of the scientific activity. For each phase, we established criteria achievements that are known by students and are used for evaluation and self-evaluation. Students discussed, planned, and executed each phase, making decisions in groups. This process is mediated by the teacher, with attention to a learning model that describes the conceptual development in the action [2].

Interactive teaching methods are student-centered in their pedagogy, yet we know little about what students actually think about these methods.

This additional insight from students about interactive methods can benefit both new and experienced instructors.

Experienced tutorial instructors and developers are well aware that successful implementation includes establishing norms for learning in the tutorial classroom. The teaching assistants (TAs) who lead each tutorial section are important arbiters of these norms. TAs who value tutorials are more likely to convey their respect for the material and the tutorial process to the students, as well as learning more themselves. Professional development programs for TAs typically include activities to help TAs appreciate the power of tutorial instruction. Our research suggests that specific professional development activities are not likely to be effective. Instead, it appears that what we call the "tutorial infrastructure" -- including classroom, departmental, and institutional levels of implementation -- has the potential to strongly affect the value that TAs attach to tutorials, and probably outweighs the influence of any particular activity that we might prepare for them.

In the real world we often face situations when we need to solve problems in the area outside of our direct expertise. How do we solve these problems? To investigate the answer to this question, we studied how students approach a situation when they need to design an experiment to determine the value of a physical quantity that they have not seen before without any help from the instructor. We conducted a quantitative study videotaping eight groups of students of different levels of general expertise in physics working on such a problem. We found that different groups framed the task differently, adopting and activating different goals and sets of cognitive resources, therefore they practiced different epistemic games. We observed that students refined and modified their goals as they planned and conducted their experiments. Although students' approaches varied greatly, all students played more adequate epistemic games as their investigation progressed.

A model-based framework for teaching and learning physics suggests that pedagogical activities should highlight the modelling nature of physics and allow students opportunities to construct their own mental models and explore the relationships between them. The current study explores the effectiveness of the use of programming activities that require students to write and use their own programs in the formation of conceptual models. The sample cohort is from the introductory mainstream physics course at the University of Cape Town, which is based on the Matter and Interactions curriculum and introduces computation as a modelling tool using VPython. The computational tasks are designed as interactive worksheets to allow students to critically study the presented physical system in various representations. The results of this study will be used to inform the structure of further interactive programming activities designed to facilitate students' construction of appropriate mental models. Implications for the successful inclusion of computational physics in introductory physics curricula will be discussed.

Case-based reasoning (CBR) is the process of solving a real-world problem based on precedent examples and problems. Case-reuse promotes CBR by employing problem pairs that share similarities in deep structure. We conducted focus group learning interviews with 10 students in an algebra-based class a total of eight times during the semester. During each session participants were paired together each working on a different problem. The problems shared deep structure similarities but had surface differences. After students solved these problems, they were asked to discuss their solutions with their partner briefly and discuss the similarities and differences between each of the problems. Finally, students were asked to work with their partner to create their own problem using elements they selected from both original problems. We will discuss how the interview protocol evolved over the semester and the extent to which these interviews facilitated case reuse strategies during problem solving.

We explore strategies that facilitate the productive use of previous examples in problem solving. A cohort of 10 students participated in eight meetings, which lasted one hour each and focused on facilitating case reuse strategies in problem solving. Data were collected from five multiple-choice examinations taken during the semester. While most of the exams focused on traditional problem solving, the last three questions on each examination were nontraditional tasks: jeopardy, text editing and problem posing. Individual scores for each examination question were analyzed. Our results show a statistically significant difference on some, but not all of the nontraditional questions between our cohort group and the rest of the class. The results also show that there was no statistically significant difference between the cohort group and the rest of the class on traditional questions. We will discuss the implications of our results and ongoing plans in this project.

As part of a large study of how student ideas change in response to instruction, we collect student test data many times throughout a course, allowing for the measurement of the changes of student knowledge with a time resolution on the order of a few days. In this talk, we report on Newton's third law conceptual data taken in a calculus-based introductory mechanics class populated primarily by first- and second-year engineering majors. Unsurprisingly for a traditional introductory course, there is little change on many conceptual questions. However, the data suggest that some student ideas peak and decay rapidly during a quarter, a pattern consistent with memory research yet unmeasurable by pre-/post-testing. Furthermore, there appears to be a difference in the amount of change between low performing and high performing students.

In a series of tests administered to introductory physics students, we examine how students answer questions about the direction of the magnetic force on a charged particle. Data have been taken using two representations of the magnetic field (i.e. field lines and magnetic poles) over a period of 17 weeks. Unique patterns are observed for different answer choices within the representations. For example, within the field line representation, the proportion of answers that indicate a sign error along the solution path increases only after instruction, unlike the proportion of correct answers, which increases during instruction. Evidence from interviews suggests that these sign errors are not due to an incorrectly executed right-hand rule, while written tests, designed to probe the nature of this difficulty, uncover several explanations such as lack of knowledge of the direction of the field between magnetic poles and belief that the cross product is commutative.

This talk, which is a follow-up to "Development of an Assessment of Textbook Problem Solving Ability Part I: Overview and Rationale" will focus on the domain and types of problems we plan to assess with our instrument. Specifically, we are considering how to structure, organize, and present students with multiple-choice items that will reasonably characterize their problem-solving abilities in the realms of dynamics, energy, and momentum. We have chosen to focus on these three basic domains because of their central importance to a wide audience of introductory physics instructors and because they will, potentially, help us avoid the complications of layering multiple levels of conceptual understanding in a small number of items.

Explicit classroom instruction on the control of variables, if delivered at all, usually focuses on the design and interpretation of experiments in order to decide whether or not a variable affects the behavior of a system. Numerous studies have examined the facility of precollege students with this type of reasoning. Over the past five years, efforts at Western Washington University and the University of Washington have been under way to extend this research to additional populations and to more sophisticated reasoning contexts. In particular, we have examined student ability to apply the reasoning needed to identify whether or not a given single variable can be used to predict the behavior of a system. The findings indicate that students of varying age and science background, including pre-college teachers, undergraduates enrolled in physics courses for nonscience majors, and students in the introductory calculus-based physics course, all experience difficulty with this type of control of variables reasoning. Results from written questions and interviews will be used to illustrate specific difficulties.

Students' difficulties with conceptual questions about force, velocity, and acceleration have been well documented. However, there has been no single systematic study of student understanding of all paired relations among the concepts of force, velocity, and acceleration. We report on results from a test designed to indicate any hierarchical structure in student conceptual understanding of the relations between force, velocity, and acceleration. For example, we find evidence suggesting that correctly understanding the concept that acceleration and velocity are not directionally related, i.e. an object accelerating to the left does not have to be moving to the left, is necessary but not sufficient for understanding that net force and velocity are not directionally related. These results may indicate a natural and/or necessary evolution of student understanding of the relations among force, velocity and acceleration.

A key question in physics education is the effectiveness of the teaching methods. A relatively new method at the University of Central Florida (UCF) is that of Real Time Physics (RTP). It is a three-part student interactive format that has met with success at other universities. At the completion of the spring 2008 semester, UCF had two semesters using RTP in some classes while keeping a Traditional Format (TF) in others. Using a pre- and post-semester test, as well as student interviews, the preliminary data indicates a successful project at UCF.

At Oregon State University, we are undergoing curriculum reform in our large-enrollment introductory calculus-based physics sequence. As part of this reform, we are integrating course goals and materials borrowed from the ISLE (Investigative Science Learning Environment) curriculum at Rutgers and California State University, Chico. To successfully implement the scientific process approach in ISLE, it is important to appropriately discourse with students. As part of the assessment of our course reform, we are therefore studying the development of teacher/student dialogue in the lecture portion of the course in order to optimize this dialogue and prepare future teachers to lead these courses. We have observed and recorded the statements and actions in the teacher/student interactions each class period. We developed a coding rubric to analyze the types of discourse used by a teacher applying the ISLE method for the first time. The development of teacher/student discourse during the term will be presented.

Using Lawson's test and newly developed questions, we collected data with students from the 3rd grade to college in both China and the United States. In this talk, we will compare the results of the Lawson test and the new questions to produce a scalable metric among these questions. We will also discuss the developmental scale and culturally based differences of each skilled dimensions measured in the assessment of scientific reasoning. The results and analysis will provide a baseline for using these instruments in research and for further development of questions and methods for assessment of scientific reasoning.

Increasingly, modern physics and introductory quantum mechanics are included in first-year university physics courses.The Physics Education Group at the University of Washington is examining student understanding of some basic concepts that underpin these advanced topics and has begun to develop tutorials to supplement standardinstruction.(1)We present results from pre-tests and post-tests thatillustrate some common difficulties and indicate how we are trying to provide students with the requisite background for developing an understanding of these sophisticated concepts.

The instructional approach in the introductory physics class at Chicago State University (CSU) encourages the use of guided inquiry. Anecdotal evidence from these classes suggests that our students value this method of instruction in helping them understand the material. Recently, we developed a survey to quantify these observations. Our results indicate that the acceptance of this type of instruction is a resource that our population of students possess. Recently, we have revised the survey, based on interview responses, and we are now beginning to expand this study to other introductory physics classes at CSU and other universities. This work will help us answer a number of questions regarding the attitudes toward the use of questions in the classroom. Identifying and understanding these resources are important because they help foster effective collaboration.

When students learn a new physics principle, that principle can become bound up with salient features of the example(s) in which the principle was instantiated. Rather than suggest this specificity effect is a difficulty that needs to be overcome, we suggest that it is an efficient way to solve certain types of physics problems. Even expert problem-solvers use problem surface features to cue relevant principled knowledge. The specificity effect becomes a difficulty when students are unable or unwilling to use the resources they have to consciously evaluate and self-assess their work in progress, in other words, to innovate. In this talk we will try to disentangle the ideas of innovation and efficiency in learning physics and discuss the implications of the specificity effect for what our physics students learn and how they learn it.

This talk (part I of II) will summarize our recent instructional changes to Physics 100, a half-semester course designed to prepare entering engineering freshmen for introductory university physics. The course targets a subpopulation of students with low probabilities for success in introductory physics, as determined by demographic factors and performance on a diagnostic task. One major change has been the introduction of web-based animated multimedia presentations ("PreLectures") for the initial presentation of the material. We have also reduced the small group discussion sessions from two hours to one hour to allow for the addition of a clicker-based interactive lecture dealing with conceptual difficulties found in post-PreLecture online assessments.

A common belief about education in science is that learning content knowledge in science and mathematics will improve students' overall scientific ability such as reasoning. However, our recent study shows that learning scientific content in the traditional education style doesn't improve students' scientific reasoning. To obtain further evidence on people's perceptions and views on science learning, we developed a survey instrument to study this issue. Our survey results show that the majority of people believe that learning science knowledge in schools will play an important role in developing students' reasoning ability. Comparisons of results from people with different backgrounds have shown interesting differences that are consistent with our previous research.

RealTime Physics (RTP), an activity-based curriculum developed by Sokoloff, Thornton and Laws, has been proven very effective for knowledge gain in Introductory Physics with calculus in various institutions. The curriculum was recently adopted at the University of Central Florida, a large metropolitan university in Orlando.

Development of students' "problem solving ability" is commonly cited as one of the primary goals in introductory physics courses. However, especially if physics education researchers are consulted, there is no broadly agreed upon definition of what is meant by problem solving. Most physicists ultimately want students to be able to successfully apply a logically yet flexible approach to solving real-world problems significantly different from any they have seen before. Still, many introductory instructors are first and foremost concerned with how successfully and thoughtfully students solve standard textbook-style problems. In this talk we will give an overview of a multiple-choice instrument we are developing to assess students' ability to solve standard textbook-style problems. In addition, we will make clear our goals and rationale for development of this tool and present opportunities for collaboration and/or beta testing of the instrument.

We examine students' ability to distinguish between the "y" value of a point on a line and the slope of a point on a line. We test three groups of calculus-based introductory physics students on three kinds of graphs: generic y vs. x graphs, position vs. time graphs, and electric potential vs. position graphs. Questions are posed about slope, speed, and electric field respectively for each group. The graphs and questions in all three groups are isomorphic. Students perform almost perfectly when asked to compare "slopes" on a generic graph, yet their performance decreases significantly when asked to compare speeds or electric fields, where they tend to choose the "y" value (height of point on line). Students readily state that "speed is slope" when prompted, yet they do not appear to be spontaneously applying this simple extra step. This exemplifies students' problem of when to apply knowledge.

Research on students' scientific reasoning has attracted much attention in PER. In a large-scale quantitative study, we used the Lawson's classroom test of scientific reasoning to collect data in China and the United States with students from 3rd grade to college. In-depth analysis allowed us to explore the possible gender differences in the Lawson test results and how such differences evolve with age. We will compare results of students with different background from both countries.

Instructors often wonder whether there is a diagnostic test or some other information that can be used to determine a student's readiness for introductory college physics. To investigate this, we examine the correlation of pre test scores from both the Force Concept Inventory and a Mathematics Skills Test with grades in introductory physics courses. These courses are taught at the University of Minnesota where part of the pedagogy is based on Cooperative Group Problem Solving. Data is analyzed separately for males and females to test for gender differences in the predictive power of these diagnostic exams.

Problem solving is a complex skill that is important for learning physics. Unfortunately, there is no standard way to evaluate problem solving. An assessment tool commonly used for complex processes such as problem solving is a rubric, which divides a skill into multiple categories and defines criteria met to attain a score in each. Such rubrics are often difficult and time-consuming to use. We will report progress on the development of a physics problem-solving rubric that is simple, fast, and requires minimal training yet remains reasonably valid and reliable.

The Lawson Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning (LCTSR) is becoming more widely used in PER. Unfortunately, the validity of the test is not well established and it is not known how student background impacts LCTSR scores. We present results of a correlation study that investigates the relationship between student LCTSR scores and multiple factors including school type (public vs. private), school performance index rating, prior math and science courses taken by the student, gender, and state-mandated student test scores. The results provide a general understanding of how to interpret assessment results on scientific reasoning.

It is well known that students have difficulty with measurement and uncertainty in introductory physics laboratories. As part of a broader program, studies are being carried out at the University of Cape Town to determine what factors might influence students' framing of measurement activities with a view to harnessing productive measurement resources that may be identified. The present work looks into whether audience plays a role in the way information is selected and conveyed when reporting measurement. An instrument comprising a set of written questions based on a scientific measurement scenario was administered to a group of physics freshmen both before and after a semester of laboratory instruction. The instrument and the analysis framework will be discussed with a focus on the results of three of the questions in which students were asked how they would report to the following audiences, namely, an instructor, a friend and a formal report.

"Science thrills us, when we are interested in the lives of famous scientists, we start to follow the history of their discoveries." (J.C. Maxwell ) Biographical material has to be based on concrete facts, and should constitute a part of the logical presentation of the information offered by the teacher. The deep understanding of the most important fundamental ideas, laws, and theories in the secondary school course of physics can often be achieved only by describing the scientist's road to discovery. For example, understanding the essence and significance of Newtonian mechanics can be achieved only by familiarizing the students with the history of overcoming Aristotelian ideas in physics. In this case "controversy over generations" between Aristotle and Galileo is the basic ground in studying of Newton's first law and Galileo's principle of relativity. In general, biographical material stimulates mastering the difficulties of the educational material by the students (especially by those for whom physics is their weak point). In this case, the explanation of new material should start from an illustrative example, showing the scientist's inventiveness, his diligence, and persistence in achieving the goal, etc. It is important to familiarize the students (especially those who like physics) with the style of the scientist's thinking. In their study of fundamental experimental discoveries and theories, the students' attention should be concentrated on the search for the right solution, on the hopes and doubts that characterize the creative process, on the evaluation of the discovery by the scientist himself--all this knowledge enables the students to develop the qualities of a future researcher.This approach to teaching helps the student to learn the scientific method in physics.

In a summer professional development course on energy in physics, secondary teachers spontaneously considered not only the amount and forms of energy involved in physical processes, but also the energy's usefulness. For example, some teachers discussed situations in which they viewed energy as losing value during a process, even when they explicitly acknowledged that the total amount of energy was constant. Others articulated that the quality, usefulness, or availability of the energy decreased when it changed form (e.g., from kinetic to thermal). These ideas might be resources from which to construct a coherent model for energy usefulness, dissipation, and degradation which can be applied across a wide range of physical scenarios. They might also be the basis for a meaningful connection between energy that is conserved (in a physics context) and energy that is used up (in a sociopolitical context).

I will make the case that we often stick to a flawed model of communication when we disseminate the results of physics education research (PER) to teachers. We have a similar problem to those who study climate change or tobacco epidemiology; we have data that we think should effect behavior change (i.e., instruction). Why doesn't it? While many instructors are aware of the instructional techniques that PER has demonstrated to be effective, research is showing that many instructors may miss the point of these methods, or quit using them after just one semester. Just as climate scientists have needed to become versed in public communication, so do we need to become versed in communication with our audience (physicists). I will outline some of the lessons we can learn from the research and practice of public science communication, and discuss the power and limits of communication in effecting behavior change.

Science educators often want professional development to increase the extent to which teachers attend to the disciplinary substance of K-12 students' ideas, see themselves as participants in the construction of scientific knowledge, and autonomously formulate relevant questions about physical scenarios. The PER community has some evidence for teacher growth in these areas, and the Energy Project at SPU is seeking to discern how such growth manifests itself. In doing so, we hope to develop new ways of assessing K-12 teacher professional development. These new assessments will add to existing assessments of K-12 teachers' conceptual understanding of physics, beliefs/attitudes about science, or use of inquiry in the classroom (e.g., open-ended conceptual assessments; the FCI; the CLASS and the MPEX; or the RTOP, respectively).

An ongoing concern within the PER community is how to promote the use of PER-based instructional strategies by non-PER college faculty. Three current trends suggest that PER has an opportunity to influence teaching practice by focusing more attention on assessment: 1) our research and that of others has found that neither faculty nor their institutions are satisfied with the way teaching is assessed; 2) the lack of ability to assess teaching effectiveness has been cited as a barrier to faculty use of research-based instructional strategies; and 3) current trends in higher education are encouraging institutions to pay more attention to assessing student learning outcomes. This talk will describe what PER currently knows about the assessment of student learning, some assessment trends outside of PER, and potentially productive ways for PER to influence the discussion about assessment.

Common representations of energy in physics, including bar charts, graphs of energy vs. time, and pie charts, promote quantitative calculations of relative amounts of energy that are present in a system at a given moment. The Energy Project at Seattle Pacific University has developed a family of representations that enforce energy conservation while enabling detailed modeling of energy dynamics, particularly the complex transfers and transformations of energy that take place during real physical events. These representations variously use human bodies, computer animation, wooden cubes, and graphic diagrams to represent units of energy during dynamic processes in physical phenomena. Each representation provides a unique framework for collaborative construction of physics ideas. We provide evidence that these representations are not only expressive but are also rigorous in the sense that their disciplined application raises new questions about the phenomena being represented.

We compare students' problem-solving strategies when completing tasks with the same representational format across two topical areas, kinematics and work. We individually interviewed a cohort of 19 engineering students completing 10 tasks over three sessions. The tasks were structured in linguistic, graphical and symbolic forms requesting either qualitative or quantitative solutions. We used a holistic approach to analyze the data focusing on whether students employed a quantitative or qualitative strategy, formulated a description or an explanation and included equations or visual representations in the problem solution. We found that the students were inconsistent in their approach for interpreting and solving problems with the same representation across the two topical areas. The mainly symbolic problem representation and level of prior knowledge influence students' strategies, their written responses and ability to recognize qualitative ways to attempt a problem.

At CU-Boulder, we have begun efforts to develop student-centered instruction in upper-division classical mechanics courses for physics majors. Part of this work requires investigations of student difficulties with particular concepts, models and tasks. Student use of Taylor series (an indispensable tool for practicing physicists) offers a unique look into how students separate math from physics. We have explored the difficulties that students exhibit when invoking, using, and discussing Taylor series as they relate to physical problems. Our investigations included classroom observations, students' homework performance, and out-of-class interviews. Our work implies the need for a stronger math-physics connection when teaching students to employ Taylor series. This work was supported by the University of Colorado's Science Education Initiative.

Many foreign students in our district have been and are placed into a high school physics class because of their math skills and an assumption that vocabulary is less important than other courses. This has led to some interesting situations when dealing with ELL students. This talk will address that what a student may actually hear when direct instruction is used to explain concepts is different than what is intended. Some students do not have the necessary phonemes in their native language and are not use to hearing certain sounds. Thus misunderstanding and misconceptions can occur. It will also suggest some strategies to make Physics comprehensible for ELL students.

The Test of Understanding Graphs in Kinematics (TUG-K) has informed the instruction of introductory physics for nearly two decades. One of this test's early discoveries was the student tendency to calculate a one-point slope. Even if the tangent line does not originate at the origin, students will often compute the slope at a point by simply dividing a single y-value by a single x-value. In our sample of introductory physics students taught the past few years by four different instructors all utilizing Modeling-based Instruction, we found an improved success rate on TUG-K items probing the one-point slope phenomenon. Yet, student success still remained below 50% on these items. This year we have developed a greater variety of slope calculation activities and assessments for our students, in hopes of further remediating this persistent issue. We will present our post-test findings in this talk.

Formal solution evaluation strategies, such as limiting case analysis and dimensional analysis, are valuable skills for physics students to develop. As a first step in developing instructional methods to improve these skills, we investigate student strategies for checking and evaluating solutions to physics problems during the solution process and after an answer is obtained. We collected written solutions and video data from students enrolled in calculus-based introductory mechanics and electricity and magnetism. Students exhibited basic checking, such as rereading the problem statement or givens, as well as more sophisticated checking, such as viewing the problem and results in a new representation. Students also showed a willingness to initiate checking strategies even when they were unable to obtain a conclusive result.

We describe the implementation and assessment of computational modeling in a ninth-grade classroom in the context of the Arizona Modeling Instruction physics curriculum. Using a high-level programming environment (VPython), students develop computational models to predict the motion of objects under a variety of physical situations (e.g., constant net force), to simulate real-world phenomenon (e.g., car crash), and to visualize abstract quantities (e.g., acceleration). The impact of teaching computation is evaluated through a proctored assignment that asks the students to complete a provided program to represent the correct motion. The students are given an open-ended essay question that asks them to explain the steps they would use to model a physical situation. We also investigate the attitudes and prior experiences of each student using the Computation Modeling in Physics Attitudinal Student Survey (COMPASS) developed at Georgia Tech as well as a prior computational experiences survey.

Concepts on mechanical waves have been investigated to undergraduate students in introductory physics courses by using the MWCS (Mechanical Wave Conceptual Survey) tool. It consists of a total of 22 questions in wave propagation, superposition, reflection, and standing wave parts. Students have difficulties in traveling of a pulse wave and a standing wave. The types of misconception could be grouped into work-and-energy connected model, dualistic thinking model, particle-pulse wave model, amplitude-dependent model, immature conceptual model, categorical conceptual model, and force-and-motion model. We will introduce various types of misconception in detail.

Student development of scientific reasoning is at least as important as certain science content knowledge. This statement is made not only in regards to national attention on promoting 21st century skills for global competitiveness, but also in reference to research that demonstrates that students with formal reasoning patterns are more proficient learners. Unfortunately, students enter higher education with wide variations in scientific reasoning abilities, and these skills are not typically targeted in the college curriculum. In this talk I share the scientific reasoning abilities, as measured by Lawson's Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning, for a wide variety of majors and show that the typical college course does not impact these skills. This talk provides the rationale for the inclusion of learning objectives in our courses that promote the development of more formal reasoning. Examples of pedagogies and curricula shown to be effective in developing student scientific reasoning abilities will be provided.

Student reasoning difficulties with interpreting and applying multi-variable expressions have been reported previously. For example, students tend to treat the relationship between the wavelength, propagation speed, and frequency as a mathematical identity. That often leads to erroneous conclusions such as "the frequency is changed by changing the speed." We extended this investigation to the contexts of electric field, electric potential, and capacitance. A variety of questions were designed that required students to analyze relationships between various quantities. Significant differences in student reasoning approaches were identified that appeared to depend on whether (1) information presented to students was given in written text and the written text was explicitly translated to the mathematical expression(s) in standard symbolic form or (2) the information was presented in the written form only.

Conceptual blending theory (CBT)[1] offers an elaborate theoretical apparatus for explaining how the human imagination creates unreal situations that, by their relations to reality, teach us about reality. In these imaginary blended situations, we establish new correspondences, interactions, and dynamics, and the outcomes of the dynamics lend insight to the nature of various real situations that were used to compose the unreal blend. The general idea of CBT has charmed the PER community for a few years, but it has gained little traction in affecting how we do business, perhaps because we have not demanded more from the theory in its relation to our data. In this presentation, we attempt to test some of the finer points of CBT by challenging it to explain Energy Theater[2], both generally in terms of the design of the activity, and specifically in terms of the actual interactions of participants in one episode.

The purpose of this study is to investigate student learning of Newtonian Mechanics through the study of its history and the development of the relevant ideas since the time of ancient Greece. The hypothesis is that not only will students learn the basic concepts of mechanics, but they also will develop a more positive attitude and appreciation for physics. To assess the students' conceptual understanding, we administer Force Concept Inventory (FCI) and for the measurement of student attitude change, we employed the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS); both were given as pre- and post-tests. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, a survey was given out to see how students perceived the different course components and which ones they found helpful in their learning. This paper will present our preliminary results on such a study.

We investigated whether the brain type is a good predictor of students' conceptions of and approaches to learning science. The inventory instruments used for our study were the systemizing quotient and the empathy quotient for measuring the brain type, the questionnaire on the conceptions of learning science, the questionnaire on the approaches to learning science. Our result showed that there was a highly significant positive correlation between D, which is the difference between SQ and EQ, and conceptions of and approaches to learning science. The highly significant positive correlation also appeared between C, which is the sum of SQ and EQ, and conceptions of and approaches to learning science. The EQ is as important a factor in science learning as SQ. Therefore we need to regard the brain type as one of the important student characters.

We will present the analysis of student responses to a survey designed to test their understanding of and ability to use the Dirac delta function to solve problems in an upper division electrodynamics course. Students were asked to solve three different problems involving the Delta function, and to articulate the reasoning they were using to solve the problem. Results indicate that: 1. students view two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems as independent concepts rather than one being a special case of the other. 2. Students understand the Dirac delta function as acting as a "localization operator", but are not able to employ the delta function in a mathematically formal way. 3. Students view the Dirac delta function as similar to the Kronecker delta. Namely that it is a piecewise continuous function.

The Physics Education Group at the University of Washington often reports the results of pre-tests given in many sections of the same course, with the total number of student responses numbering in the hundreds or even thousands. Many variables associated with pre-test administration and prior instruction could, in principle, affect student performance. With results available from a large number of sections, it is possible to characterize the typical variation quantitatively, and to identify variables that may be important.

We investigate student conceptual understanding of the relationships between the directions of net force, velocity, and acceleration in one dimension and report on data collected from over 650 students. Unlike previous work, we simultaneously studied all six possible conditional relations between force, velocity, and acceleration in order to obtain a coherent picture of student understanding of the relations between all three concepts. We found that there were asymmetries in responding to conditional relations. For example, students answered questions of the form "Given the velocity, what can be inferred about the net force?'' differently than converse questions: "Given the net force, what can be inferred about the velocity?'' Additionally, there was evidence of hierarchies in student responses, suggesting for example that understanding the relation between velocity and acceleration is necessary for understanding the relation between velocity and force, but the converse is not true.

Among the many student difficulties addressed by PER, misconceptions stemming from "mis-ontologies" "incorrect views about what kind of entity a given quantity *is* " are viewed by some researchers as particularly pernicious. For instance, some researchers argue that viewing force as a kind of substance ("stuff") carried by an object is particularly harmful to productive conceptual development, and hence, learners should be guided away from such conceptions [1]. While acknowledging that force is not a substance, we dispute the claim that substance-based metaphors for force hinder conceptual development. We present data from a teacher professional development workshop, where a group of elementary school science teachers start from substance-based metaphors for gravity to build a sophisticated Galilean explanation for why objects of different masses accelerate at the same rate due to gravity. Instructional interventions should tap these productive substance-based ways of thinking rather than categorizing them as pure misconceptions.

As post-secondary education budgets grow ever tighter, universities are often adopting undesirable measures to cope with a lack of funds. At North Dakota State University, our introductory physics courses have been without the benefit of recitation sessions due to a lack of appropriated funds. The calculus-based sequence is composed solely of four 50-minute lectures per week. This fits a traditional model of lecture-based physics instruction to the letter, but presents numerous limitations for an instructor who recognizes the benefits of creating interactive environments within a course. I will present a number of methods being employed in the first-semester course--including the adaptation of research-validated tutorials for the lecture environment--and student data on several summative assessments that demonstrate the level of success to date.

As a part of a multi-year investigation of student understanding of mechanical waves in introductory courses, a set of tutorials1 on wave behavior at a boundary has been developed. However, even after the targeted instruction many students still are not able to systematically analyze complex unfamiliar situations. We hypothesized that poor performance on some post-tests may be attributable to difficulties in visualizing and reasoning spatially about transformations in the shape of a spring that occur over time as a complex pulse reflects from a boundary. We probed the extent to which student performance hinges on their abilities to visualize and reason spatially by examining the degree of association between student performance on the post-tests and on a spatial visualization test (paper folding test).

We report the results of a study on the effect of problem format on students' answers. In particular, we studied their ability to explain their reasoning and demonstrate the use of a logical problem solving process based on the physics principles they have learned. The same problem written in multiple formats was administered as a quiz in the large introductory physics sections in both the algebra-based and calculus-based classes. The formats included multiple choice only, multiple choice and explain your reasoning, explain your reasoning only, ranking and explaining your reasoning, and a few others. We present the results.

Research has highlighted students' difficulties with integration in physics problems. We present a teaching experiment with six lessons about integration in an introductory mechanics context using a reformed instructional approach. During these lessons, the instructor guided discussion, but did not lecture. Students considered "debate problems," in which they read a discussion between fictitious students and attempted to draw conclusions about the merits of the students' claims. Participants communicated with one another in multiple ways. They discussed physics while writing on whiteboards at their tables of four, then each table made a presentation to the other table using their whiteboard, and finally they recorded individual written and audio presentations using a smartpen. This "pencast" presentation was later reviewed and critiqued by other students as well as by the student who created it. We qualitatively analyze the pencasts, and consider the students, learning progress.

Research in physics education came of age in the context of introductory-level courses that serve students who are primarily non-physics majors. More recently, a number of researchers have extended this focus into the middle- and upper-division courses taken by physics majors. The apparent assumption in standard courses at this level has been that these students are well-matched to the lecture-based traditional curriculum and that understanding would naturally follow from mastery of mathematical techniques. In this talk, we examine these assumptions and document the response of physics majors in an upper-division course to research-based instructional strategies and standard and modified assessment strategies.

Proportional reasoning is sometimes treated as a monolithic ability that "switches on" at a particular stage of development. However, results from research in both mathematics and physics education suggest that proportional reasoning is multi-faceted and often context-dependent. A collaborative project between Western Washington University, Rutgers University, and New Mexico State University seeks to develop and assess classroom activities to promote student facility with ratio reasoning. This talk will provide a brief outline of the project and present an example of assessing student reasoning.

Inquiry-based instruction has been shown to lead to large gains in both content knowledge as well as scientific reasoning ability. It is of great interest to understand factors that contribute to these gains. The success of diverse populations within an inquiry-based learning environment is related to a large set of variables which include initial reasoning ability, content knowledge, mathematical background, and demographic factors. The role of different factors in the group-based course is identified, such as group work, individual exercises, journaling, instructor intervention, and hands-on activities. Comparison will be made between cohorts who include high school students, pre-service teachers, in-service teachers, and GEC students.

A novel instrument for physics education research called the Torque Judgment Task (TJT) was developed to assess students' ability to determine the relative torques felt when tilting bicycle wheel gyroscopes, an apparatus commonly used in introductory physics courses to demonstrate properties of torque and angular momentum. Results from laboratory experiments involving dual-wheel gyroscopes show that individuals who play active roles in manipulating the gyroscope apparatus show more improvement on the TJT than those who participate solely as observers, especially on problems related to angular momentum vector addition and cancellation. A laboratory activity for introductory physics based around these experimental results was also designed in an effort to leverage theories of embodied cognition (the idea that our physical experiences can improve learning by grounding our understanding of abstract concepts -- e.g. torque and angular momentum -- in concrete physical terms) in teaching and learning about the vector nature of torque and angular momentum.

We are re-examining the seminal paper by Chi et al., which firmly established the notion that novices categorize physics problems by "surface features" (e.g. "incline," "pendulum," "projectile motion," ...), while experts use "deep structure" (e.g., "energy conservation," "Newton 2," ...). The paper has been cited over 3000 times in scholarly articles over a wide range of disciplines. We replicated the experiment with an expert group and a novice group, using a set of 50 problems. The expert-novice distinction between sorters is highly sensitive to the choice of problems in the categorization set and we will discuss the features of the problems that do a good job of distinguishing expert from novice.

Students have difficulties comprehending science texts. The interrogation method, which prompts students to read sentences from the text and answer, "Why is this true?" has been developed to enhance students' ability to read science texts. To enact this method, instructors must choose sentences that are both important conceptually and deeply interrogatable. We explored the use of this method in an introductory physics course for non-physics majors. The teaching assistants (pre-service teachers), learning assistants (undergraduates), and the course instructor chose sentences for each chapter of the text, and the students were asked to interrogate two to four of the sentences in each chapter. We analyzed the conceptual importance of the sentences and their interrogatability, based on underlying epistemologies. We then interviewed the course instructor to determine how he chose the interrogatable sentences. Based on analysis of the chosen sentences and interview responses, we developed a model for choosing productive sentences to interrogate.

A team of discipline-based educational researchers at North Dakota State University has been using Bloom's taxonomy as a basis for characterizing the cognitive levels required by students (1) to learn subject matter in college-level science courses and (2) to demonstrate acquired knowledge and skills on exams. Exam problems were used as a data source for both categories. Correlation between student performance and cognitive level was measured. To gain a deeper understanding of student learning, exam problems were further categorized according to the number of reasoning steps required to arrive to an answer; the level of abstraction represented in the problem; and whether or not a solution hinges on visualization and/or spatial reasoning skills. Results relevant to students' learning in introductory physics courses will be presented.

Students' sometimes contradictory ideas about ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and the nature of chemical bonds have been studied in the biology and chemistry education literature, but these topics are rarely part of the introductory physics curriculum. We present qualitative data from an introductory physics course for undergraduate biology majors that seeks to build greater interdisciplinary coherence and therefore includes these topics. In these data, students grapple with the apparent contradiction between the energy released when the phosphate bond in ATP is broken and the idea that an energy input is required to break a bond. We see that students' perceptions of how each scientific discipline bounds the system of interest can influence how they justify their reasoning about a topic that crosses disciplines. Building interdisciplinary coherence requires attending to these interdisciplinary issues, as part of both curriculum design and education research.

Students come to any physics course with expectations about the world and about science. Those expectations have an influence on the way that students make observations, reason about phenomena, and draw conclusions. In certain situations, those expectations may be inconsistent with those of the physics community and lead to results that are inconsistent with the body of knowledge in physics. We designed a new group problem-solving activity on damped harmonic motion that supports students in finding coherence between multiple representations through discussion of their known models and observations of an underdamped oscillating system. During the activity, students typically showed appropriate expectations when finding coherence between symbolic, graphical, and qualitative representations, but showed inappropriate expectations about problem solving. We will discuss how students' expectations about the starting point of physics problem solving affect their attempts to achieve coherence and draw conclusions.

This study examines how graduate students become physics experts in a physics research group using Wenger's apprenticeship framework within a Community of Practice. For an individual, the process of social reconfiguration is a matter of identity development through participation. We analyze data from an ethnographic case study of a biophysics research group with two professors and four graduate students. Data consist of six months of participant observations and video recordings of the group's research meetings, interviews, document analysis, and two months of observations a year later. We present how students' development of community membership is a matter of identification, how an individual is recognized or labeled, and negotiability, how individuals position themselves based on their abilities to negotiate meaning in an interaction. Differences in members' ability to negotiate in an interaction informs us of their evolving position within the research group and the acknowledgement of their abilities and technical expertise.

Students in introductory physics courses have been often found to struggle with problem-solving skills. This difficulty seems to stem not only from their mathematical skills but also from the ability to comprehend and utilize physics concepts to solve problems. A main source of difficulty seems to be analytical reasoning! We can make our teaching more effective by studying students' strengths and weaknesses to develop a comprehensive teaching strategy that promotes better learning. Our study looked at students taking a second-semester studio mode algebra-based physics course. This presentation will share data highlighting several important aspects of students' understanding of physics concepts, mathematical skills and problem solving strategies, and will compare students' abilities to solve "condensed" problems versus more directed problems consisting of sub-parts. This information has implications about the possibility that students know the subject matter, but have difficulty synthesizing the information to get to the final answer.

Our research group is developing a standardized fluids assessment, covering buoyancy and pressure. Much of the prior research of student difficulties with pressure involves younger children. Many of the questions on the beta-version of the assessment used this past year were designed to test the prevalence of those difficulties in college students. In this talk we will describe the pressure-related assessment questions, the misconceptions they probe, and the preliminary results from the beta version of the assessment.

Clickers, while perhaps not ubiquitous, have become very common in introductory physics classes where the audience is composed of students from a variety of majors. They have also begun to see use in upper-division physics courses where the audience is almost entirely physics majors. In this presentation we examine the hypothesis that these substantially different populations will result in different levels of participation and engagement. We have videotaped the audiences of two introductory physics courses and two junior-level physics courses (mechanics and E&M; in both cases) during clicker questions and quantified the level of engagement in each. Preliminary results suggest that upper-division majors-only courses exhibit more peer-to-peer interaction and overall engagement than introductory courses.

A substantial number of studies in the cognitive sciences have established that color, acting as an environmental cue, can significantly affect subject performance on a variety of tasks. However, there is a dearth of research into how this phenomenon manifests itself in 1) the combined conceptual and computational field of physics and 2) the context of preparation (i.e. where subjects prepare for relevant material prior to assessment as opposed to remaining ignorant of the tasks' nature until immediately before assessment). Our experiment involves approximately 450 students in an introductory E&M; course in which the paper color used for examinations was varied. Analysis includes raw exam scores and differentiates between students' multiple choice, written response, conceptual, and computational performance. Additionally, we report on the time students require to complete exams and their confidence levels prior to and immediately following assessment.

Graphs play an important role in all of the sciences, as well as in daily life. Introductory Physics classes are a good place to teach students how to connect graphs to the real world. The obvious question becomes, "What is the best way to teach students to read and use graphs correctly?" This talk will compare student learning of graphs with construction-based homework problems versus with interpretation-based homework problems. This research was carried out using both computer-based (in an online course management system, namely LON-CAPA) and paper-based problems.

As part of a larger study of mathematics in physics problem solving, this project was designed to examine how students are able to identify similarities between purely mathematics and physics problems. Students were given a set of math problems and then physics problems, in succession. For each set, they were asked to group the problems based on similarities. The results of this study indicate that students are able to detect nuances in the purely mathematical problems that they may miss in an analogous physics problem, despite extensive prompting. This talk will present the larger set of results from this study.

In the Maine Physical Sciences Partnership, we are studying middle school teachers' knowledge of their students' thinking about energy. Building a survey from scratch might require extensive original research, but a bank of questions at the appropriate grade-level exists online at the AAAS assessment website (http://assessment.aaas.org/). The website provides both questions and student data of common incorrect answers. We chose from these questions to design a written survey given to both students and teachers. Teachers were asked to answer the questions on their own and also to predict how their students might most commonly answer. We used one-on-one interviews with both students and teachers to validate the original survey. We present data on teacher content knowledge as well as teacher knowledge of student ideas. We observed a ceiling effect for teachers on content understanding, suggesting the survey is too easy. We also found good examples of predictions of student thinking.

While research has established the effectiveness of reform physics curricula, less well-studied is how different faculty, with varying pedagogical content knowledge, use these materials. We characterize the diversity of practice in workshop-style introductory physics courses through two complementary observational protocols: the Reform Teaching Observation Protocol assesses fidelity to reform-teaching philosophies, while the Teaching Dimension Observation Protocol records direct practice. Despite a common environment and core materials, there is significant variance across faculty and course content. Instructors in electricity and magnetism courses not only lecture more frequently, they lecture to prepare student activities ("Tell and Practice"), whereas mechanics instructors use lecture to summarize student findings ("Invent and Tell"). We find no significant difference in practice during weekly sessions when the class meets in a traditional setting (stadium seating, well-defined front, etc); faculty treat both environments as an essentially interactive lecture. I'll also discuss implications for future dissemination efforts.

We analyze coherence-seeking in on-going student activity from a video-recorded discussion section. Here, students engage in a task designed to build connections between physics and biology. We present evidence of students 1) spontaneously bringing in unanticipated outside knowledge into their reasoning in this physics course and 2) seeking connections between the course material and other things they know. Throughout this process, we examine both implicit and explicit indexing of the disciplines throughout the reasoning episode to show that often these connections span disciplinary boundaries. Independent of whether reconciliation is achieved, we see coherence-seeking reasoning practices that students are engaged in as essential to scientific practice and as such we claim that those practices should be a focus of our assessment efforts.

It has been proposed that "eye catching" features in some physics problems, that are also plausible and relevant, automatically capture students' attention. Other less salient features have little opportunity to be considered. So, students answer the problem based on the most perceptually salient elements of the problem (Heckler, 2011). To test this hypothesis we recorded eye movements of introductory physics students on a set of problems with diagrams. Each diagram contained areas consistent with documented novice-like answers and areas consistent with the scientifically correct answer. We manipulated the luminance contrast of the diagrams to produce three versions of each diagram, which differed by the area with the highest level of perceptual salience. We discuss how the salience manipulations are related to the correctness of answers and eye movements. These results allow us to understand how perceptual salience in a problem diagram influences student answer choice and attention.

We present a qualitative analysis of a group of students working through a task designed to build connections between biology, chemistry, and physics. During the discussion, members of the group explicitly index some of the ideas being presented as coming from "chemistry" and from "physics.'' While there is evidence that students seek coherence between outside knowledge and in-class knowledge, there is little evidence of reasoning with one another's ideas, resulting in a lack of reconciliation. In this talk we present evidence that the difficulty students face in trying to reconcile each other's ideas can be understood through a positional identity lens. We examine how students position themselves and each other as experts and novices in the disciplines. We argue that this disciplinary positioning contributes to the lack of the reconciliation of ideas for these students.

While teaching assistants may still be developing their beliefs about and skills in teaching and communicating physics, they also may be the most approachable or accessible physics experts for students in large-enrollment introductory courses. For example, the student-teacher ratio in our lecture sections is about 250-1, while the ratio in our lab sections is about 30-1. As we are in the process of reforming our introductory courses and laboratories as well as our TA training program, we began by asking the TAs about their views and experiences on both the teaching and training processes. Our TAs come from diverse cultural, teaching, and research backgrounds. All were teaching the laboratories associated with algebra-based courses. We will discuss trends in the TAs' responses to questions about the purpose of the laboratory component, their roles as TAs, their own strengths and weaknesses, and their efforts to improve their teaching skills.

We compare students' problem-solving strategies when completing tasks with the same representational format across two topical areas, kinematics and work. We individually interviewed 19 engineering students completing 10 tasks over three sessions. The tasks were structured in linguistic, graphical and symbolic forms requesting either qualitative or quantitative solutions. The analysis focused on the characteristics (description versus explanation) of the qualitative solution. We also compared the strategies used when attempting tasks asking for qualitative or quantitative solutions, with respect to the representational format. We found that the students were inconsistent in their approach for interpreting the same representation across the two topical areas. The nature of the task's solution does not seem to influence students' strategy for tasks in the symbolic form, but it seems to influence their strategy for kinematics tasks in a graphical form.

Studies outside of physics education research have found that students tend to solve problems in concrete, familiar representations more accurately than in an abstract representation for relatively simple problems. First, we replicate this finding for some simple physics problems. However, we also find that when a specific problem commonly elicits prior knowledge that is contrary to scientific knowledge, e.g. a scientific "misconception," the concrete representation invokes incorrect answers more frequently than abstract representations. Second, we find that students with higher final course grades perform disproportionally better on abstract problems compared to concrete problems. Thus, from a psychometric perspective, abstract problems would be preferable over concrete because the former is more efficient at discriminating between students. However, from a pedagogical perspective, this study suggests that concrete problem representations are important for determining whether both high and low grade students have overcome the relevant scientific misconceptions.

At Florida International University we are developing a curriculum guide and set of comprehensive video and digital resources to support the implementation of Modeling Instruction. In preparation for dissemination of the curriculum materials and instructor support guide, we pilot tested the curriculum guide. An instructor with no previous experience teaching introductory physics using Modeling Instruction utilized the curriculum guide and instructor resources. To better understand how to support Modeling Instruction curriculum use, we conducted interviews with the instructor during and after the semester. We have identified three types of instructional resources germane to implementing Modeling Instruction. The instructor brought considerable resources based on prior teaching experiences. Several resources were developed during the instruction with assistance of the curriculum materials. Finally, several resources were not developed. We investigate the role that these resources play in instruction and how to structure faculty professional development that supports the development of instructional resources.

Characterizing faculty expectations is important to produce a comprehensive understanding of what knowledge and skills students should acquire before and during a quantum mechanics course (QMC). We describe interviews conducted with faculty members in the Physics & Astronomy Department of Georgia State University. These interviews probe faculty members' expectations of senior undergraduate students' background in mathematics, physics, and quantum mechanics concepts before entering a QMC. The interviews we conducted may provide students with a "map" for areas that will help strengthen the knowledge and skills obtained in their QMC. We will report on faculty members views on optimal preparation for an undergraduate student entering a QMC and appropriate learning goals for a student completing a QMC.

The LivePhoto Physics Group has begun developing and evaluating a series of short single topic video expositions for introductory students that incorporate video analysis activities. These vignettes are designed for web delivery as ungraded exercises to supplement textbook reading, or serve as pre-lecture or pre-laboratory activities. Each vignette combines narration, a real-world video segment, and video analysis tools designed to enable students to master concepts or learn data collection and analysis techniques. As part of this work the team is developing new techniques for web-based educational research that allows for the collection of data on student learning and motivation. Details of the interactive video vignette for projectile motion will be presented along with results of a pilot study that investigated the efficacy of techniques for motivating students to complete the vignette. The study involved multiple sections of calculus- and algebra-based physics courses across several institutions.

Efforts to improve teaching in higher education have often focused on individual faculty. However, there is a growing consensus that the academic department is a more productive focus of change initiatives. The difficulty for change agents working with departments is to find ways to allow faculty members to maintain autonomy to develop emergent ideas while simultaneously allowing departmental leaders to maintain control and provide direction. Complexity leadership theory combines ideas from complexity science and social network analysis to help organizations better understand how to manage the emergent and prescribed polarities necessary for successful change. This talk will introduce the ideas of complexity leadership theory and illustrate their utility to department-level instructional change through the use of social network analysis applied to an academic department.

There is ongoing discussion of the extent to which specific strands of teacher professional development influence student learning. We describe research efforts exploring the roles of teacher content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge, particularly teacher knowledge of student ideas (KSI), in the context of the Maine Physical Sciences Partnership (MainePSP). The primary focus of the MainePSP is the professional development of physical science instructors in grades 6-9 via curriculum renewal using common instructional resources across multiple school districts.This particular study looks to assess teacher content knowledge and KSI in order to explore their respective effects on student learning in specific contexts, including density and mechanics. We will describe our methods, present preliminary results, and outline recommendations for further investigation.

Developing the skills to set up integrals is critical for students' success in calculus-based physics. It requires a high level of understanding of both math and physics concepts. Previous studies have investigated students' poor performance when solving integration problems in the context of electricity and magnetism. However, the reasons for students' difficulties have not been explored in detail. We used the theoretical framework of epistemic games to describe students' use of integration in physics E&M; topics. We conducted eight interview sessions with 13 engineering students enrolled in a second-semeter introductory calculus-based physics course. We categorize the epistemic games played by the students and described these games in terms of students' moves and knowledge resources associated with these moves. Finally, we discuss how our findings could be used to explain why students encounter the difficulties they do.

In traditional coursework, students' problem-solving ability is often assessed solely on the basis of the correctness of their written equations or their numerical answer. Reformed curricula frequently make use of more complex rubrics which may examine students' use of diagrams, ability to plan a solution before performing numerical calculations, or adherence to a certain solution format. Students' oral presentations provide us with a rich data set for assessing their understanding. One advantage of the oral presentation is that the creation of diagrams and graphs is synchronized with spoken words, allowing us to closely examine the correspondences between these representations. We will discuss a method of assessment that makes use of these correspondences. This work supported in part by NSF grant 0816207.

Instructors frequently observe that students often have significant difficulty activating relevant physics knowledge that they seemingly possess during problem solving. We propose that at least part of the difficulty might be caused by the conventional graphical representation used in teaching these concepts. Most conventional physics representations are developed under the physical limits of pen and paper, and are not optimized to facilitate sense making among novices. When examined from a grounded cognition perspective, some of these representations may interfere with students' proper construction of conceptual understanding, thereby encouraging shallow/rote learning of physics rules. Physics rules learned by rote require a more precise matching of surface features to activate, and pose a higher cognitive cost during implementation. In a clinical study, we demonstrated that by improving the design of physics representation using computer animation, we can change the physics rules activated by students solving certain capacitor circuit problems. Interestingly, this improved design of the representation shares less surface feature similarity with the problem body when compared to the conventional representation and students are observed to spend less time watching the improved design.

In the fall of 2010 the University of Illinois implemented a new online homework system, Smartphysics, for introductory physics classes. Smartphysics includes new features such as instant feedback specialized to unique student mistakes, which can help correct small mathematical mistakes as well as conceptual ones. Another feature is the ability to delay feedback on certain questions until after that homework's deadline, acting as an in-the-moment assessment of student performance. This can act as formative assessment for students, and might lead to a way to offer students a prediction of their performance on subsequent exams. Results concerning student behavior and the correlation of performance on delayed feedbacks to other variables will be shown.

Repeated investigations have confirmed some consistent difficulties among students in upper-level thermal physics courses. These difficulties include confusion regarding the state-function property of entropy, misinterpretations of the meaning of equilibrium in the context of available microstates, misunderstandings of free-expansion processes, and lack of clarity regarding ideal ("Carnot") efficiency of heat engines. I will discuss these difficulties and related student ideas in the context of development of research-based instructional materials.

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) is an extremely useful computational tool widely used for solving various physics problems. It is implicitly invoked in the evaluation of integral problems. Research in mathematics education has documented student difficulties with the underlying concepts of the FTC. We are investigating student difficulties with the FTC, and extending the work in mathematics to include relevant situations in physics. Questions administered as written surveys and individual interviews in calculus-based introductory physics and multivariable calculus classes focused on the determination of signs of integrals, primarily in graphical representations. Negative integrals in particular provided a rich context for FTC application. We find that students use the FTC as a computational tool without understanding the underlying concepts. One observed difficulty is an operational confusion between the function endpoints and the antiderivative endpoints when determining the integral signs.

Administering the CLASS to students in the mainstream freshman mechanics course at MIT yields significant negative shifts in all the categories related to problem solving and conceptual understanding. These shifts are consistent with the observations published by the creators of the CLASS. In the MIT sample, these shifts can be ascribed to five statements that unambiguously assess student self-confidence. No substantial shift is observed in statements assessing students' conception of what constitutes problem-solving expertise. By contrast, students enrolled in calculus-based introductory mechanics at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville, a small state engineering school, enter the course with significantly lower rates of expert-like responses in the non-self-confidence statements but similar levels of self-confidence, and leave the course without a significant shift in either category of statements. Substantial remediation of the drop in MIT student self-confidence statements has been achieved by a three-week ReView course employing Modeling Applied to Problem Solving (MAPS) pedagogy.

Using data collected from a nationally representative sample of college freshmen (NSF Grant # 1036617), the evaluation of high school physics teachers by their students is examined. Prior research in this area has found gender bias amongst (both male and female) students with respect to the gender of their teacher, so special attention is paid to gender and gender-interaction effects. Pedagogical practices that may moderate students' evaluations are also considered. The implications of this research for our understanding of physics culture regarding students' gendered expectations of teacher behavior and students' choices toward their continued physics participation is discussed.

We have previously reported that, when given a single force opposite to the direction of motion, students were more likely to invoke a "force-of-motion" than when given two forces, one force in the direction of motion and a larger force opposite. Here we elaborate on this finding, reporting on student responses from a set of contextual situations with varying numbers of forces on an object, both in the direction of motion and opposite to the direction of motion. This comparison allows for a better understanding of the students' perceptions of the similarities and differences between net force and force-of-motion. This also allows for a better understanding of the nature of the well-known student confusion between force and velocity. Results indicate that attention must be paid to various combinations of forces so that students may better understand the concept of net force and overcome the incorrect notion of force-of-motion.

In this talk I will analyze how students in a constructive whole-class discussion come to consensus around defining "physics model." This discussion occurred as part of an elective freshman course at the University of California, Berkeley which is taught as part of The Compass Project, a program that supports physical science students. The course had students explore physics models through open-ended research questions around the ray model of light. On the first day of class, students argued around and unpacked important components of physics models in order to define physics models broadly. I will identify and characterize the "consensus building moves" which are statements that participants made in the course of the conversation. Using this coding scheme, I will look for patterns in student argumentation. Finally, I will discuss resonances between ideas that came up in the student discussion and within interviews with physics faculty.

Synthesis and evaluation of research on at-risk student interventions signals the need for more rigorous delineation of the characteristics involved in intervention effectiveness. Systematic links to and manipulation of the major theoretical factors underlying these interventions must also be elaborated and studied in greater detail. Such was the purpose of this study, which was undertaken in the context of two interventional approaches: a pre-course and a course offered concurrent to enrollment in the target introductory mechanics course at a large Midwestern university. Participants were engineering freshmen with the prerequisite calculus credit. The quasi-experimental, post-test only, nonequivalent control group design utilizes propensity score matching to assess the differential impacts of the two approaches on at-risk student performance and persistence in the target course as well as retention rates in the related physics course sequence.

A troubleshooting activity was carried out by an e-tutor in two steps. First the student diagnoses a mistaken statement attributed to the virtual student "Danny," then the student compares his/her own diagnosis to an exemplary diagnosis provided by the e-tutor. These steps are based on three design principles: 1) Eliciting common misinterpretations. 2) Incorporating knowledge integration processes. 3) Inspiring a non-judgmental argumentative environment. These activities aim to provide students with ample opportunities to recognize, acknowledge, and attempt to resolve conflicts between possible interpretations of scientific concepts and principles. This talk will focus on the design of the artifacts implemented in these activities (mistaken statements and exemplary diagnoses) and the methodology used to explore the following questions: To what extent do knowledge integration processes take place? How do students make use of the opportunities provided by the activity to negotiate and possibly elaborate alternative interpretations of physics concepts and principles?

The concept of energy is becoming an increasingly important topic in the K-12 curriculum. We are in the process of developing a Physics by Inquiry[1] module on energy that is designed to help teachers deepen their understanding of this abstract concept. The curriculum emphasizes how experimental results can motivate the construction of a scientific model for energy. It also provides teachers with direct experience in inquiry-based learning that can be used as a guide for teaching through a process of inquiry in their own classrooms. We discuss results from our preliminary investigation that illustrate the extent to which teachers and students are able to relate energy concepts to real-world observations.

Building on the work of the Physics Education Research community, we have implemented pedagogical changes in the way the introductory physics sequences are taught at Stanford. Instead of the previous instructor-centered approach, we use student-centered, active-learning strategies in discussion sections and laboratories. The change in section style has necessitated a change in our TA training programs. We will compare different TA training approaches that we have used with varying levels of success. These include practicum versus theory-based sessions and day-long boot camps versus weekly training seminars. We will discuss what has worked and not worked with these programs based on feedback from the TAs-in-training and from student feedback once the TAs-in-training became TAs.

It has been shown that students encounter significant reasoning difficulties when interpreting and applying multi-variable expressions in many contexts. For example, students often argue that, since the frequency of a periodic wave is expressed in terms of wavelength and propagation speed, the frequency must change when the speed changes. Similarly, many students think that the capacitance will always change if the potential difference between the capacitor's plates is changed. In this investigation we probed the extent to which students' incorrect reasoning approaches could be altered by making explicit connections during instruction between the treatments of multi-variable expressions in several contexts, such as waves and electrostatics. We also examined students' ability to transfer their understanding between these contexts.

Students' entering mathematical skill level is usually considered one of the best indicators of their success in introductory physics courses. A common expectation is that students who meet the prerequisite requirement will be well-prepared; however, this is rarely the case. In a recent study at the Department of Physics and Astronomy of Eastern Kentucky University, we collected the students' math diagnostic scores both in physics courses and in an algebra course. Our results suggest that when students take physics, their math diagnostic scores improve significantly, even more so than they do in a traditional mathematics course. As we recently changed math prerequisite, the data both before and after the change will be presented. The talk will focus on the link between the course content and mathematical skill improvement. The correlation between math scores and Force Concept Inventory will be discussed.

At the 2011 Summer AAPT Meeting we reported on the accuracy of students' estimation of their exam score. That study, which was completed with second semester calculus-based students, seemed to suggest that students typically overestimated their exam score. We further found that low scoring students tended to have larger overestimates than high scoring students. We report here on a follow-up study completed with a different population of physics students -- future elementary teachers. We asked these students to predict their score before taking the exam and estimate their score after taking the exam. Further, we also asked students to predict and estimate the class mean as well as provide brief explanations of how they arrived at their predictions or estimates in each case. We report on the results of the follow-up study and where relevant compare these with the results of the previous study.

A troubleshooting activity was carried out by an e-tutor in two steps. First the student diagnoses a mistaken statement, then the student compares his diagnosis to an exemplary diagnosis provided by the e-tutor. To examine whether and how the activity attains its objective -- to engage students in a process of clarifying and repairing the mistaken ideas underlying the mistaken statement, we studied the discourse between students working with the e-tutor on a statement implying that because there is no current on an open switch in a DC circuit, according to Ohm's law the potential difference is necessarily zero. We present an analysis showing how the activity triggered students to explicate multiple alternative interpretations of the principles and concepts involved and attempt to align conflicting interpretations. We discuss how successive amendations gradually culminated in the elaboration of students' understanding of these concepts.

Physics Teaching Assistants (TAs) in transformed environments are subject to increased demand to engage with student ideas and support classroom norms that may be very different from those they experienced as learners. Therefore these environments offer a rich opportunity to examine how TAs' beliefs coordinate with their instructional practices in ways that may either support or inhibit the use of research-based instructional strategies. In this talk we describe the importance of a framework for analyzing TAs' beliefs and practices, argue the need for linking these two domains, and present a framework for doing so. Using examples drawn from several semesters of TA interviews and classroom videotape, we then show the utility of this framework and describe instances of coordination and incoordination between TA beliefs and practices.

We used the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) to assess changes in attitude during a general education course aimed at non-science majors. The course is two semesters in duration, and both semesters were surveyed. The survey was administered to a total of 1037 student in 26 different sections over three semesters. With this study, we observe a variety of different attitudinal shifts in different sections, including large increases in favorable responses in some sections. In general one might expect that increases in favorable responses would be accompanied by decreases in unfavorable responses. However, we observe some situations with increases in both favorable and unfavorable responses, and others with decreases in both. We will present an analysis of the attitudinal shifts, and discuss factors, such as instructor and method of instruction, that might contribute to shifts in attitude.

The effects of project-based learning in an algebra-based Physics First course on students' problem-solving abilities are explored. A problem-based exam for introductory physics was developed and used with a previously established problem-solving rubric. The exam was administered to freshmen physics classes at three high schools. One of the schools was using a heavily project-based curriculum, while the other two relied primarily on traditional methods. Strong positive correlations in performance and the project-based curriculum were observed, though continued development of the study is ongoing to separate other factors and see if causality exists. The initial data is being used to help refine the measurement instrument and evaluate the curricular elements.

When drawing and gesturing in physics, spatial dimensions on the writing surface or of the body are used temporarily to stand for physical quantities. Sometimes these quantities are literally spatial (the position of a particle), and sometimes they are more abstract (e.g., velocity, time, electric field, complex amplitude of an energy eigenstate). Sometimes we need more dimensions than are available to communicate a message or think through a problem. When one spatial dimension is used to represent more than one physical quantity, the "multiple-occupancy problem" is created: How do thinkers stay organized, keeping two (or more) separate meanings for one spatial dimension in ways that these meanings can be used productively? We introduce the idea of "nested coordinates" in the spatial communication and cognition of physics as a common way that thinkers deal with the multiple-occupancy problem.

The Physics Education Group at the University of Minnesota has been constructing web-based programs that can provide introductory physics students with coaching in the use of an expert-like framework in solving problems. During the fall 2011 semester, the coaches were introduced into a large (200+ students) section of the introductory mechanics course at the University of Minnesota to assess their educational impact. In this talk, we present the results of using a problem-solving rubric to analyze students' solutions from problems on mid-semester quizzes and the final exam. The rubric evaluates a student's problem-solving performance along five axes based on expert-novice problem solving research. This work was supported by NSF DUE-0715615.

Many educators struggle with student resistance to PER-based "active learning" curricula. We might expect that Tadao, a university student in Tokyo using translated Maryland Open Source Tutorials [1], would exhibit such resistance. His previous physics experiences in high school (focused on university entrance exam preparation) and in college had been very traditional; Tadao reported that he had developed a view of physics as knowledge to memorize and calculations to perform. However, despite this epistemological mismatch, Tadao (and other classmates) quickly adapted to the new style of learning and developed a more sophisticated view of what it means to understand physics. Why wasn't there more resistance? Tadao and a few other students credited elementary school with having provided "constructivist," tutorial-like experiences that made the adjustment easier. An instructional implication for overcoming resistance to PER-based pedagogy is the possibility of utilizing students' "constructivist" experiences, even ones seemingly distant from university physics.

Computer-based practice exams and immediate feedback with worked out solutions can improve the performance on later problems with identical solutions. However, immediate feedback and worked out solutions fall short in helping students transfer the conceptual and procedural knowledge to slightly different problems.* Nevertheless, the students who started using our practice exam at least two days before the exam performed better on the real exam than students who started and completed our practice exam later, especially on the problem types they missed on the practice exam. This suggests that the practice exam can provide formative assessment to students, but the feedback system has to be adjusted. One possible feedback system might be providing students personal tutors and enough time to improve. We did a preliminary clinical study on a series of practice exams with tutors to quantify the possible help from tutors.

We investigated student understanding of simple vector component problems. Students in a calculus-based introductory physics class were given a variety of vector component questions, with the angle placed in various orientations. For example, the angle could be given with respect to vertical/horizontal, or with respect to the tip/tail of the vector. While some angle configurations were almost error-free, on many configurations students often confused sine with cosine and committed sign errors. The types of errors observed were found to depend on the configuration of the given angle. Overall results suggest that many students based their answers on the most commonly seen canonical angle configuration, regardless of which angle was actually given in the problem. This suggests that students need repeated practice on a variety of orientations, so that students do not become tied down to one familiar configuration.

Thermodynamics is a core part of curricula in physics and many engineering fields. Despite the apparent similarity in coverage, individual courses in each discipline have distinct emphases and applications. Physics education researchers have identified student difficulties with concepts such as heat, temperature, and entropy as well as with larger grain-sized ideas such as state variables, path-dependent processes, etc. Engineering education research has corroborated these findings and has identified additional difficulties unique to engineering contexts. We are beginning a project that provides an excellent opportunity for expanding the interdisciplinary research on conceptual understanding in thermodynamics. This project has two goals: first, determine the overlapping content and concepts across the disciplines; second, compare conceptual understanding between these groups using existing conceptual questions from PER and EER. We will present a review of PER and EER literature in thermodynamics and highlight some concepts that we will investigate.

Improving non-cognitive outcomes such as attitudes, efficacy, and persistence in physics courses is an important goal in physics education. This investigation implemented an in-the-moment surveying technique called the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) [1] to measure students' affective experience in physics. Measurements included: self-esteem, cognitive efficiency, activation, intrinsic motivation and affect. Data are presented showing contrasts in students' experiences, (e.g., in physics vs. non-physics courses).

One key aspect of solving physics problems is the ability to interpret and use multiple representations of information (e.g. words, equations, pictures, diagrams, and graphs). In this talk, we describe a study that uses eye-tracking technology to investigate how students view and comprehend physics representations presented on a computer screen. We also discuss the implications of this research for the design of instructional examples and online learning materials.

Student-generated analogies can provide useful insight into students' conceptual understanding. I will describe an activity from a physical science class in which students generated their own analogies to illustrate Newton's laws of motion. Student analogies for Newton's third law indicate that students tend to focus their attention either on the presence of two objects, neglecting their interaction, or on the resulting dynamics of a single object. This result will be illustrated through several student examples. I will also discuss the role of context for students who generated multiple analogies to illustrate multiple concepts.

Asking students about the acceleration of a tossed object is a well-studied problem in physics education research. Students frequently respond using reasoning that describes the velocity of the ball, in particular that acceleration is zero at the top. We created new versions of the canonical multiple-choice Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation ball-toss questions to investigate what other reasoning students might use. Some students were asked "is the acceleration zero at the top?" These students were half as likely to give a velocity-like response (that a=0) as were students answering the canonical form. Other students were told "the acceleration is not zero" and asked to explain. Roughly 75% of these students could explain why acceleration is not zero. This is in contrast to the 60% who say it is zero at the top. We discuss implications for instruction based on these data.

Although there are many talented people developing new ways of teaching undergraduate science more effectively, these innovations are not being used as widely as they should be. We are at the early stages of a larger effort designed to help curriculum developers incorporate propagation strategies from the beginning of their projects. To understand which strategies work best for certain projects, we have spoken with NSF program directors and analyzed responses to a survey of NSF-funded curriculum developers. One finding is that NSF directors have different views from developers about which propagation strategies are most successful. Developers tend to think of dissemination primarily as "getting the word out" by, for example, publishing a paper or giving a conference talk. NSF program directors, however, would like to see more active approaches, such as increasing the number and variety of development collaborators and holding workshops.

A critical goal in science education is to encourage minority students' continued interest and engagement in science [1-2]. Here, we provide a case study of an eighth-grade student from Honduras,"Estevan," who first caught our attention in class for his dogged pursuit of trying to figure out how seasons occur on Earth. We draw on interview and classroom data to demonstrate that what engages Estevan lies at the intersection of epistemology and identity. Specifically, his epistemological stance toward science as figuring things out for oneself taps into his personal love of challenges, and this love of challenges is tied strongly to his sense of self. We make the case for conceptualizing personal epistemology as deeply intertwined with aspects of identity, at least for some students, and we draw the implications of this perspective for classroom practice.

Traditional teaching environments often make it difficult for faculty to achieve their instructional goals and to implement reforms. Oregon State University (OSU) introduced a SCALE-UP inspired studio to facilitate student-centered, interactive learning for students in the calculus-based introductory physics courses. This talk will present the affordances gained by faculty members implementing reforms in the studio environment. We investigated two instructors: an experienced PER member and an experienced faculty member taking on new reforms. They were observed as they taught in both traditional and studio-style classrooms, as well as interviewed throughout the three terms of the calculus-based introductory physics course at OSU. The focus will be on how the studio helps instructors better align their teaching experiences with their philosophies and goals, as well as how it promotes better teaching habits.

The Physics Education Group at the University of Minnesota has been constructing web-based programs that can provide introductory physics students with coaching in the use of an expert-like framework in solving problems. During the fall 2011 semester, the coaches were introduced into a large (200+ students) section of the introductory mechanics course at the University of Minnesota to assess their educational impact. In this talk, we discuss the design of this experiment, including the construction of comparison groups, student reactions to the computer programs, and lessons learned. A companion presentation will discuss the status of the data analysis, including results obtained to date. This work was supported by NSF DUE-0715615.

An important part of physics disciplinary practice is the use of terminology. Scientists need to be able to identify vague or unscientific terms and meanings and refine them into clearly articulated ideas. This work is not done in isolation, but rather, members of the community must come together to decide on mutually agreed upon definitions. But how are words defined and mutual understanding achieved? What skills do physics students already have along these lines and what new skills must be supported? And how does language itself support and constrain this work? This talk will focus on a study of undergraduate physics majors where small groups of three to four students are asked to categorize and define the physical phenomenon of threshold in an open-ended design task. We will present skills we have identified as important to making definitions and discuss ways that language plays an important role in this process.

We present qualitative data of undergraduates describing the relationship between scientific disciplines. Rather than viewing biology, chemistry, and physics as existing in disconnected silos, these students often describe the relationships in a hierarchical or horizontal fashion. The hierarchical arrangements order the disciplines by degree of system complexity, or by the scale used to examine a particular system. For example, a student might view the full description of folded proteins at the top (biology), chemical reactions involving proteins' functions as chemistry, and motion of the protein's individual atoms as foundational (physics). Other students describe a horizontal view of disciplinary boundaries, without a foundational bottom but maintaining overlapping realms of interest. Others want physics embedded in a context that positions its relationship to biology via analogy. We examine evidence that students' conceptions are unstable and context-dependent, and suspect that these conceptions are related to course messaging in a bidirectional manner.

As part of an ongoing study of student learning in upper-division courses in thermal physics and mathematical methods, we have examined students'approaches to homework completion and test preparation. For example, students were asked to complete and submit supplemental information sheets with homework assignments. On the sheets, students reported, among other things, with whom they had worked and what resources they had consulted. The responses suggested very different strategies for completing homework, and vast differences in the level of collaboration. In this talk, we report a preliminary examination of these responses and their relationship to performance on homework and course examinations.

In our previous work we interviewed faculty retrospectively about their decision-making regarding research-based reforms. In order to develop a more in-depth understanding we are currently following 15 physics faculty during the change process. We report on interviews of 15 physics faculty pre- and post-semester for the two semesters they taught an introductory course following their participation in the Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshop. All faculty interviewed were in their beginning years as an instructor and expressed a strong interest in integrating Physics Education Research in their teaching practice. In this talk we present an analysis of the research-based instructional practices these faculty implemented, including the ways in which they modified practices and the reasons behind their decisions to implement and modify.

We are studying how students talk and gesture about physics problems involving directionality. Students discussing physics use more than words and equations; gestures are also a meaningful element of their communication. We are investigating the extent to which modifications to a student's gestures lead to changes in that student's thinking. Data come from one-on-one interviews about the sign and direction of velocity and acceleration within a given coordinate system. Specific contexts are the ball toss without air resistance and the interpretation of a differential equation describing the air resistance of falling objects.

Augsburg College offers a sophomore-level modern physics course with associated lab. We will describe our redesign of this lab to create a semester-long responsive inquiry research experience focused on nanotechnology, materials characterization tools, and biology as an inspiration for engineers. Students gain hands-on experience using scanning electron microscopes, atomic force microscopes, as well as other sample preparation tools, and develop their own research projects using the equipment. A goal of the lab is to give students an experience of what research is like and what a scientist does, in order to improve their self-identity as scientists. The focus on contemporary skill building is intended to meet the changing demographics of our student body (increased enrollment, interest in engineering, and first-generation college students). One goal of our project is to determine if the valuable experiences gained through undergraduate research can be re-enforced, supplemented, or extended to a broader student population through more traditional areas of the curriculum. We assess the impact of labs and undergraduate research experiences on students' understanding of the process of science and what a scientist does, and on their self-identities as scientists. We identify general features of labs, research experiences, and other educational environments that may impact student's self-identities as scientists.

Students' personal epistemology -- their notions about the nature of knowledge and learning -- affect how they approach learning [1]. These personal epistemologies have usually been conceptualized as originating in students' past experiences and recruited in particular learning contexts [2]. Drawing on a case study based on a clinical interview with an electrical engineering major ("Rebecca") in an introductory physics class, we argue that in some instances, students' projected sense of their future profession -- an aspect of their developing disciplinary identities -- influences their approaches towards learning. Specifically, Rebecca positions herself as an electrical engineer and draws a distinction between her introductory mechanics course, which she sees as irrelevant to her future, and courses on digital logic and introductory electromagnetism, which she sees as relevant. She sees mechanics as less coherent than digital logic. She structures her learning in the two courses differently and reflects on how she draws on more rote-learning in physics, but deep sense-making in digital logic design.

When presented with the correct answer to a commonly used PER question and asked to justify it, students have diverse ways of responding. Surprisingly, many students reject the given answer and do not attempt to explain why it is correct. Other students appear to not accept the answer as correct, but still attempt to justify the answer by reinterpreting the problem or applying a strategy to determine the expected reasoning. This range of unexpected responses provides information about students' knowledge, cognitive processes, and epistemologies.We discuss examples of these responses from interviews and pre-tests where students were asked both canonical tasks and tasks where they were given the correct answer. Our results have implications for research, curriculum design, and instruction.

Previous work has shown that students can combine physics equations with conceptual understandings. For example, the "Base + Change symbolic form" [1] can be used to interpret the equation v=v0+at conceptually as "the final value is the base value plus a change." Although the use of symbolic forms has been well documented, these studies have not investigated why a student may use a symbolic form in one problem but may not in different problems [1]. Through clinical interviews with undergraduates in an introductory physics class, we investigate the dynamics of whether and how students engage in symbolic forms-based reasoning. The interviews, focused on quantitative physics problems and epistemological prompts, are coded for (1) symbolic forms use and (2) independent and explicit evidence of certain epistemological stances. We argue that epistemological stances that value coherence between intuitive and formal ideas support the use of symbolic forms-based reasoning.

Following a lecture-driven introduction to DC circuits, students frequently responded to features about resistors when asked to compare the power dissipation between two circuits -- while ignoring relevant features about the voltage or current sources. Over a series of questions, individual students answered in different manners, with some consistently answering in favor of one particular feature (e.g., the circuit with a greater number of resistors will always dissipate more power). Among 150 students, several such responses were identified. In an attempt to mediate these individual differences and align student performance with the intended outcome of instruction, some students completed additional practice problems that were meant to address a particular response, while others received more generic practice with a wide variety of power-comparison questions.

Multiple researchers have reported that active engagement classrooms are associated with higher gains in student performance. However at the individual level, increased student participation doesn't always lead to high course performance. We propose that the classroom as a single community of practice (CoP) does not stand on its own but is interconnected with myriad other CoPs. Students doing physics in communities beyond the classroom contribute to their physics major identity development. For example a student may develop a strong, persistent sense of being a physicist with parents as role models but only participate peripherally in class. To elicit students' perception about being a physicist and participation in relevant CoPs, we collected a series of prompted reflective journals and individual student interviews in an upper-division course in thermodynamics. In this talk, we present several case studies of these students' physics major identity development and the communities in which they practice physics.

In this talk I will describe students' use of their real-world knowledge and their epistemological framing during collaborative group recitation problems in an introductory algebra-based physics course for non-physics majors. Analysis of 14 different student groups working on three different recitation problems reveals that: 1) Despite significant prompting within the problems and support in lecture, over half of the groups do not make significant use of their real-world knowledge as a part of their solution to the recitation problems. 2) Students that do make use of their real-world knowledge do so during conceptual discussion, but not during procedural discussion. Implications for instruction and future research will be discussed.

A recent area of investigation that has developed in the STEM community is students' sense making and answer making activities in collaborative problem-solving learning environments. In these learning environments, sense making manifests as discussions which are aimed at ascertaining "what is going on" in the problem. Conversely, answer making manifests as a discussion that is aimed toward procedures with the intended goal to find out "what to do." Collaborative problem solving environments typically employ TAs to lead the discussion and encourage students to work together to develop an understanding of the concepts being probed in the problems. In this talk, we examine TA interventions which result in tipping students into sense making activities.

We report the results of two studies of the effect of problem format on students' answers. In particular, we studied the ability of students to explain their reasoning and demonstrate the use of a logical problem-solving process based on the physics principles they have learned. We analyzed the structure of both the correct and incorrect answers. The same problem written was written in multiple formats and administered as a quiz in the large introductory physics sections in both the algebra-based and calculus-based classes. The formats included multiple choice only, multiple choice and explain your reasoning, explain your reasoning only, ranking and explaining your reasoning and multiple choice ranking with explain your reasoning, and a few others. We present the results.

Simple phenomena, such as lifting and lowering a ball vertically a few feet, can offer tremendous insight into learner thinking about energy transfers and transformations. The insights gained depend on the data collected. The first and second authors collaborated to compare undergraduates' written responses to questions on energy in lifting/lowering scenarios to secondary teachers' videotaped discussions of similar questions in professional development courses. Our comparison of these data sets is not a controlled study; the representations in the two data sets are different, the populations are different, and in general comparing written work to video is rather like comparing a tropical jungle to a backyard garden. That said, our findings illuminate the different opportunities presented by our two research modalities.

Learning Assistants (LAs) have been shown to have better conceptual understanding and more favorable beliefs about science than non-LAs, and are more likely to choose a career in K-12 science teaching [1]. We propose that connections between elements of identity, persistence, and participation in an LA program can be explained using the concept of the community of practice and its intimate relationship to identity [2]. In separate work, Hazari et al. found that physics identity was highly correlated to expressed career plans in physics [3]. We hypothesize that a thriving LA program has many features of a well-functioning community of practice and contributes to all four elements of physics identity: "personal interest," "student performance," "competence," and "recognition by others." We explore how this analysis of the LA experience might shape decisions and influence outcomes of adoption and adaptations of the LA model.

In light of recommendations from the literature for modeling expert-like problem solving approaches, we investigated instructors' goals for providing example solutions in introductory physics courses. Twenty-four graduate teaching assistants and 30 faculty were asked: 1) in a general context, to describe their main purposes for providing example solutions, and 2) specifically, to identify their considerations when comparing three example solutions that reflect different pedagogical views. Differences between the faculty and TAs will be discussed in order to describe possible progression of ideas throughout an instructor's professional career. For example, faculty explicitly emphasize the importance of developing expert-like problem solving when discussing their goals in the general context. In contrast TAs refer to the goal of developing expert-like problem solving mainly in an implicit manner, when examining specific solutions, and emphasize other values, such as helping students develop conceptual understanding, when asked explicitly on their purposes in the general context.

Endeavoring to find effective teaching pedagogies, inquiry methods have become increasingly popular in PER. Here we review one inquiry method, Project-Based Learning (PBL). The overview includes its foundations, major characteristics, and effectiveness compared to traditional methods. We find that overall PBL is usually better than traditional teaching, but there are conditions that need to be met for implementing a PBL curriculum successfully. This includes both classroom considerations as well as administration issues. If these problems can be successfully navigated, then PBL has good reason to be more widely implemented. This leads to the next stage: building PBL curricula to teach physics. We then discuss a new PBL curriculum using roller coaster projects to teach physics.

Representational fluency is the ability to competently use different representations of the same information, and is an important skill for solving physics problems. We use eye-tracking technology to explore how visual attention is related to representational fluency. We showed introductory and graduate physics students two different representations (graph, equation, or text) and asked them to judge whether the representations are consistent (could describe the same situation). We compare the gaze patterns of students who made correct judgements versus those who made incorrect judgements, and make comparisons across introductory and graduate student groups.

Research has shown that the inclusion of argumentation tasks can improve students' problem solving and reasoning skills. We investigate two forms of scaffolds -- one designed to facilitate construction of an argument and another designed to facilitate evaluation of an argument. We integrated these scaffolds within physics problems, and assessed their impact on the argumentation quality and conceptual quality of students' solutions to these problems. Results suggest that the use of argumentation scaffolds, rather than the mere use of an argumentation task, seemed to improve students' argumentation skills on these problems. We also found that for problems in both verbal and graphical representations, the use of argumentation scaffolds with tasks that required students to evaluate an argument seemed to improve the conceptual quality of students' solutions to these problems.

After learning Newton's second law, students in a university modeling-based introductory physics class are asked to imagine a box sliding across a floor and slowing to a stop. Although they've had extensive experience with friction in the context of energy, this is their first exposure to friction within the context of forces. They are asked to make different representations for this scenario, including a system schema, and force diagram. During their small group work, students quickly run into a difficulty: there are only two interactions with the box (contact, gravitational), so there should only be two forces, yet the box is slowing, which means it must have unbalanced forces in the direction of acceleration. In this talk, I present evidence from the student-lead whole class discussion showing how the class uses the System Schema to help reason about this problem in a productive manner and come to a useful consensus.

A significant consideration in PER is student preconceptions at variance with modern physics, but also worthy of examination is the development of these erroneous notions. The preconceptions come about from the real-world interactions students have had before physics instruction, which lead to complex network intuitive thoughts on how they feel and what they believe. During learning there are complex interactions between these prior beliefs and what students learn in class, which need to be understood if educators are to be successful. We examine a collection of first-term calculus-based physics students using a set of linear motion questions along with interviews and further questions during one-on-one interview sessions. We investigate how students' preconceptions are manifested within the contexts of physical settings and personal feelings. The results shed lights on how such preconceptions are formed through students' experiencing the world and how instruction may be informed to better address such preconceptions.

The ability to learn on one's own could be one of the most valuable skills any student can acquire in school. In physics, students generally expect to be taught, or they don't believe that they can learn without the instructor's help. Due to their lack of confidence in physics, when students are given the opportunity to learn on their own, they often give up without trying. For instructors who are interested in getting students to self-direct their learning, it is important to provide both extra motivation and matching assessment to encourage students to take on the challenge. In this talk, we will show how building a learning community can lower student resistance to instructional reform, at the same time increasing student confidence in their ability to complete difficult tasks. We will also show how we used self-directed-learning assessments to both motivate students as well as to assess their progress.

Energy Theater is an embodied learning activity in which participants act out energy transfers and transformations with their bodies. We have observed that participants in Energy Theater are often surprised by scenarios in which large quantities of energy are transformed from kinetic to thermal. This surprise appears to be a result of an expectation that a quantity of energy should be equally "perceptible" in different forms, an expectation that is violated when easily visible kinetic energy transforms into imperceptible thermal energy. We claim that Energy Theater enforces energy conservation in a way that pushes participants to recognize the presence of forms of energy that they do not expect, and to adjust their models of scenarios to take into account counterintuitive phenomena.

The teaching and learning of electric circuits has been the topic of many investigations over a period of many years. The primary focus has been on simple dc circuits. As part of an ongoing, multi-institutional effort, we are extending the scope of this research by conducting an in-depth investigation of student understanding of analog electronics. Some of this work has been carried out in the context of basic diode circuits, which are covered at both the introductory and upper-division levels. This overlap provides a unique opportunity to examine the difficulties students experience when encountering the same content at different instructional levels. This presentation will highlight selected findings from the introductory course, together with insights into how these results can inform the treatment of related content in upper-division courses.

One of the major goals of teaching physics is to facilitate student learning of the deep principles and concepts, which can later be applied to novel problems. In this study we look at how students assess the importance of principles and concepts for problem solving. Students in an algebra-based physics course were asked to choose two problems from each of their homework assignments which they found to be most similar. The two problems selected were then explicitly compare and contracted in writing. The written statements were then divided by clause topics and further categorized into levels of epistemic reasoning. This presentation is oriented to introduce the audience to the qualitative analysis used and provide some general trends that appear in our homework responses.

Unlike most schools, the lecture and lab portions of the introductory algebra-based physics courses at Shepherd University are not linked. Material covered in the lab portion is not the same between sections nor is it tied to the lecture portion. It is possible to cover material in lecture and not in lab and vice versa. Students can have one instructor for lecture and another for lab. Student performance on in-class exams and the FCI is investigated as a function of the combination of lecture and lab instructors.

There are many hypotheses regarding physics classroom experiences that may encourage female students to pursue careers in the physical sciences. Using Propensity Score Matching (PSM) on national data (n=7505) drawn from the Persistence Research in Science and Engineering (PRiSE) project, we test five commonly held beliefs including having a single-sex physics class, having a female physics teacher, having female scientist guest speakers, discussing the work of women scientists, and discussing the under-representation of women. The effect of these experiences is compared for female students who are matched on several factors, including parental education, prior science/math interests, and academic background, thereby controlling for the effect of many confounding variables.

In statistical mechanics there are two quantities that directly relate to the probability that a system at a temperature fixed by a thermal reservoir has a particular energy. The density of states function is related to the multiplicity of the system and indicates that occupation probability increases with energy. The Boltzmann factor is related to the multiplicity of the reservoir and indicates that occupation probability decreases with energy. This seems contradictory until one remembers that a complete probability distribution is determined by the total multiplicity of the system and its surroundings, requiring the product of these two functions. We present evidence from individual and group interviews that students knew how each of these functions relates to multiplicity but did not recognize the need to combine the two to characterize the physical scenario.

There is growing interest in constructing technology-rich classrooms (eg. SCALE_UP & TEAL) to enable student-centered active learning. But what if technology-rich classrooms are used by instructors who have not fully embraced student-centered pedagogies? We studied the effect of different classrooms (conventional vs technology-rich) and of different pedagogies (active learning vs. traditional) on students' conceptual change. We also examined the effect of the instructors' perception of their instructional approach (teacher-centred and student-centred) on students' conceptual learning. Our findings show that technology-rich classrooms work only when implemented with student-centered pedagogies. Students who received an active learning pedagogy in technology-rich classrooms achieved greatest conceptual gains. However, students exposed to traditional pedagogies achieved similar gains in the technology-rich and conventional classrooms. We also found that instructors range on a continuum of student-centredness and that instructors' self-reported student-centredness correlates strongly with their students' conceptual gains.

Our RELATE group is currently teaching an online course on Newtonian Mechanics (http://relate.mit.edu/physicscourse/). The course develops more expert-like problem solving skills using the MAPS Pedagogy [1], and includes hundreds of assessment questions, many based on results from physics education research.

The course is hosted on the LONCAPA network (http://loncapa.org), and anyone in the network can use our course content in their classes.

We analyze logged data of student interactions with supplemental e-texts in introductory physics courses at Michigan State University via LON-CAPA. The e-text contains standard text and some interactive content such as videos and simulations. Metrics include what fraction of students access the e-text, at what time with respect to academic deadlines, and for how long. Preliminary results show moderate usage peaks for each weekly assignment that decline to near-zero over the early part of the semester, with large constant peaks of activity in the approximately two days prior to all examinations. We find that only a small minority of the students access the majority of the e-text; however we cannot measure reading of an assigned written textbook. We plan to investigate the e-text study habits of successful students at MSU, MIT, and in our free online physics course (http://relate.mit.edu/physicscourse/).

In this contribution to our series of talks about how a student's epistemology (views about what counts as knowledge and learning) can be entangled with his sense of who he is, we discuss how "Michael" approached an apparent paradox he encountered near the beginning of his intermediate-level electromagnetism class. Michael wondered if current is defined as moving charge and the ideal conductor is by definition neutral, how could one calculate the current through it? This question is thornier than it first appears. We will show how Michael's identity as a sense-maker, an identity defined in part by its oppositional relation to many aspects of Michael's engineering program, influences how he approaches this problem, and how his approach reinforces his identity.

Online homework is a natural way to assess what students know, but the questions themselves may not always fit the bill. Items may be flawed, too hard or too easy, or they may measure abilities that are different from the intended ones. Item response models not only measure student abilities independently of which subset of questions they answer, but these models also detect flaws in the questions. We demonstrate how collaborative filtering (used by Netflix to predict which movies you might like) can be used to analyze student response data, motivating and extending a class of item response models. Analysis shows that chemistry homework assigned using LON-CAPA at MSU has two-dimensional skill and discrimination, whereas the Mechanics Baseline Test at MIT is unidimensional.

We use the framework of conceptual and epistemological resources to investigate how students construct understanding of a complex modern physics topic that requires mastery of multiple concepts. We interviewed experts and novices about their understanding of the physics of solar cells, and examined their responses for evidence of resources being activated. We used this information to create a unit discussing the physics of solar cells at the advanced undergraduate level, which we then implemented. Based on the patterns in the interviews and student responses in the classroom during the unit we can hypothesize what ideas students draw on when they are trying to understand the complex physics involved in the functioning of solar cells.

Recent science education reforms have called for teachers to be responsive to the student ideas that arise in the midst of instruction and to make in-the-moment pedagogical decisions that rely on what they hear. There has thus been an increased emphasis on noticing, interpreting, and responding to the disciplinary substance of student ideas in K-12 teacher professional development. However, the physics education research community has yet to develop a systematic way of assessing growth in teacher responsiveness as manifested in their classroom practices. The Energy Project is developing a framework for assessing teacher responsiveness that is grounded in the literature and in episodes from practicing teachers' classrooms. A brief overview of the developing framework will be presented.

It is common practice when researching student understanding of introductory DC circuits to assume that using the brightness of a light bulb as a proxy for current leads to results that can be generalized. While this conclusion may indeed be consistent with a classic "misconceptions" view, it is not clear that this is true from a "knowledge in pieces" perspective in which context and cognitive "grain-size" are key components. We report on a study with first-year physics students in which we made contextual changes to an "open circuit" in order to measure the effect of such changes to student responses. The eight-question instrument that we designed included representational, linguistic, and (circuit) elemental variations. Our findings indicate that while the changes might appear trivial to an expert they significantly affect the way in which students respond.

A 10-year study of how students use their out-of-class time in an introductory physics class is presented. The study is used to evaluate the extent to which a student's performance on hourly exams or on conceptual inventories is predictable by his or her study habits. The correlation of good study habits with good performance is evaluated. The study tracks student behavior through a major curricular revision to determine the extent to which student habits react to changes in a physics class. The study also investigates the role of technical changes such as the introduction of an online homework system and a web-based testing tool on time use.

While epistemology can go some way toward understanding student performance, it has become clear that a number of other factors including broader socio-cultural and systemic issues play critical roles. Using Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) as a theoretical framework we investigated various such aspects including systemic contradictions that lead to student under-performance. We present findings from studies involving small groups of postgraduate students who transferred from "Historically Black Universities" to the National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme that is run at the University of Cape Town

A scientific understanding of energy includes (1) differentiating energy from matter, including recognizing that energy dynamics do not uniformly align with matter dynamics, and (2) coordinating theorized energy dynamics with observational evidence of energy changes in physical systems. We describe a learning activity called Energy Theater that is designed to promote a strong conceptual understanding of energy, including energy conservation, localization in objects, transfer between objects, and transformation among forms. We provide evidence that Energy Theater engages learners with deep conceptual issues in the learning of energy, including disambiguating matter flow from energy flow and theorizing mechanisms for energy transformation. We attribute the effectiveness of this learning activity partly to the special cognitive and interactional affordances of embodied learning activities, in which human bodies represent physical entities in a phenomenon.

Entropy is typically not a central focus either in introductory university physics textbooks or in national standards for secondary education. However, entropy is a key part of a strong conceptual model of energy, especially for connecting energy conservation to energy degradation and the irreversibility of processes. We are developing a conceptual model of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics as they relate to energy, with the goal of creating models and representations that link energy and entropy in a meaningful way for learners analyzing real-life energy scenarios. We expect this model to help learners better understand how their everyday experiences relate to formal physics analyses. Our goal is to develop tools for use with elementary and secondary teachers and secondary and university students.

Drawing appropriate diagrams is a useful problem-solving heuristic that can transform a given problem into a representation that is easier to exploit for solving it. A major focus while helping introductory physics students learn problem solving is to help them appreciate that drawing diagrams facilitates problem solution. We conducted an investigation in which 111 students in an algebra-based introductory physics course were subjected to two different interventions during recitation quizzes throughout the semester. They were either (1) asked to solve problems in which the diagrams were drawn for them or (2) explicitly told to draw a diagram. A comparison group was not given any instruction regarding diagrams. We developed a rubric to score the problem-solving performance of students in different intervention Groups. We present results for two problems involving electric field and electric force. We also compare the performance of students in finding electric field to finding electric force in similar situations both immediately after instruction in a quiz and a while after instruction in a midterm exam.

The Radioactivity By Inquiry project (NSF DUE grant 0942699) is developing inquiry-based materials for teaching radiation literacy at the high school and college levels. Research by others -- Eijkelhof, Millar & Gill, and Prather & Harrington -- found that students initially do not distinguish between radiation and the radioactive source. The undifferentiated view is that radiation is "bad stuff," that there is no difference between radiation and radioactivity, and that radiation causes contamination. To understand radiation, students must distinguish between radiation and radioactive materials and view radiation as more of a process than a material. This talk will describe our efforts to identify and characterize students' initial ideas about radiation in terms of the undifferentiated radiation view and quantify student progress towards differentiation. We find that differentiating fully and abandoning the view of "radiation as stuff" involves a long and challenging process that some students find difficult to complete.

The development of research-based active-learning instructional methods in physics can serve as a model for creation of evidence-based instructional practices in all science fields. Based on a recent review [1], we define these methods as those (1) explicitly based on research in the learning and teaching of physics, (2) that incorporate classroom and/or laboratory activities that require students to express their thinking through speaking, writing, or other actions that go beyond listening and the copying of notes, or execution of prescribed procedures, and (3) that have been tested repeatedly in actual classroom settings and have yielded objective evidence of improved student learning. We describe some key features common to methods in current use. These features focus on (a) recognizing and addressing students' physics ideas, and (b) guiding students to solve problems in realistic physical settings, in novel and diverse contexts, and to justify or explain the reasoning they have used.

The Misconceptions framework for describing students' intuitive knowledge [1] has been criticized on multiple grounds [2], but it has one clear advantage: it connects closely to an instructional strategy of eliciting, unsettling, and displacing students' incorrect ideas [3]. The Resources (Knowledge-in-Pieces) framework [4], by contrast, connects to vague instructional suggestions such as "help students refine and restructure their intuitive ideas," which provides limited help to tutorial writers, other curriculum developers, and instructors. In this talk, I will present what I hope to be a clear, generative strategy for curriculum writers and instructors, a strategy that corresponds to one particular cognitive mechanism of conceptual change within the Resources framework. I illustrate this instructional strategy with examples from tutorials that have contributed to documented conceptual gains.

The Winter Break Effect is a shift in student attitudes toward more expert-like during the break between the first semester and second semester of a course. We have CLASS data from a two semester general education course that seems to demonstrate a Winter Break Effect. However, more detailed analysis of matched responses between the end of the first semester and the beginning of the second semester indicates that no significant shift in overall favorable percentage occurred between the first and second semester. We do however observe a statistically significant decrease in the overall unfavorable percentage. This shift persists throughout the second semester of the course.

Physicists use infinitesimals (dx, dV, dM) in a variety of ways. In first-semester introductory physics, the "d" can refer to at least two types of infinitesimals: first, a change in a physical quantity over time or space; second, a small quantity associated with a small amount of space. Students who receive instruction about only one type of "d" will still be unfamiliar with other types. We develop the change vs. amount distinction by providing examples of student representations for both types. Students may use diagrammatic, graphical, and symbolic representations differently to depict changes vs. amounts. Diagrams that portray changes show time, space, and matter differently than diagrams that portray amounts. We conclude by suggesting that calculus-based physics courses should either explicitly distinguish the different types or attempt to eliminate all references to amounts.

An important skill for proficient problem solving is the fluent use of multiple representations of information (e.g. text, equations, pictures, diagrams, and graphs). In this study, introductory physics students and graduate students viewed several kinematics graphs on a computer screen and were asked to match a region of the graph with a text description of motion. The graphs were carefully designed to elicit common student difficulties with graph interpretation. We compare subjects' performance on the items, their reasoning criteria, and eye movements recorded using an eye tracker.

The electric field and the superposition principle play key roles in the understanding of physical phenomena in Electricity and Magnetism. A very common representation of the electric field is with electric field lines. We conducted an experiment with the objectives of identifying the effect that electric field lines have over the superposition principle, and analyzing the different diagrams that students use to represent the electric field. The experiment consisted in the administration of three versions of a test with open-ended questions about the electric field on a particular case. The tests were administered in a private Mexican university in the spring semester 2012 to 288 students taking the course of Electricity and Magnetism upon completion of the topic of Electrostatics. Students presented only one version in a random way to be able to compare results. Results showed evidence that electric field lines have a negative effect on some students' comprehension of the superposition principle, that many students do not have a coherent framework when arguing the superposition principle using electric field lines, and that students who used vector representation instead of electric field lines representation have a higher tendency toward applying correctly the superposition principle.

The effects of autonomous choices on the student experience in a large-enrollment undergraduate introductory physics course were investigated from a self-determination theory perspective. A controlled study tested how restructuring the course to allow more autonomous choices by the students changed certain aspects of the student experience. This was done by comparing two sets of classes, one in which students were given significantly more opportunities for autonomous choice than the other. It was found that more autonomous choices led to large differences between women and men in interest/enjoyment in learning physics, with women becoming less interested than men. Additionally, only in the set of classes with more autonomous choices did the change over time in students' reasons for taking physics correlate with performance, where coming to study physics more because they wanted to (less because they had to) correlated with higher performance.

Specific expertise in a topic of physics is inevitably influenced by the general enterprise of physics. Using the theoretical framework of Communities of Practice and more specifically the concept of boundaries between local communities and the larger enterprise, we show how changes in paradigms of the larger biophysics field influence a physics research group and the individual expert identities constructed. Data were collected from an ethnographic case study of a biophysics research group weekly research meeting. Focusing on boundary interactions between the biophysics research group and visiting experts from other communities that share a common analytical software, we show how such exchange across community boundaries influence a shift in research of the group and of its individual members as well.

This is an investigation of the consistencies, or lack thereof, in how students apply their knowledge about Newtonian forces after instruction. Students were asked to draw all the forces on both an accelerating car and on a passenger riding in that car. Then they were asked to identify why the car accelerated. They sometimes invent forces, or labeled things as forces that are not actually forces (i.e. "motion", "momentum", "inertia"), giving up on the idea of real forces so that they could make Newton's Second Law work. In addition, students were given the Force Concept Inventory.* I will see how student performance on the Force Concept Inventory, particularly the items about the nature of forces and about Newton's second law, relates to their performance on the car and passenger problem.

A quantum wave function for a particle in a one-dimensional potential may be purely real at some instant, or there may be no such instant, depending on the potential. When the time dependence of the wave function is factored in, any function will surely have both real and imaginary parts. The complex nature of the wave function in these cases is perhaps best shown using three dimensions rather than with a two-dimensional drawing. We asked upper-division quantum mechanics students in an oral exam to show with their hands what the shape of wave functions for various potentials would look like, and how these functions would evolve in time. We analyze the students' gestures to understand their thinking; in particular, we investigate the difference between gestures that trace static structures and those that represent dynamic evolution, and how students extend mathematical knowledge from two-dimensional contexts into three.

Quantum mechanics requires a conceptual framework substantially different from the classical picture students develop in introductory physics courses. We are examining student thinking on several foundational topics in quantum mechanics, including black-body radiation, wave-particle duality, and the Stern-Gerlach effect. Excerpts from interviews, pre-tests, and post-tests will be used to illustrate some of the conceptual and reasoning difficulties we have identified among both introductory and upper-division students.

Large lecture courses and grading time constraints force many instructors to use multiple-choice exams, and many students will encounter multiple-choice exams determining entrance into post-secondary education or career paths. However, research shows that student test preparation does not occur at a deep knowledge level for multiple-choice tests compared to hand-graded exams using worked out problems. Most instructors prefer worked out problems on exams for pedagogical reasons even if it is practically not possible. To increase the efficacy of multiple-choice problems in assessing actual problem-solving skills, I compare the two types of questions on the same test to determine what features of the problem solving skill set best predict overall problem solving capabilities.

The growth of tutorial- and discussion-style recitation sections has made group work an integral part of many physics classrooms. Goals for group work often include increasing student agency and encouraging students to ask their own questions. Once asked, these questions can either be taken up or be disregarded by the group as a whole. What factors influence this decision? We analyze an interaction between three teachers in the Energy Project at Seattle Pacific University in which the question of what makes a material magnetic is first disregarded and then later taken up for an extended discussion. We examine the teachers' framing of their activity to help understand when and why this question is taken up by the group.

Electromagnetic (EM) plane waves are arguably one of the most difficult and abstract ideas taught in an introductory physics course. Instruction on this topic typically involves the use of both three-dimensional diagrams (shown in two dimensions) and mathematical representations. Both of these representations rely heavily on the ability of students to visualize electric and magnetic fields in space and to visualize how they change over time. This presentation will focus on an investigation of an EM plane wave in free space that was used in conjunction with Tutorials in Introductory Physics(1) at the University of Washington. 1 Tutorials in Introductory Physics, 2002, 1st Edition (Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ. *This work has been supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DUE-0733276.

For over 20 years, David Hestenes' diagnostic, the Force Concept Inventory (FCI), has been used in college physics courses to gauge student understanding of Newtonian concepts. This multiple-choice test was developed to aid in designing courses that help students overcome erroneous beliefs. While the FCI has proven invaluable for this purpose, courses oftentimes cover topics that go beyond the scope of the test. In order to broaden coverage, items addressing energy, momentum and rotational dynamics have been created to fit seamlessly with the FCI. This study reveals the development of these questions, starting with administering open-ended questions to reveal misconceptions, which were then analyzed to produce optimal multiple-choice items. Item Response Theory (IRT) was used as an aid in developing the questions and distractors, as well as to determine item difficulty with respect to existing FCI items.

Energy is ultimately unified, but manifests in a variety of ways. Most national and state standards, textbooks, and other instructional materials emphasize forms of energy as an important tool for categorizing the manifestations of energy. However, the new Framework for K-12 Science Education, the basis for the Next Generation Science Standards, cautions against talking about forms of energy as "misleading." This caution aligns with recommendations from some science educators, who support the use of "energy carriers" as an alternative to energy forms. We discuss the distinctions between the multiplicity of alternatives to energy forms, and the advantages and disadvantages of these different methods of categorizing energy. Depending on how we teach them, students may use any of these categorizations of energy as meaningless and superficial lists to be memorized, or as important tools for making sense of the properties of systems and the mechanisms by which these properties change.

The Longitudinal Standing Wave (LSW) Tutorial is a PER-based curriculum that helps students to develop their understanding of sound waves using marked springs, tuning forks, pipes, and plenty of discussion. Though originally designed for the two-semester introductory college physics class, I have recently used this tutorial as a laboratory exercise in a general education Physics of Music class. The group discussions in these two classes of students have interesting similarities and differences. Some of these are a result of students' prior knowledge about sound, while others are affected by the course material covered prior to the tutorial. Observations from my Physics of Music class and comparisons to a standard introductory physics class will be presented. Some subtle apparatus issues will also be addressed.

Many instructional physics practices, such as some traditional lecture demonstrations, provide students with an outcome and ask them to think of reasons that outcome occurred. Other practices, such as Interactive Learning Demonstrations[1] ask students to predict and explain what outcome will occur before demonstrating the outcome. We have been investigating the impact of providing students with the outcome, rather than asking them what they think will happen, on the reasoning students use to explain what will occur. We administered written questions to introductory calculus-based students via an online pretest system. We find that providing students with the outcome often causes them to express different reasoning than students who are asked to select which outcome they think will occur. We also find that the different reasoning elicited by providing students with the outcome can be productive reasoning (e.g. reasoning based on definition), or unproductive reasoning(e.g. compensation reasoning[2]).

Undergraduate educational settings often struggle to provide students with authentic biologically or medically relevant situations and problems that simultaneously improve their understanding of physics. Through exercises and laboratory activities developed in an elective Physics in Biomedicine course for upper-level biology or pre-health majors at Portland State University we aim to teach fundamental physical concepts such as light absorption and emission, and atomic energy levels through analysis of biological systems and medical devices. We report on the effect engaging students in tasks with real medical applications has had on their conceptual understanding of light and spectroscopy through analysis of their responses to open-ended questions. The nature of the activities gives students opportunities to use the medical apparatus and unpack the underlying physical concepts. Additionally, we use the Colorado Learning Attitudes toward Science Survey to determine the extent to which student attitudes toward learning science are changing through the course.

Recent studies have shown that reflection upon physics problem solving remains a difficult task for physics majors to learn how to do properly. The PER community has recently begun an intense effort to address reform in introductory physics courses for the life sciences. Given that the majors frequently chosen by students in this course involve a different domain of content knowledge, it is of interest to probe ability to reflect on problem solving for these students. Plans for a study, based upon recent research on self-diagnosis exercises with calculus-based physics students (1), will be discussed for a second-semester algebra-based physics course, for which the student population consists of mainly life science majors and also computer science majors.

Physics teachers do more than help students understand and apply physics concepts -- they also show students what it means to be a physicist in a community. As recognized members of the academic and disciplinary communities, teachers and other mentors can be in positions to help students understand the communities they are joining by pursuing their major. The choice of practices established in the classroom, the language used to discuss physics, and attitudes about other sciences serve both to inform students about the communities they are joining and also shape the role they might play. We report a case study of a thermal physics course as a community where ideas about what it means to join the physics community as a physicist are supported throughout the instruction interactions. We will showcase how students interpret the subtle and sometimes unintentional cues from the instructor to shape their ideas about becoming a physicist.

The scientific reasoning skills and mathematical ability of ninth-grade students taking a freshman biology and a freshman physics classes were compared. The biology class was inquiry oriented and used the BSCS curriculum. The physics class was taught using the Modeling Instruction pedagogy and did not use a textbook. The scientific reasoning skills were assessed using Lawson's Classroom Test for Scientific Reasoning while the mathematical abilities were assessed using a test designed for the project. The Modeling Instruction physics students outperformed the BSCS students at a satistically significant level.

Even interactive classrooms sometimes give short shrift to the importance of reasoning in conceptual change. We often assume our students are high-level reasoners and teach accordingly, when research shows many of our students are not post- or even formal-operational.

Using the published Lawson test I pre- and post-tested students to determine if they improved their thinking skills. This was done both at a private high school and at a two-year college. All classes were taught using PER methods, primarily Modeling. ILDs and some other PER materials were also used. Some very small gain was sometimes seen in high school, but not reliably. Using some of the ideas of Shayer and Adey in 2YC courses produced improved results. Students first have to be convinced that they can improve their thinking. Then the various thinking skills need to be brought out explicitly. The thinking skills also should be separated from just the physics thinking. In other words there needs to be explicit bridging. Beyond the increase in general thinking skills, physics gain was observed to be in the IE range, but is limited by the achieved thinking skills among other factors.

While the success of the studio mode of instruction in calculus-based physics courses is now well demonstrated, the same cannot be said for algebra-based courses. Keeping this in mind, a study has been conducted on algebra-based electricity and magnetism courses in which studio and lecture sections were taught by the same instructor, using the same text book. Students understanding of the magnetic forces has been assessed using common quiz questions. This presentation will highlight students performance when the problem is asked in a condensed versus divided form. In an effort to assess the relative effectiveness of the two modes of instruction, results of the Survey of Electricity, Magnetism, Circuits and Optics (SEMCO) will also be presented.

Four large sections of intro-physics for physical scientists are compared. One section (treatment) was organized so that students worked to learn the classical ideas connecting forces and motion over the first six weeks of the 10-week quarter and then used the final four weeks to apply those principles to algebraically complicated physical problems. The other three (control) sections learned ideas at essentially the same time as calculations. The treatment group and one of the control sections were taught by the same instructor, had identical curricular materials, and this instructor was blind to the comparison measure, the final exam. After controlling for GPA as well as for incoming conceptual understanding, the treatment group was found to perform significantly better on the final exam than the control group taught by the same instructor and, by a similar measure, the treatment group performed significantly better than any other section.

Worked example research often measures effectiveness by assessing student understanding through a near transfer problem. Failure has been attributed to many things, among them student overconfidence in understanding a given worked example. This experiment directly measured this overconfidence by assessing students with a "zero transfer" task. In this experiment, students were shown a worked example to a homework problem, and then asked later on to reproduce the worked example. Results, including student performance and confidence ratings, will be shown.

It has been shown that practicing on exam-liked problems and getting worked out solutions through an online system can improve students' performance on similar problems both on similar practice problems, as well as on the actual exam. However, the improvements were restricted to problems closely related to the practice problems. In an effort to increase the effectiveness, we performed a clinical study that included two additional treatments, providing targeted homework activities, and one-on-one tutoring. Results of this study and its implications for helping students prepare for the exam will be presented.

We describe the first investigation of student-generated assessment content using the PeerWise online system in an introductory physics course composed exclusively of non-majors. Implemented across three concurrent sections of the course (N=700), we have utilized the same scaffolding and instructional design implementation to that which had previously yielded a very high standard of question quality. This is, therefore, a replication study in a very different course context: the final, and for many, only physics course these students will take. We report details of the students' engagement with the online system, together with an investigation of the quality of the questions that students author, by categorizing them into the levels in the cognitive domain of Bloom's taxonomy. Through sampling of questions authored at distinct points in the course, we are able to track changes in the quality of submissions as the course progresses.

We have implemented a component of student-generated assessment in an introductory physics course comprising exclusively non-majors, using the PeerWise online system. This poster presents details of how we have extended the previous instructional designs for PeerWise, shown to be capable of yielding high-quality questions authored by students, via modification of the six tutorials held throughout the course. A significant fraction of the tutorial content is composed of either studen- generated questions as problems to work through and/or explicit guidance designed to enhance the quality of student contributions. We present details of the change in quality of student-authored questions and explanations over time, mapping the former onto Bloom's Taxonomy and the latter onto a five-point scale.

Over the past 20 years, microcomputer based laboratories (MBLs) have become a common part of introductory physics courses, either in a formal laboratory setting or as part of the flipped classroom model. While student learning gains have been shown in the classroom context, little work has been done to explore the role and effectiveness of MBL technology for physics instruction outside of the classroom. In this talk we present research in which students used a brief, software-guided lesson with an Interactive Online Laboratory (IOLab) system developed at UIUC to review one-dimensional kinematics. The lesson and hands-on activities were designed to address student graphing skills and common conceptual difficulties that persisted after students received classroom instruction on the topic. This group was compared to an equivalent group that read a textbook excerpt addressing the same issues. Results of this study and implications for future work will be presented.

We present results from the first year of ongoing research to better understand how writing an undergraduate thesis improves critical thinking and writing skills through impacting metacognition, motivation, and beliefs. In previous work, we have demonstrated that students studying biology who participate in a thesis-writing course alongside independent research not only develop better writing skills "expected, perhaps" but also exhibit stronger scientific reasoning skills than students working one-on-one with faculty. Students enrolled in the writing course achieved highest honors at graduation at almost triple the rate of other thesis writers. These results are in keeping with the notion that writing can be an effective strategy for promoting positive learning outcomes, but here we strive to understand how writing actually affects learning. Data have been collected across multiple departments and institutions. Ultimately, our analysis will be used to motivate institution- and department-specific changes during subsequent years of this multi-year study.

In the fall of 2010 I was asked to put together a report on the developmental history of the field of Physics Education Research which I presented to the National Research Council of the National Academies of Sciences, Committee on the Status, Contributions, and Future Directions of Disciplined-Based Education Research (DBER). A goal of the committee (with funding from the NSF) was to gain a broad view of the historical development, current status, and future directions of the various DBER fields. The history that I compiled and reported is information I gathered from more than 20 people who are, or were, active in the development of the PER community. In this talk I will summarize this work and compare the development of PER with other DBER fields. Unique developmental aspects of PER that I believe have been crucial in the relative success of the field will be highlighted.

An online homework system is a common practice in introductory physics courses -- mainly at institutions where class sizes are large. It greatly reduces the difficult task of grading. It also provides an immediate feedback to the students. There has been a great discussion in the literature about the effectiveness of these systems, however not so much about the student's perception. Therefore, we investigated this issue by adopting an online homework system in an introductory physics course and conducting surveys to examine the students' opinion about the experience.

In a previous study, I allowed introductory physics students to create a notecard for their midterm and final exams in an attempt to remove equation memorizing as a focus of the course. I hoped to use the study of these cards as an epistemological lens that would uncover their perceptions and attitudes about the course. Without follow-up questions, though, epistemology remained unclear. I have continued the study by adding anonymous survey questions that probe why students chose to include what they did, how (if at all) the card was helpful, and how their card preparation changed throughout the semester.

The PER community has developed materials that build on students' conceptual and epistemological resources. However, little attention has been given to students' technological resources, which are becoming increasingly important. As "digital natives" make up the majority of our student population, a simple change of replacing paper and pencil lab notebooks with digital notebooks may have a dramatic impact on the extent to which students feel valued and respected. Additionally, digital notebooks are more aligned with the way digital natives have learned to do their work. Initial results suggest that digital lab notebooks lead to increased student achievement, engagement, and quality of work. Survey results revealed that students preferred digital notebooks because they allow for "easier data sharing" and increased "versatility." These results will be discussed along with implications for instruction and further research.

Computer-based training on dot products and cross products was given to N=223 students in an introductory level, calculus-based electromagnetism course at The Ohio State University. The level of feedback in training was varied as follows: no training (control), correctness feedback, correctness and correct answer feedback, correctness and explanation feedback. Training lasted for approximately 10 minutes, and a paper assessment was given immediately afterwards. This assessment consisted of both arrow format questions, similar to those in the training, and conceptual/transfer questions related to vector products selected from the Vector Concept Test (Zavala & Barniol). All training conditions significantly outperformed control on both question types (d > 0.46). Consistent with VanLehn's interaction plateau hypothesis, high-level feedback was significantly more effective than low-level feedback for arrow notation questions (d = 0.35) and no significant difference was observed between the high-level feedback conditions for either question type.

Student reasoning difficulties with applying and interpreting multi-variable expressions have been reported previously. In the context of a math course, for example, it may be appropriate to reason that, for the given relationship y = x/a, if x increases, y must also increase; in such cases, it is commonly assumed that variables (e.g., x and y) and constants (e.g., positive a) have been clearly established. However, a direct mapping of the same reasoning in the context of physics (namely, for the given relationship f= v/lamda, if the propagation speed v increases, frequency f must also increase) leads to an erroneous conclusion. In this investigation we are probing the impact of targeted instruction on student ability to apply multi-variable expressions and to transfer their knowledge and skills between different contexts. Data from introductory calculus-based physics courses will be presented and discussed.

For this project we used the advanced placement (AP) grading system to evaluate university student responses for an AP Physics problem on a common final exam given to six separate introductory course sections. The sections were grouped into Inquiry based (IQB), lecture/lab/recitation (LLR), and lecture/lab (LL) course formats. Via the AP grading rubric, we found that each of the course types scored statistically differently with IQB highest, lecture/lab second, and lecture/lab/recitation third. To extend the interpretation of these differences, student work was subjected to a secondary analysis using the framework of epistemic forms and epistemic games [1]. In this secondary analysis, we interpret written student responses as evidence of student moves in six types of knowledge-constructing games. We code differences between student problem solutions to identify different epistemic games being played. These data are interpreted in conjunction with scores on the AP problem to identify trends by course format.

An upper-division laboratory course on analog electronics is a required component of many undergraduate physics programs and often serves as a gateway to other advanced laboratory courses and undergraduate research experiences. Ongoing research in such upper-division electronics courses has revealed persistent student difficulties with foundational circuits concepts (e.g., Kirchhoff's junction rule) as well as canonical topics in analog electronics (e.g., op-amp circuits). We have recently extended our investigation to examine student understanding of fundamental bipolar-junction transistor circuits. Specific examples will be used to highlight our findings and to provide insight into student reasoning about such circuits. In addition, implications for instruction will be discussed.

Even after targeted instruction, many students still struggle to productively and consistently analyze unfamiliar situations. We have been designing sequences of questions that allow for an in-depth examination of inconsistencies in student reasoning approaches. Our results indicate that even those students who do possess the knowledge and skills necessary to analyze many challenging situations correctly often fail to utilize relevant ideas and skills productively; students tend to "abandon" their correct formal reasoning approaches in favor of more intuitive solutions (perhaps more appealing to them at that moment). We will present results from sequences of questions administered in introductory calculus-based physics courses.

Students often fail to draw valid conclusions from simple tables of experimental data. Our research suggests that part of their struggle might be caused by the influence of prior beliefs. In this study, students were asked to either verify or construct a claim about a causal relationship between several variables based on information presented in data tables. We found that students demonstrated belief bias in the ways they chose to cite data, frequently treating their own theories as a source of evidence to be supplemented by or illustrated with examples from data. Because of this tendency to hunt piecemeal through the tables for supporting examples, contradictory data was often simply overlooked. However, even when noticed, data that contradicted their theories was often ignored, misinterpreted to conform, or discounted in some way.

It has been demonstrated in a number of everyday contexts that when reasoning about causes of simple phenomena, people tend to only consider explanations that are the most available in their memory. Thus, even if people know that two factors can influence an outcome, they often only consider the one that is most available. We demonstrate this phenomenon in the physics education context. Specifically, when students are asked to determine explanations for the variation of some quantity, such as the tipping of a balance scale, or the mass density of a material, they tend to only consider the most available variable that causes the variation, even in cases when that variable is physically non-causal. However, when interviewed further, students are often able to reason about alternative explanations and other potential variables. We discuss a range of known student difficulties in physics in terms of this reasoning bias phenomenon.

This study reports on the utility of using various disciplines as vehicles to deliver concepts within physics classes. Specifically we explore the degree to which students' transfer concepts from physics into various disciplinary contexts such as anatomy/physiology, chemistry, mathematics, and public health. The research design includes three phases of learning activities: concept learning, context introduction, and transfer of physics learning task incorporated into multidisciplinary integrated learning modules. Qualitative and quantitative data will be presented to describe the impacts of the various strategies employed at one or more stages of the learning activities used. We report on the impact of altering the level of concreteness of activities at concept learning stage and real world vs abstract example in the context stage on student transfer of physics learning. We also discuss our finding that the extent to which students use or transfer physics concepts varies with disciplinary contexts.

In a supplementary class that aims to help struggling students with problem solving, I have replaced some of the problem practice with basic skill practice, instead. Most of the students are potentially high risk to fail our introductory mechanics class, as flagged by a diagnostic test given to incoming freshmen. They have completed a preparatory class prior to this course, and take this extra class concurrently with mechanics. It is usually focused on problem-solving strategies and lots of practice solving problems. This time, I am treating half of the sections traditionally, while the other half spend some of their time working "easier" problems: old exam problems that most students did really well on, but failing students did poorly on. This work includes a short quiz and a packet of related problems. I will discuss how this affected their performance in their mechanics course.

Beginning in fall 2012, the Cal Poly physics department replaced a short, generic, in-class course evaluation with an online, multi-question survey designed specifically for introductory physics classes. Questions are focused on specific aspects of instruction and on what the student thinks he or she gained from the course rather than on the instructor's popularity. Lecture sections and lab sections have different surveys, each with questions appropriate to that mode of instruction. Student responses to each question are guided by a rubric, so instructors receive highly specific feedback as to what's working and which aspects of instruction need improvement. In addition, the aggregate data, with instructor names removed, has provided new insight into how well the department is meeting its teaching obligations. A variety of interesting results will be presented.

The story from participation in what we now call Physics Education Research (PER) reveals challenges faced by the field since its beginnings in the late 1960s, early 1970s. PER is not from a bifurcation of an existing field of physics. Instead, it is a brand new field in physics. As such, PER has faced, and still faces, challenges of a different sort than one would expect in a bifurcation. Some of these challenges will be described from the perspective of a member of the field since near its beginning.

We examined the effects of various kinds of training tasks on student responses to questions about the relationship between the directions of net force and velocity, and between acceleration and velocity in one dimension. The four training conditions were constructed in a 2x2 design (abstract vs. concrete contexts) x (acceleration-velocity vs. force-velocity question types), and a control (no training) was also included. We found that all training conditions significantly improved performance on all question types compared to control, however acceleration-velocity training resulted in higher performance on all question types compared to force-velocity training. Additionally we found that the degree of abstraction of the training (that is, the number of concrete details included in the example) has no significant effects on student scores. These results are consistent with hierarchies of student understanding of force and motion in previous works, which we also discuss.

For instructors, it is distressing to see students who spend a considerable amount of time and effort learning physics still end up performing poorly on exams. At university of Illinois, we observe in our introductory physics courses that a substantial fraction of students who receive failing grades actually completed over 80% of all course-related activities. In order to improve the exam performance for those students, we initiated a three-year project aiming at better understanding the causes of their poor exam performance, and developing a computer-based online tool to better guide those students through the process of preparing for an exam. One year into the project, we have identified a number of possible causes leading to the poor exam performance of those hard-working students, including inaccurate self-estimation, lack of basic knowledge/skills, and insufficient ability to learn from worked out solutions. In this talk, we will also demonstrate how we designed our exam-preparation tool to help students address these issues.

Multiple representations are important for learning physics concepts and solving problems (e.g. interpreting text, equations, pictures, diagrams, and/or graphs), yet students often struggle to make sense of these representations. This study investigates how introductory students and graduate students view and interpret motion graphs. Participants viewed several graphs of position, velocity, or acceleration on a computer screen and were asked to match a region of the graph with a description of the object's motion. We compare performance on the questions with audio-recorded explanations and eye movements recorded using an eye tracker.

As students develop their physics identity, their ability to successfully understand the relationship between mathematics and physics plays an integral role. What are their expectations about how mathematics should be done in physics classes? How do they understand typical idiomatic expressions such as "far away" or "blows up"? In this talk, these questions will be discussed using observational video-based data of upper-division physics students using micro-genetic analysis of discourse. Starting with how students become aware of mathematical idioms and use them in problem solving and sense-making, this analysis will give insight into how students understand mathematics in physics using mathematical idioms as a lens.

Research has demonstrated that using visual cues to focus students' attention on relevant areas in diagrams and animations can increase comprehension and facilitate problem solving. In this study we investigate the effectiveness of visual cues and correctness feedback in conceptual physics problems containing a diagram with respect to comprehension and transfer of physics concepts. Students enrolled in an introductory physics course were individually interviewed. During each interview students worked through sets of problems containing a diagram. Each problem set contained an initial problem, six isomorphic training problems, and a transfer problem. Answers and explanations were given verbally. Students in the cued conditions saw visual cues on the training problems, and those in the feedback conditions were told if their responses were correct or incorrect. We discuss the influence of both cueing and feedback on students' answers and attention.

Human brain mapping methods offer the opportunity to provide biological evidence of student engagement in physics conceptual reasoning and problem solving tasks. We identified brain networks associated with physics problem solving via a quantitative meta-analysis of component cognitive processes such as deductive reasoning, spatial skills, and mathematical calculations. This study assembled functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the BrainMap database [1] and used computational data mining techniques to identify the neural correlates associated with these cognitive processes. The present results were designed to provide groundwork for larger fMRI work in the domain of PER. Ultimately, we aim to use this work as the first phase of a study seeking to identify biological evidence to operationalize engagement, embodied experience, and conceptual metaphor in physics problem solving.

Have you ever considered doing away with lectures and traditional exams? Imagine a class in which there are no formal lectures and no exams. Envision students coming prepared for class. Instead of memorizing strands of equations or regurgitating concepts, students take ownership of their learning. They become passionate about learning physics because month-long projects provide the motivation for the learning. What if conceptual learning gains in such a class were more than double that of a traditional class? Welcome to Applied Physics 50, our introductory applied physics course that is team-based and project-based.

Multiple-choice assessments are a standard tool for achieving reliable measures of certain aspects of students' conceptual learning in large introductory physics courses. However, upper-division physics involves greater emphasis on assessing students' reasoning in addition to their conceptual knowledge. In order to capture elements of student reasoning, the Colorado Upper-division Electrostatics (CUE) diagnostic was designed as an open-ended assessment. Unfortunately, the training required to score the CUE accurately limits its scalability. Using our extensive database of CUE responses to construct distractors, we created a multiple-choice version of the diagnostic. Our principal goal was preserving insights afforded by the open-ended format while exploiting the logistical advantages of a multiple-choice assessment. This new version explores the viability of a novel test format where students select multiple responses and receive partial credit based on the accuracy and consistency of their selections. Here, we present the development, scoring, and preliminary analysis of the multiple-choice CUE.

Characterizing faculty expectations is important to produce a comprehensive understanding of what knowledge students should acquire before and during a quantum mechanics course (QMC). We analyzed interviews conducted with faculty and students entering a QMC in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at Georgia State University. The interviews examine expectations regarding preparation, course material, and instructor's goals for a QMC. The goals of the interviews are to locate conflicts in perspective and to provide students with a "map" for areas that will help strengthen the knowledge and skills to be obtained before they enter a QMC. We report on contradictions and similarities in perceptions from interview data determined by coding the interviews and through the use of Activity Theory.

The concept of measurement is a fundamental idea in quantum mechanics. Ideas pertaining to quantum measurement have been shown to be difficult for both introductory and advanced students. This is understandable, since in learning quantum mechanics, students must successfully interpret a new mathematical and conceptual formalism and recognize how this new model differs from classical physics. We discuss some of the conceptual and reasoning difficulties that we have identified related to measurement in quantum mechanics, using illustrative examples from written and online pretests and from post-tests administered on course examinations.

The context of this study is a calculus-based introductory college physics course that is a studio-format course implementing the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE). Our study analyzes students' interactions as they work together in groups, engaging in experimental design and how their interactions are related to their problem-solving performance in exams. Students are first given an experimental design problem. They must solve the design problem and learn new physics by working together in groups of three and collaborating together as a whole class. A day later they take an individual exam in which one of the problems is related to the experimental design problem they encountered previously. Using video data, we identify different ways in which students participate in group discussions when they engage in the experimental design problem. We then see if there are patterns in their participation that are connected to their performance on the related exam question.

Many large-enrollment introductory physics courses now use personal response devices (clickers) to engage students during class and collect data for real-time formative assessment. However, most systems only allow for multiple-choice or in some cases numeric or simple text answers.A program called inkSurvey allows faculty to ask more open-ended questions and students can submit both text and graphical responses from tablet computers. This provides faculty much greater insight into a student's problem-solving process. In our pilot project, standard clickers were used in the first half of a calculus-based physics I course, and in the second half of the semester, tablets and inkSurvey were used to collect formative assessment data.We will report on impressions of both the faculty and students regarding the relative utility and effectiveness of each tool in promoting higher-order thinking and improved class performance.

Physics education research has been making progress in providing research-based instructional techniques and tools to help assess the complex learning goals associated with a mature understanding of physics. We conducted semi-structured interviews with faculty members and students entering a quantum mechanics course in the Physics & Astronomy Department of Georgia State University. The interviews examine perspectives on what types of evaluation are most appropriate for an upper-division course. The types of evaluation discussed are multiple-choice questions, short-answer questions, traditional written problems, student presentations, and one-on-one oral exams. A post-course survey was offered to the students that took the QMC that semester and those who completed the course in recent history. We present the data associated with multiple-choice questions and oral exams.

Quantum mechanics suggests a new picture of physical systems that often is in conflict with students' classical views. For example, the underlying principle of orthonormality of state vectors is not necessarily aligned with student mental models of three- dimensional space vectors. Researchers have found that these classical views can create barriers in student learning of quantum concepts. Some researchers have postulated that introducing quantum ideas in an unfamiliar context such as spin (that does not have a classical counter part) might reduce the likelihoods of activating students' classical resources. To test this, we have experimented with teaching quantum mechanics using two different textbook approaches: (1) traditional approach (starting with continuous basis); (2) spin first approach (starting with discrete basis). We have investigated student learning of the core concepts using classroom concept questions and end of quarter diagnostic tests. We will discuss the implications of this study for choices of initial context, the order and emphasis of content being taught, as well as how Physics Education Research-based curriculum could be utilized to increase student engagement and learning in these courses.

Purdue University has the second largest international student enrollment in the country, which translated to nearly 40% self-reported international students in our fall 2012 calculus-based introductory mechanics course. Surprisingly, both international and domestic populations have 25% female students. Contrary to expectations, preliminary examination of student exams scores show that the international female students were the highest performing students in our introductory calculus-based mechanics course. An obvious conclusion is that the international female population are simply better prepared for the course, except that analysis of pre-test results of the Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning show no difference between the populations. In this poster we present a further investigation of these results.

Quantum states are traditionally cognitively managed exclusively with algebra rather than geometry. One reason for emphasizing algebra is the high dimensionality of quantum mathematical systems; even spin-1/2 systems require a 2-d complex number space for describing their quantum states, which can be hard to visualize. Using "nested phasor diagrams," which use nesting to increase the dimensionality of graphic space, we taught undergraduate students to represent spin-1/2 states graphically as well as algebraically. In oral exams, students were asked to identify which spin-1/2 states, expressed numerically, would generate the same set of probabilities as each other (i.e., they are the same except for a different overall phase factor). Video records of oral exams show that no students (N=13) performed this task successfully using an algebraic method; instead, all students solved the problem graphically. Furthermore, every student who succeeded used a certain gesture to solve the problem.

We compare student gestures from oral exams in an undergraduate quantum mechanics course for two academic years, 2012 and 2013. In both years, students were asked to show with their hands the quantum wave function for various one-dimensional potentials by assigning the three available spatial dimensions to the real part of the function, the imaginary part of the function, and the scenario's single spatial coordinate. In 2012, the students' instructor encouraged visualization of the wave function in these terms by gesturing frequently and by explaining 2-d quantum simulations in 3-d. In 2013, instruction included several in-class activities involving building a 3-d representation of the quantum wave function for several potentials using pipe cleaners. The oral exam in 2013 did not, however, include the pipe cleaners. We present evidence of the influence of the pipe cleaners on students' cognitive management, including embodied action, of the wave function.

Courses on circuit analysis for students in electrical or mechanical engineering often focus on algorithms for solving circuit problems that are presented in the form of standard circuit diagrams. Research has shown that many students have difficulty developing a conceptual understanding of basic concepts such as current and voltage. At Hamburg University of Technology, we have begun to investigate to what extent students are able to recognize the model aspects of (linear) circuit theory. In particular, we probe student understanding of (1) the connection between graphical and mathematical representations of circuits, (2) the connection between the elements of circuit theory and their real-world correspondents, (3) the "syntax" (i.e., set of rules) underlying circuit diagrams, and (4) the limitations of the linear circuit model and its idealized elements. We will present some initial results, indicate how these relate to previously identified conceptual difficulties, and show their relevance for instruction.

Numerous studies show courses taught using Peer Instruction have higher learning gains than traditional courses on standardized assessments. Yet we have very few measurements of what actually happens during the peer discussion component of this pedagogy. To address this need, we recorded every student discussion in nearly every lecture of an introductory physics course at a major research university. We will present results from analysis of these student conversations, providing insight on discussion behavior over different questions. In addition, we will illustrate the interesting case of "discovery conversations," in which all students in a group answer incorrectly in the initial poll and discuss only among their group, but one or more group members answer correctly after discussion.

The physics education research (PER) group at the University of Minnesota has been developing online computer programs intended to aid students in developing problem-solving skills by coaching them in the use of an expert-like problem-solving framework. An early version was tested in a large calculus-based introductory physics class and judged to be helpful by students. The PER group is now working on a second generation of coaches which is more flexible for both students and instructors. The new coaches will allow students to make the decisions critical to problem solving in a non-linear path, more closely resembling the actual way they solve problems. It will also allow instructors without any programming experience to modify both the structure and content of existing coaches and to create new ones. In this talk we will demonstrate the new interface and discuss the rationale behind its design. This work is supported by NSF DUE-1226197.

Purdue University's IMPACT program facilitates the transformation of large enrollment by incorporating interactive engagement methods into a course. As participants in this program, the researchers reformed Purdue's fall 2012 introductory calculus-based mechanics course, Phys 172: Modern Mechanics, by developing a series of Multimedia Learning Modules (MLMs) for use with the Matter and Interaction text. In addition, the one-hour weekly recitations were redesigned to enhance students' problem-solving skills by utilizing cooperative group problem solving. Finally, the two-hour weekly labs were partially redesigned to enhance students' computational modeling skills. To evaluate the effectiveness of this reformed course, data analysis included student pre-test/ post-test results from Lawson's Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning, Primary Trait Analysis of student exams and student responses to an anonymous survey. The IMPACT program provided additional data. This poster presents results of this evaluation, as well as suggestions for improvement for next fall.

The degree to which students struggle with basic mathematics in introductory physics is often surprising, even to experienced instructors. As part of an ongoing investigation into student use of proportions in introductory physics, we have been looking at student responses to questions about proportions in physics and in everyday contexts. At times it seems that the difficulties we are observing have less to do with the proportions themselves than with fundamental differences between how students and physics instructors think about the purposes of mathematics and about the meanings of mathematical expressions. This in turn has led us to look for ways that math as it is taught in math classes is different from math as it is used in introductory physics classes. In this talk I will describe some of these differences.

We introduce implicit scaffolding, a research-based theoretical framework we use to design PhET interactive simulations (sims) for inquiry learning. Scaffolding is usually explicit, consisting of prompts, questions, and other forms of guidance. Implicit scaffolding leverages affordance and constraints carefully chosen and built into PhET sims in order to guide without students feeling guided. By making scaffolding implicit, we aim to specifically address affective goals such as student agency, ownership, and productive, self-directed exploration. When scaffolding is implicit, student epistemological framing of their exploration with a sim can be more aligned with the self-directed, personally rewarding exploration done by scientists than when scaffolding is explicit. Additionally, implicitly scaffolded sims provide opportunities for instructors to design and facilitate classroom activities that are 1) more student-centered, and 2) more focused on conceptual learning. Implications for learning tools beyond PhET sims will be discussed.

Recent work in PER has examined the impact of scientific reasoning ability on student learning gains in introductory physics courses. Proportional reasoning is typically included as an important part of scientific reasoning. Proportional reasoning, however, is not well defined or monolithic, but rather consists of a variety of components, with expertise characterized by skill in selecting from among these components and fluency in shifting from one to another. An ongoing collaboration between Western Washington University, New Mexico State University, and Rutgers seeks to map the cognitive terrain in this area by developing a set of proportional reasoning components and designing assessment items to probe ability along those components. Free-response versions of these items have been tested extensively with students. Responses have been used to develop a suite of multiple choice items. This talk will describe the assessment suite and present results from a variety of introductory physics courses.

In physics, external representations (like graphs or free-body diagrams) are used to document and communicate information about a physical situation, and also as tools for computation. An important instructional goal is to teach students to solve problems using physical representations. Yet, while experts use representations fluently and productively, novices often struggle to interpret them and may not value their utility. In addressing this, we use conceptual blending theory and distributed cognition to gain insight into how meaning and computational power arise from the material and conceptual features of representations. In this talk, we apply these ideas to understanding how students create and use external representations for solving problems. In particular, we discuss how conflicts among material and conceptual elements of representations may lead students to misuse or misunderstand external representations, and how looking for such conflicts may help to identify potential areas of student difficulties.

An introductory college physics class was taught using a "flipped format" in a liberal arts college setting. Outside class, students viewed over 75 online video lectures on introductory mechanics prepared by this author using an inexpensive high-definition webcam and Relay Camtasia software. Videos ranging from five to 20 minutes long were made available via Blackboard, which enabled tracking of viewing. Inside the class, the students mostly worked through PER-based, activity-based tutorials and occasionally solved problems. A professor with one or two undergraduate TAs served more as facilitators in student-centered, peer-learning-based activities. I will report on the learning gains, which were significant, as measured by standard pre- and post-learning physics diagnostic tests.

From the early 1970s onward, the Physics Education Group in the Physics Department at the University of Washington (UW) has worked toward establishing physics education research (PER) as an appropriate field for scientific inquiry in physics departments. In 1999 APS and AAPT issued a joint resolution in strong support of PER by physics faculty, post-docs, and graduate students. Since then, the field has grown rapidly. It is still difficult, however, to establish a viable group in PER, especially at research-intensive universities.

We investigate introductory physics students' difficulties in translating between mathematical and graphical representations and the effect of scaffolding on students' performance. We gave a typical problem that can be solved using Gauss's law to 96 calculus-based introductory physics students. Students were asked to write an expression for the electric field in various regions and graph it. We implemented two scaffolding interventions to help them: (1) students were asked to draw the electric field in each region first (before having to plot it at the end) or (2) asked to draw the electric field in each region and asked to evaluate the electric field at the beginning, mid and end points of each region. The comparison group was only asked to plot the electric field at the end of the problem. We also conducted interviews in order to better understand how the interventions impacted them. We will present some surprising results.

The difference in performance of students primarily watching video to those primarily attending lecture on in-semester examinations and the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism will be presented. The effect of the access to video on student study behavior and time management will be analyzed. In general, while the students electing to primarily watch video were a measurably different population than the students electing to primarily attend lecture, the shift in performance from attending lecture to watching video was small.

Reliable and validated assessments of introductory physics have been instrumental in driving curricular and pedagogical reforms that lead to improved student learning.

The Colorado Classical Mechanics/Math Methods Instrument (CCMI) builds on faculty-consensus learning goals and systematic observations of student difficulties. The result is a nine-question open-ended post-test (with two additional, optional questions) that probes student learning in the first half of a two-semester sequence that combines classical mechanics with mathematical methods. In this paper, we describe the design and development of this instrument, its validation, and measurements made in classes at CU Boulder and elsewhere.

The Video Resource for Professional Development of University Physics Educators is being developed to support a wide range of university physics educators (four-year university faculty, two-year-college faculty, graduate teaching assistants, and undergraduate learning assistants) in engaging with key issues in teaching and learning. Based on compelling classroom video of best-practices university physics instruction, the resource is organized into "video workshops" that each introduce a significant topic in the teaching and learning of physics, such as formative assessment or cooperative learning. The topic is introduced through a captioned video episode of introductory physics students in the classroom, chosen to prompt collaborative discussion. Discussion questions prompt participants who view the episode to reflect on their pedagogical beliefs and on their own practice. The Video Resource will provide materials to be incorporated into a variety of professional development situations, including self-organized groups of professors, graduate TA training, LA pedagogy courses, and online professional development communities.

It is commonly expected that, after instruction, students will consciously and systematically construct reasoning chains that start from established scientific principles and lead to well-justified predictions. Poor student performance on exams is often attributed to a lack of understanding or an inability to construct inferential reasoning chains. Psychological research, however, seems to indicate that thinking processes often follow paths that are strikingly different from those outlined above. The extended heuristic-analytic theory of thinking and reasoning suggests that two types of cognitive processes are involved in building inferences: heuristic and analytical. Some researchers argue that metacognition mediates the connection between the two. In this talk, we will illustrate the applicability of this theory to student performance on written questions and describe the theory's relevance to efforts to probe student metacognitive abilities.

Since physics identity is related to physics career choice and persistence, it is valuable to understand what helps students develop a physics identity and what other attitudes are related to physics identity. Recent work suggests characteristics of interdisciplinary thinking are related to having a higher physics identity. However, the nature of this connection is still unexplained. This qualitative study examines students' interdisciplinary actions and beliefs, particularly with respect to their physics classes, as well as their physics identity. Through analysis of interviews and classroom observations, we seek to explain how these actions and beliefs may be related to students' physics identity, i.e. the possible mechanisms by which one may influence the other and how such mechanisms are activated.

We describe the results of an introductory physics Massively Open Online Course (MOOC) offered through Coursera during summer and fall 2013. This MOOC, modeled after an on-campus implementation of an introductory mechanic course, engages students in activities involving interactive lectures, homework, exams, forum discussion, and laboratories. Student demographics, participation, and performance on various assessment tools (e.g., the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation) will be presented. Specific challenges in data collection will also be discussed.

This presentation reports on a comparative study on students' problem solving performances when they use one of the two most popular open resources: either their own equation sheets or instructor-provided equation sheets. The study was carried out for four semesters in an introductory-level physics course. Student cohorts of previous two semesters were allowed to bring their own equation sheets for their tests whereas the student cohorts of the latter two semesters were provided the instructor prepared equation sheets. The results of the two implementations were compared using students' test scores and scores on various problem-solving categories indicated by a problem-solving rubric. This study revealed a relationship between student performance and the quality of their equations sheets. In addition, we found that use of instructor-prepared equation sheets have more positive influence on student performance as compared to student prepared equation sheets.

Often, research into physics education is focused on seeking out practices that improve student outcomes--such as improved conceptual gains, motivation, etc.--in comparison to the status quo of traditional/unreformed practices. Recently, we have instead validated a construct of student "disaffection" to identify practices that are significantly associated to this undesirable, negative student attitude. Using regression analysis on nationally representative college student data, we identify high school physics experiences that are associated to student disaffection including, importantly, having a teacher who relies more regularly on lecturing. There are gender interactions as well, such that women's disaffection is strongly related to their evaluations of their high school physics teachers (lower evaluations are associated to higher disaffection), whereas men show no such relationship.

Assessing student performance becomes challenging when course enrollment becomes very large (~10^5 students). As part of an introductory physics Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) offered by Georgia Institute of Technology, students submit video reports on force and motion labs. Peer evaluation of reports provides the primary method for evaluating student laboratory work. This paper describes the methods developed and used to guide students in evaluating each others' video lab reports when the course is offered in summer 2013 and fall 2013. Results of how students' peer evaluation compares to experts' evaluation will be presented.

Energy Tracking Representations [1,2], developed by Seattle Pacific University Energy Project researchers, are designed to track energy as it transfers and transforms in complex, real-world scenarios. Learners represent transfers and transformations by arrows that connect symbols representing forms of energy (e.g., K --> T represents a transformation of kinetic to thermal energy within an object, and K --> K represents a transfer of kinetic energy between two objects). Recent professional development efforts have supported teachers in not only identifying different kinds of transfer and transformation processes, but also in developing models for those processes. In this talk, we offer examples of the models K-12 teachers negotiated for specific transfers and transformations, and describe the effect of the negotiation process on their understanding of energy.

We present the impact of incorporating physics education research-based (PER) materials into our lecture-supported mini-studios for introductory algebra-based physics. These courses are being redesigned to provide improved integration of traditional lecture, recitation, and laboratory components for a large number of introductory students who cannot be served by our limited number of full-studio courses. Previously, worksheet materials for the three-hour lab portion of the mini-studio were mostly in-house designed. We have updated these worksheets with exercises from the Maryland Open Source Tutorials and the Minnesota Context-Rich Problem archive. Our previous results have shown lecture-supported mini-studios to perform similarly to or better than studio-based courses on standard conceptual and attitudinal assessments. We will investigate the sustainability of this trend with our redesigned worksheets, and document our struggles to identify existing PER-based materials for some topics.

The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)[1] identify eight practices as essential to science and engineering, and several of these emphasize the role of students' constructing explanations, engaging in argumentation, and communicating scientific information. However, few teacher-training programs instruct teachers on how to facilitate discourse in the classroom. Developed at Arizona State University, Modeling Instruction[2] emphasizes the role of student discourse in the construction of scientific knowledge by having students participate in large group conversations called whiteboard meetings. However, the novelty of this conversation format can inhibit student participation and make the facilitation of this discourse mode quite challenging. This research is a portion of one high school teacher's self study analyzing his experiences facilitating discourse in his attempt to move students closer to those practices espoused by the NGSS.

This study seeks to understand the patterns of formation of spontaneous learning communities outside the classroom from the students of a calculus-based introductory college physics class that is a studio-format course implementing the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE). We build up a network pattern among students from the self-reported data about who works with whom every week during the whole semester. Our study also analyzes the relationship between students' network position or status as they work together in groups outside the classroom, their interactions in the classroom, and their performance on homework and exams.

Georgia State University's Learning Assistant program recruits undergraduates to assist with instruction in our introductory algebra-based physics courses. Although the Learning Assistant model has been shown to be effective at enhancing student learning, little is known about the obstacles that Learning Assistants face. How do these obstacles evolve over the semester, and how do Learning Assistants deal with them? In order to investigate these questions, we interviewed four learning assistants who were assigned to SCALE-UP studio physics courses. We arranged four interviews with each Learning Assistant and examined all of their weekly essays written for the required science pedagogy course. We analyzed this data using constant comparative analysis, a technique associated with the grounded theory approach to qualitative research. The Learning Assistants described many barriers that they encountered including student disengagement, difficulty finding the right question to ask, and others.

Prior research has emphasized the importance of recognition to physics identity development. In this study, we examine the coherence between students' perceptions of their physics teacher recognizing them and the beliefs of physics teachers with regards to students. We draw on data from four case studies of physics teachers and their classes. Our quantitative analysis revealed that one of the teachers, Dr. D, had a different coherence pattern. His students also perceived greater recognition and identified more as being a "physics person" than the students of the other teachers. Focusing in on a student with the lowest coherence, Kristina, we examine the ways in which Dr. D's actions served to help her feel recognized -- actions that superseded his beliefs about her. Our results indicate that despite his beliefs (about her and his other students on average), his actions facilitated students seeing themselves in positive ways with respect to physics.

In most energy scenarios, thermal energy is produced and dissipated. For example, when a ball rolls to a stop, kinetic energy transforms into thermal energy that spreads into the environment. The ball's movement is a perceptible indicator of the presence of kinetic energy. The thermal energy, however, is likely to be imperceptible, and as the ball slows, the decrease of a perceptible indicator can seem to suggest a violation of the principle of energy conservation. We present data of teachers-as-learners working to identify evidence of energy which has lost its perceptible indicators. We argue that mechanisms of energy transformation constitute evidence of imperceptible energy for learners.

For at least 90 years, physics educators have attempted to improve instructional practices through systematic analysis of student-learning data. I will review some of the highlights of these investigations in order to focus on key issues and problems that have surfaced. For example, although some analysis of students' physics ideas had occurred in the 1930s and 1940s, implementation of instructional materials based closely on such research did not take place until the 1970s. I will also address the evolution in diagnostic instruments and offer perspective on issues related to statistical analysis of assessment data, the validity of observational protocols, and trade-offs between practicality and reliability. *Supported in part by NSF DUE #1256333

A preliminary study in a spring 2013 introductory physics for life sciences (IPLS) course focused on a metacognitive activity of reflecting on a chosen homework problem during the initial portion of each lab over the duration of the course, with the assistance of a reflection rubric. Artifact data was gathered from a MPEX pre-post survey, students' reflection attempts and exam solutions, and a post-test reflection survey. Combined data suggested that students were of mixed-to-positive opinion of the metacognitive activity. While students appeared to benefit somewhat, many chose to obviate the exercise a priori by obtaining the correct solution for the homework problem in advance. To explore the robustness of these indications, implementations to the exercise were made to be more ergonomic to the course material and prevent this occurrence. We revisit the preliminary data from last spring in light of the fall semester's progress.

As part of a new effort at the University of Maine to investigate the learning and teaching of concepts in thermodynamics and electronics that are integral to both undergraduate physics and engineering programs, we have been examining student learning in electrical engineering and physics courses on electric circuits and electronics. A major goal of this work at the physics-engineering interface is to probe the extent to which the nature of student understanding (including the prevalence of specific difficulties) depends upon the disciplinary context. In this talk, I will focus on our efforts to probe student understanding of basic operational-amplifier circuits using free-response questions. Preliminary results from questions administered in both physics and engineering courses will be presented. *This work has been supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.

Models are simplified and abstract representations of real-world phenomena that are used for creating and communicating scientific explanations. In this study we analyze students' use of models in a 30-minute think-aloud lab activity involving basic electronic and optical components. The framework used for our fine-grained analysis of modeling during experimentation was developed independently in the context of curriculum development for upper-division physics laboratories. We review general patterns in students' use of models, describe our coding scheme, and conclude with a discussion of implications for the design of modeling-focused lab activities and lab-appropriate assessments.

Numerous studies have identified student conceptions about buoyancy, but most of those studies involved children younger than 15 years old. As part of developing a standardized static fluids assessment, our research group is seeking to identify which of those conceptions persist into late high school and college. This fall, we used a Likert-style approach to our assessment, asking students to agree or disagree with individual statements (rather than choose from multiple options for a single physical situation). We also videotaped volunteers taking this assessment. This talk will report on some of our preliminary findings.

Have you ever journeyed to a learning environment in which students take ownership of their learning, one in which students are encouraged to take risks, a learning community in which life skills-sets are sharpened with real-world problem solving? Suppose in such a learning environment, all within the course of one year, introductory applied physics students: plan a manned or unmanned mission to Mars; design and build electromagnetic safe locking mechanisms; address the energy crisis; clean up the environment; design and build a musical instrument; and, create an intricate Rube Goldberg Machine. We invite you to Applied Physics 50*, a team-based and project-based learning community whereby students own their learning.

The wave phenomena typically discussed in introductory physics courses form the foundation for more advanced physics topics such as electrodynamics and quantum mechanics. However, it has been found that many students experience significant difficulties when they attempt to express a distance in terms of the wavelength of a periodic wave. The ability to perform such a basic task correctly is essential for understanding interference and diffraction phenomena. We hypothesized that the poor student performance on this type of task may stem from difficulties with visualizing the situation and reasoning spatially. We administered the Paper Folding Test (PFT) in order to assess students' visual-spatial skills. Then, we probed the relationship between these skills and student performance on tasks in the context of water waves. We have identified consistent and statistically significant differences in PFT scores between students who complete basic wave tasks correctly and those students who do not.

Metacognition, or "thinking about thinking," is known to be central in the practice of expert learners. Western Washington University introductory physics labs for science and engineering majors incorporate activities designed to encourage the development of metacognitive skills. In weekly writing exercises, students reflect on what they knew before instruction, what they learned during instruction, and how they learned it. Analyses of a large sample of student data has led to insights into how students' reflective writing can be used as a valuable source of data. Data will be presented and implications for both research and instruction will be discussed.

Educational Data Mining (EDM) uses different algorithms for analyze response and behavior in the teaching-learning process, these algorithms let researches to analyze and classify students' behavior or state of knowledge from different concepts; most of these algorithms have not been tested in Physics Education Research, this work presents the results obtained from applying three algorithms used by EDM for teaching different physics concepts applied to in-vivo experiments. These algorithms are: decision tree, rule induction, and fuzzy rule induction. The in-vivo experiments correspond to different active learning methodologies derived from research master degree thesis in the Physics Education Research Department from the Applied Science and Advance Technology Research Center of the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico.

This study aims to determine critical factors that explain differences in FCI gains among sections of algebra-based and calculus-based classes. In this study, FCI pre-test scores are found to be only moderately correlated with FCI post-scores and normalized gains, and Lawson CTSR scores are only weakly correlated. We conclude that measures of scientific reasoning ability and the level of prior knowledge of physics are not the most important factors in explaining course section differences. We report also on the development of a rubric for quantifying the degree of FCI content coverage. This work contributes to the PER community's efforts to identify a sufficiently complete set of factors impacting FCI gains and to determine the relative importance of the factors. Work in this area could guide curriculum reform to reduce students' misconceptions about Newtonian Thinking and allow them to learn more physics beyond the topics addressed by FCI.

Introductory calculus and non-calculus physics classes are combined into a single section with an additional calculus discussion section afterwards.

A gender-gap favoring males in outcomes such as conceptual knowledge, self-efficacy, attitudes and beliefs is common in introductory physics courses [1]. We investigated this issue by measuring students' in the moment stated feelings of self-efficacy and motivation throughout their daily lives, including in an introductory physics course. We also used trait surveys to measure gender gaps in the course consistent with prior research [1]. We found gender differences in physics favoring males on both measures. These findings trace the larger negative effect on female students' attitudes and beliefs about learning physics and their physics self-efficacy to their experiences occurring in the midst of physics instruction. This confronts researchers, educators, and administrators with the need for developing and implementing more equitable physics instruction.

Visual cues overlaid on diagrams and animations can help students attend to relevant features and facilitate problem solving. In this study we investigated the effects of visual cues on students' eye movements as they solved conceptual physics problems. Students (N=80) enrolled in an introductory physics course individually worked through four sets of problems, each containing a diagram, while their eye movements were recorded and provided verbal responses. The problem sets contained an initial problem, six isomorphic training problems, and a transfer problem. Those in the cued condition saw visual cues overlaid on the training problems. Each diagram contained regions that were alternatively relevant to solving the problem correctly or related to common incorrect responses. The cued group more accurately answered the transfer problems (which did not have cues), and their eye movements showed they more efficiently extracted the necessary information from the relevant area than the uncued group. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1138697.

We study the effects of a computer-based training process on pre-service elementary teachers' reasoning on introductory physics problems with diagrams. The training process contains four problem sets that target commonly known nave conceptions in physics. The problems include physics diagrams and text and require conceptual reasoning rather than computation. Each problem set has three training problems followed by solutions, one near transfer problem, and one far transfer problem. We have analyzed students' verbal answers to elucidate the reasoning resources that they activated to construct the different explanations that they gave in response to the problems. We found that the students changed their reasoning dramatically through the process as they were presented with solutions to training problems and later posed a transfer problem. Our results provide insights into students' activation of their resources and the procedures they used to construct their reasoning in response to the training problems.

Worked examples are common tools used to give students information about solution procedures, often as feedback after students fail to successfully complete a problem.

In an attempt to see the effect of mastery learning in physics, we created materials for an introductory electromagnetism course that tested superposition of electric fields, followed by electric potential, two subjects that have notoriously been difficult for our students. We presented these sets of questions in mastery mode, as a single presentation, or not at all, and compared performance on a written assessment. The effect of these tools, especially the mechanism for delivery (mastery or not), will be discussed and results will be shown.

We have developed and tested prototype online exercises targeted for specific learning objectives in introductory physics. These exercises are delivered in a "mastery" mode. That is, students are given a set of questions; if they do not answer correctly the minimum number required for mastery, they are given access to narrated animated solutions to these questions after which they are presented with a new set of questions. This process continues until the students achieve mastery. We will discuss the design of these questions and their solutions and present preliminary data on student learning from these exercises.

Research has demonstrated that using visual cues can help to direct students' attention to relevant areas of a diagram and facilitate problem solving. In this study, we investigate the effect of visual cues and correctness feedback in conceptual physics problems containing a diagram with respect to the comprehension of physics concepts. Students enrolled in an introductory mechanics course were individually interviewed. Using think-aloud protocol, students worked through four sets of problems containing a diagram. Each problem set contained an initial problem, six isomorphic training problems, a near transfer problem, and a far transfer problem. The students provided verbal responses to the problems. Students in the cued condition saw visual cues on the training problems, and students in the feedback condition were told whether their responses were correct or incorrect. We discuss the influence of both cueing and feedback on students' ability to solve the training and transfer problems.

Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) is an important aspect in the preparation of future teachers. The Concepts of Physics (CoP) course at Kansas State University has been recently redesigned to infuse PCK for pre-service elementary teachers. CoP integrates the learning of physics concepts with children's ideas about those concepts. The course is structured around the pedagogical learning bicycle, which bridges the learning of content with pedagogy through metacognitive reflection. As a final class project, students are required to work in groups to develop a lesson plan on one of the topics taught during the semester. In this talk I describe how we assess the impact of the class on students' PCK. We evaluated their projects based on how they incorporated their understanding of children's ideas on the specific topic to develop age-appropriate strategies to facilitate children's learning of these concepts. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant 1140855.

One important goal for physics education is to help students develop reasoning patterns similar to those of physicists. But what does a physicist actually do that enables her/him to successfully understand and solve challenging, novel problems? To answer this question we performed fine-grained discourse analysis on video recordings of physics experts attempting to solve novel problems using the framework of resources. We focused on episodes during the problem solving process when experts reasoned towards a deeper understanding of the phenomenon they were observing. By searching for patterns across many episodes, we identified candidate resources with epistemological underpinnings, which help experts when they are making conceptual breakthroughs when solving novel problems. We discuss the frequency with which resource candidates were used by experts and the instructional implications of these findings.

A followup experiment was conducted to understand the optimal conditions for helping students learn from practice exams.

Metacognition, the monitoring and regulation of one's thinking, plays an important role in developing conceptual understanding and facilitating effective problem solving. To date, relatively little work has focused on the role of student metacognition in qualitative inferential reasoning. We have collected audio, video, and real-time written data in order to identify instances of socially mediated metacognition[1] that occur while introductory physics students work through qualitative problems. In particular, we use multi-part questions that tend to elicit inconsistencies in student reasoning, even when students possess the requisite conceptual understanding. This work is part of a broader effort to identify methods for improving students learning in physics by explicitly supporting and enhancing students' metacognitive abilities. Preliminary findings as well as specific examples will be presented. * This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. DUE-1245313, DUE-1245999, and DUE-0962805.

Improving computer literacy is a large focus, and is necessary in preparation for the next-generation science standards.

Force, velocity, and acceleration represent an interesting set of related physics concepts in that they are foundational, well-documented and a persistent source of student difficulty even after instruction. As such, this set of related concepts provides a unique conceptual space in which to explore the effects of different question formats and their role in targeting persistent student difficulties during computer-based training and instruction. By prompting students to respond to questions in natural language and subsequently providing immediate question specific feedback, we explore the potential benefit of natural language for targeting specific and persistent difficulties like the assumption of a force in the direction of motion. We report on the design and construction of a simple natural language computer tutor for concepts in one-dimensional force and motion and investigate the relative effectiveness of the natural language question and feedback format versus traditional multiple choice questions and responses.

The acquisition metaphor of learning is often used by teachers of physics: Students acquire a particular concept, and then transfer this concept to new contexts. In particular, one might say students acquire the mathematical concept of "vector addition" and apply it in (transfer it to) numerous physical contexts. In this study, 200 freshmen taking an introductory physics course were asked to calculate the total force, total displacement and total momentum in simple contexts involving vector addition at right angles. Another similar group of 200 students were asked to calculate the net force, net displacement, and net momentum. The students did significantly worse when adding momenta, and they did significantly better when asked to calculate the "net" quantity (rather than the "total" quantity). These results are inconsistent with a basic "acquisition -transfer" perspective of learning. A fine-grained analysis of subsequent interviews and questionnaires was also conducted.

Achieving physics expertise requires various expert skills beyond conceptual understanding, such as mapping between different representations, or devising a qualitative overall plan. Research have shown that the most effective method to develop expertise in any field is through "deliberate practice": carefully designed repetitive practice focused on a specific expert skill. However, most traditional back of the textbook problems are poor candidates of deliberate practice activities, as they often require multiple skills to solve. We will briefly introduce our initial attempts of developing "deliberate practice problems" for introductory mechanics. These highly focused problems are carefully designed to train one aspect of expert skill at a time, utilizing the new "Drag and drop" format of the edX platform to reduce extraneous cognitive load. We will show a couple of example problems, and also report the initial response from students when we deploy those problems in a flipped classroom.

Students' mathematical skill level is often considered a good indicator of their success in introductory physics courses. It is a common expectation that students who meet the prerequisite requirement will be well-prepared; however, this is rarely the case. In a recent study at the Department of Physics and Astronomy of Eastern Kentucky University, a math diagnostic test is given pre-instruction in an algebra-based physics course to evaluate their math skills. We then interviewed six students who were on the borderline in the entrance math diagnostic test. To investigate their physics problem solving skills, we gave them questions that included both math-intensive questions and context rich problems. The connection between students' mathematical skills and their physics problem-solving skills is discussed in detail.

The activity, Circuit Theater, involves students playing the role of electric charges as they act out the behavior of various circuits involving batteries and light bulbs. A subset of questions from the Determining and Interpreting Resistive Electric Circuits Concepts Test (DIRECT) were administered before and after Circuit Theater activities in a calculus-based physics course at Howard Community College. Normalized gains for students participating in Circuit Theater average 49% after one week of activities. We also report on possible learning retention suggested by performance on the unit exam and the final exam.

The Inquiry into Radioactivity (IiR) project is developing course materials for radiation literacy. Student thinking about what constitutes ionizing radiation is a major learning difficulty. Most people use "radiation" and "radioactive" interchangeably, and talk of ionizing radiation as "bad stuff" that can transfer to other objects, making them radioactive. These matter -- like ideas persist and interfere with the particle view. This paper reports on a longitudinal study of student thinking. Some students accepted the particle view after investigations with Geiger counters, but others did not adopt the particle view until grappling with atoms and with ionization by alpha, beta, and gamma particles. Thus we reluctantly conclude that brief or incomplete efforts to teach radiation to non-science learners will fail to incite the substantial ontological shift that is essential to understanding radiation as particles.

Physics education research (PER) indicates that research-based instructional strategies (RBIS) such as studio classes and research-based text materials (Physics by Inquiry) could be used widely to improve students' learning gains and conceptual understanding. However, the effectiveness of RBIS is not universal; non-physics majors fail to understand subjects in algebra-based courses at some institutions. This could be due to many reasons, such as different implementations of studio physics or different teaching strategies. Course documents also have impacts on the learning environment. As part of a collaborative study among GSU, GW and UCF, we have collected and analysed available course documents, such as experiments and quizzes. The analysis is based on the differences between course documents (experiments, activities) among these three institutions and comparison of these documents to those prepared by the instructors with PER-based documents.

We examine the effects of training examples on student responses to questions about the relationships between the directions of net force, velocity, and acceleration in one-dimension. Six training conditions were constructed, each dealing exclusively with one combination of net force, velocity, and acceleration (e.g., "given a velocity in this direction, what can you say about the acceleration"?) in a variety of contexts and added to a control condition (no training). While we find that acceleration-velocity and net force-velocity trainings led to the highest overall scores, we also find complex but robust interactions between training and test question types, consistent with hierarchies of student understanding of force and motion in previous works. Based on the empirical data we gathered, we build mathematical models of these hierarchies. We then use those models to predict which combinations of training are most effective, which is in turn suggestive of instructional strategies.

In Fall 2013, Georgia Tech began offering a "flipped" introductory calculus-based mechanics class as an alternative to the traditional large-enrollment lecture class. This class "flips" instruction by introducing new material outside of the classroom through pre-recorded, lecture videos that feature in-video "clicker" questions. Classroom time is spent working in small groups solving problems, practicing scientific communication, and peer evaluation. Video lectures constitute students' initial introduction to course material. We analyze how students engage with online lecture videos via "clickstream" data. Clickstream data consists of time-stamped interactions with the online video player. Plays, pauses, seeks, and other events are recorded when the student interacts with the video player. Patterns in this behavior can emerge and be used to highlight areas of interest in the video and improve the overall video delivery for future iterations of this course.

Although there has been interest in problem/project-based learning in the PER community as an active engagement strategy, most work done to date, however, has focused on introductory courses. This talk will explore research on upper-division quantum mechanics, a junior/senior level course at Creighton University, which was taught using PBL pedagogy with no in-class lectures. Course time was primarily spent on lecture tutorials and projects, which included the alpha decay of Uranium, neutrino oscillations, spin oscillations/NMR, and FTIR spectroscopy of HCl.

The Physics Education Research Group at the University of Minnesota (UMN) is investigating the utility of a type of online computer coach to promote learning and aid in the development of problem-solving skills in an introductory physics course. The first version of these coaches was used in the first semester of large calculus-based introductory mechanics courses at UMN. The utility of the coaches depends on their ease of use and their attractiveness to students as well as their efficacy. In this talk, we describe the techniques used to measure the utility of the coaches when used as a part of the introductory course. This talk will also address the natural use of the coaches by different segments of the student population within the class. Q. Ryan, B. Aryal, and J-L. Lin also contributed to this work.

Understanding issues of diversity and equity in physics has historically taken the lens of documenting broad patterns of participation of women and ethnically underrepresented groups. This work has explored reasons for differing levels in participation including conceptual understanding, physics identity, and student self-efficacy. A common aim of this work has been to examine the impact of these variables on the prevalence of underrepresented groups in physics. We present an alternative lens on diversity and equity that centers on better understanding and supporting student trajectories of participation over time. Drawing from case study data of a biology major in an introductory physics class, we argue that access to a professional community of scientists must start from exposure to, participation in, and developing an affinity towards a variety of scientific practices. We articulate how this perspective informs a model of supporting diverse students who are commonly disenfranchised from physics.

While a number of studies have investigated student understanding of vector addition and subtraction as relevant to introductory physics, virtually all of these studies have only considered the arrow representation of vectors. In this study, we demonstrate that significantly -- and often overwhelmingly -- more students can correctly add and subtract vectors in the textual, component ijk-format compared to the arrow format in both generic and physics contexts. Furthermore, by prompting students for physical explanations of results, we find that students also exhibit an equal if not better understanding in the ijk-format compared to the arrow format. The arrow format typically induces an intuitive application of arrows, often resulting in incorrect answers. Overall, we find that the ijk-format tends to prompt students to use the arrow format correctly (and not vice versa), and this suggests that teaching the arrow format alone may not be as productive as teaching both representations simultaneously.

We have analyzed the performance of students enrolled in University of Colorado Physics I MOOC. The performance of the MOOC students is compared with that of students in the "Brick and Mortar" version of the course, Physics 1110. Identical instruments (FMCE, exams, homework) were used to evaluate both groups. While the completion rate of students enrolled in the MOOC was much lower than for those in the "Brick and Mortar" class, MOOC students performed as well as and had learning gains as great as those in the "Brick and Mortar" class. When MOOC students are compared with a similar group of Physics 1110 students, based on FMCE pre-tests, their performance lags but still compares favorably with that of students in a typical Physics I class.

A collection of targeted math skills questions were developed and incorporated into the standard, weekly homework exercises in a first semester, calculus-based mechanics course for science and engineering majors at the University of Illinois. These questions were designed to test the math skills that would nominally be used during the homework that week. This presentation gives our analysis of the students' performance on the math skills questions as compared with the corresponding physics questions. We conclude by discussing some of the implications of this study in regards to transfer of learning and possible contributing factors toward student difficulties in mechanics, as well as possibilities for improving student performance in calculation-based exercises.

While interdisciplinarity is often considered a worthy goal of education and a tool for better teaching, definitions of interdisciplinarity vary among education researchers and practitioners. In addition, researchers and practitioners usually focus on student performance on coursework that is considered to be interdisciplinary. What this perspective lacks is a consideration of the affective domain, namely student beliefs and attitudes about interdisciplinarity. Building on hypothesized dimensions of interdisciplinarity, we draw from a large-scale national survey to build a useful measure of interdisciplinary affinity. We also investigate how interdisciplinary affinity is related to students' physics and general STEM identities.

This study builds on past research that explored the effect of prior belief on students' ability to draw inferences. Results, indicating an effect of prior belief, are replicated and compared with statistical reasoning ability. 600 students in a calculus-based mechanics course participated in one of two conditions. In the first condition, data tables were presented within a physical context and students were given a short pre-test measuring their beliefs about the context. In the second, the tables were given within a generic context. Compared to students given the generic context, students given the physical context drew valid conclusions more frequently when the data aligned with their prior beliefs but less frequently when the data conflicted with their beliefs. Additionally, 270 students were given the Berlin Numeracy Test to evaluate their statistical numeracy. While results from previous studies have disagreed, in this case, students' numeracy was positively correlated with their correctness.

In addition to struggling with deep comprehension of physics concepts, students also struggle with essential, procedural skills that are necessary for the types of problem solving expected of them during introductory physics classes. Students in both semesters of introductory physics (mechanics and E&M;) and in multiple populations (algebra and calculus-based) have been shown to struggle with the essential skills of computing vector components and vector products. In this presentation, we present data on the effectiveness of a number of training conditions on student fluency with these vector skills. Through the use of simple computer-based training with answer-based feedback, the effects of different types of feedback -- as well as the presentation order of sub-skills and concepts-- are investigated.

"Calibration" is an aspect of metacognition that describes how well students assess their own knowledge. We have been engaged in a multi-year project to investigate the metacognitive calibration of students enrolled in introductory physics and chemistry courses at a small campus of a large public university. When assessed at the end of the semester, we found a large disparity between students' confidence in their ability to answer questions compared to their actual ability to provide the correct answer on a large number of questions that spanned the course material. We further investigated student calibration in a series of interviews designed to examine which question features and student behaviors might lead students to assess their knowledge more accurately. Data from written questions and one-on-one student interviews will be presented, and the implications these have for future investigations into student metacognition will be discussed.

This study was motivated by research findings suggesting that student conceptual and reasoning competence demonstrated on one task often fails to be exhibited on another. Even after targeted instruction, many undergraduate physics students fail to build reasoning chains from fundamental principles even though they possess the required knowledge and skills to do so. Instead, they often rely on a variety of intuitive reasoning strategies. In this study, we examined the extent to which students employ intuitive reasoning across multiple contexts (both related and unrelated). In addition, we wanted to see if the tendency to use a particular class of reasoning approaches (e.g., intuitive or formal) may be attributed to individual student thinking strategies in general. Data from introductory calculus-based physics courses will be presented and implications for instruction will be discussed. *This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.

Effective learners possess a diverse repertoire of metacognitive skills that they consciously deploy to support and guide their thinking. Adopting new thinking approaches is complex and demanding for novice learners, but the process can be facilitated by instructors actively supporting the development of students' metacognitive skills. As part of an ongoing investigation of student reasoning approaches in physics courses, we wish to identify instructional strategies that are effective at promoting the development of metacognitive skills in conjunction with the development of conceptual understanding of physics. We have been probing the effectiveness of such strategies across multiple learning environments (e.g., interactive lectures, laboratory). We will present data from question sequences purposefully designed to evoke metacognitive behavior. Results from individual and group work will be presented and compared. Implications for instruction will be discussed.

In an analysis of correct/incorrect responses during peer instruction in an introductory survey of physics course for undergraduates, students with previous subject experience were found to have a higher correct response rate before and after discussion than all other partner groupings. If a student with previous subject experience was paired with a student with no previous subject experience, there was an increase in correct response rate after discussion but no lasting benefit was found on end-of-unit exams. If a discussion pair consisted of two students with no previous subject experience, correct response rates were low and remained low after discussion. The nature of the pairing appears to influence correct response rates to questions posed during peer instruction and also influences student's attitudes about the course and the value of peer instruction.

Following the positive impact of the lecture-supported mini-studio format on student understanding in our first-semester algebra-based courses, we present the results of implementing the mini-studio format in our second-semester algebra-based courses. The mini-studio format provides improved integration of traditional lecture, recitation, and laboratory components for a large number of introductory students who cannot be served by our limited number of full-studio courses. During the three-hour laboratory portion of the mini-studio, students complete student-centered worksheets containing PER-based materials (e.g., exercises from Maryland Open Source Tutorials, Minnesota Context-Rich Problems, etc.) and then take quizzes on paper. Some students worked in our previous laboratory format, which entailed an instructor-led problem-solving session followed by individual quizzes completed online. We will investigate the effects of the mini-studio format on student understanding of second-semester material and on student attitudes toward physics and compare these results to those of other formats used for our second-semester algebra-based courses.

Studio physics courses and other interactive engagement methods have been found to improve student learning gains at multiple institutions. However, the same level of success is not found in all secondary implementations of these methods. There are several possible explanations for these differences in success, such as institutional differences and instructor effectiveness. As part of a project to explore the essential components for success of algebra-based studio physics courses, we would like to describe and compare characteristics of student populations at institutions with different levels of success. Studio-mode courses may be particularly vulnerable to differences in student populations since their student-centered nature places more responsibility on students. We will present the results of interviews conducted with faculty, student assistants and enrolled students at three universities to explore the characteristics they felt most significantly impacted individual students' success in studio mode courses and how these results inform the larger study.

Students' interactions can be an influential component of an interactive learning environment. We analyze video data of students working together while they learn physics from two consecutive semesters of a calculus-based introductory college physics course that implements the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) curriculum. We consider students' interaction patterns from two different viewpoints. The first is based on their positioning, in terms of equity, during peer interactions. The second is based on the structure of cognitive processes as described in the revised Bloom's Taxonomy. Using comparative analysis we examine the relationship between students' interactions in these two viewpoints and their learning as measured by performance in class exams and conceptual understanding. Additionally, we will attempt to identify the key characteristics and behaviors of "successful students," namely those who are able to fully exploit the affordances of a highly student-centered learning environment that places an emphasis on self-directed learning.

I will report on the results of a study designed to measure the effectiveness of an instructional strategy known as 2-stage exams or collaborative group exams. This exam format first has the students take the exam individually. Once all the students have handed in their individual exams, they organize into collaborative groups of three or four and take the same exam again with only a single copy of the exam being given to each group. Different versions of the group exam featured different subsets of the questions from the individual exam. Questions isomorphic to the exam questions will be administered on the end-of-course diagnostic and comparisons, using the relevant isomorphic question, will be made between the students that saw a given question on the group exam and those that did not.

We are interested to examine patterns of behavior and interactions amongst physics students as they learn in a highly interactive and student-centered learning environment. This environment is an introductory level studio-based ISLE physics class taught at Florida International University. We use a descriptive statistical approach and network analysis to identify productive or unproductive behavioral factors and try to quantify how these factors affect students' learning. We will report on interesting features and patterns that we discovered. In particular we consider the relative importance of factors such as how students participate in peer discussions while working on class activities, how much they take advantage of informal learning groups outside of class time, how they participate in whole-class discussions, and even whether students arrive on time to class or not.

A metacognitive exercise in problem solving was given to an introductory physics for life sciences (IPLS) class over the course of the fall 2013 and spring 2014 semester. The exercise featured scaffolding in the form of a rubric students could use to note where they struggled in a group problem solving effort. One of the concerns was that students who are not physics majors do not necessarily have the same epistemic framework as physics majors would for the classroom. As such, we examine written artifacts from the students' reflection activities for evidence of different epistemic games. We also describe a comparison of written artifacts to pre-post data from the FCI, MPEX, and CLASS surveys.

Advancements in technology have made electronic administration and grading of exams more prevalent. The staff of the Fundamentals of Engineering for Honors program at The Ohio State University recently began delivering a portion of each midterm and final exam via the university's online course management system. To assess whether changing to this style impacted student performance, a study was conducted to compare the two formats. For each exam in an introductory programming course, the computer-administered part of the test was split into an A half and a B half. Half of the students took part A on the computer and part B on paper, and vice/versa for the other half of the students. Additionally, students were asked a question about whether they had a preference for one format over the other. Results will be discussed, along with implications for the structure of future exams.

Energy is an abstract concept, but students and experts alike reason about energy using ontological metaphors: metaphors that indicate what kind of a thing energy is. These metaphors include energy as a substance ("This object has a lot of energy") and energy as a vertical location ("It dropped down to a lower energy"). Both of these metaphors can be productive, but each one has its limitations. In our previous work, we have shown that students and experts can productively combine the substance and location metaphors for energy and coordinate them coherently. Here, we examine instances in which students are using both metaphors, and argue that, in some cases, students blend these two separate metaphors into a single ontology for energy. To determine this, we employ an integrated methodology, analyzing both the verbal metaphors and the gestures that the students use.

Numerous studies indicate that spatial reasoning can play a role in STEM field success. Introductory university physics frequently requires students to construct integrals, a skill that may be influenced by spatial reasoning proficiency. We administered a straightforward physics problem requiring the construction of an integral to students enrolled in calculus-based introductory physics, and additionally measured their spatial reasoning ability using the Santa Barbara Solids Test. We found that the spatial reasoning score correlates moderately with overall performance on the integration task, as well as with various components of integral setup, such as correctly identifying cross-sectional area. Furthermore, we found that students who demonstrated a physical understanding of the integrand, via a simple multiple-choice question, were significantly more successful in constructing the integral, independent of spatial reasoning ability.These results suggest that, separately, both spatial reasoning and physical understanding of the integrand are important for constructing integrals in physics.

Assessment of problem-solving skills often poses some challenges in science programs. In particular, in large groups, for which several raters are involved, the question of the validity and reliability of the grading process can be legitimately challenged. A common approach to grading is to exploit a scoring scheme into which partial credits are attributed to distinct steps of the solution and points are deduced for errors. In the present work, two studies have been conducted to investigate whether the alternative use of rubrics may improve the grading process. The first was concerned with determining whether or not the rubrics developed for a class of freshman mechanics improve the scoring when compared to the traditional method. The second study used a revised version of the rubrics to verify the hypothesis that, with proper training, grading problem-solving using rubrics increases grading speed, agreement between graders and overall transparency of the grading process.

As part of an introductory physics course offered at Georgia Tech, students submit video reports on force and motion labs. Peer grading of reports provides the primary method for evaluating student laboratory work. During peer grading, students are guided to rate each others' videos on a rubric consisting of several likert-scale questions. They are also encouraged to provide written feedback explaining their grading for each rubric item. This paper explores how peer evaluations compare to instructors' evaluations by examining the likert-scale responses and written responses provide by both students and instructors. The written responses will be coded to understand what students and instructors attend to in their grading. Similarities and differences between student grading and expert grading will be discussed.

Improvements in student learning through interactive-engagement methods have been inconsistent over a range of institutions. Possible factors for these variations include institutional differences and instructor effectiveness. As part of a project to explore the key elements of successful algebra-based studio courses, we are conducting systematic observations and analyses of various classroom environments with regard to teaching methods, cognitive engagement, and instructor-student interactions. Our data are recorded as a chronological series of codes in the Teaching Dimensions Observational Protocol (TDOP) which reflect the classroom activities taking place at particular times. In order to test the efficacy of the TDOP computer-based tool, we are using an evidence-based approach for choosing an efficient set of codes grounded in PER. We will discuss the coding design process and our insights into studio-mode courses. We will outline the important factors impacting active learning in the classroom and discuss how the observations inform the broader study of successful studio physics.

Multiple-choice tests are commonly used in large introductoryphysics courses, but the format provides limited information about specific student weaknesses in problem solving. We seek to identify and characterize the role of physical process understanding in a multiple-choice format. To do this, we have written a collection of questions designed to assess students' understanding of the physical processes that occur in given scenarios. These questions were given to students in an introductory calculus-based mechanics course in a review context for each of the major examinations in the course. We have compared student performance on these questions to student performance in examinations and will discuss what these results reveal about this specific type of understanding in problem solving.

We have been investigating student understanding and application of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) in different physics contexts involving definite integrals. We conducted 14 semi-structured individual interviews with introductory physics students. Our analysis, using grounded theory, elicited various strategies to solve graphically based FTC problems. While many students struggled initially, at some point during the interviews students displayed the relevant and requisite mathematical knowledge, suggesting that they failed to access and/or apply the knowledge in the given physics contexts. Similar to prior studies on students dealing with mathematically based physics problems, we found the analysis perspectives of epistemological framing and epistemic games productive in interpreting some of the choices of strategies, the strategies themselves, and some individual steps observed. The framing perspective helps explain students' strategy-switching based on representations available or context familiarity. We discuss our findings and relate our results to those in the literature.

The physics department at Texas State University has implemented a Learning Assistant (LA) program with reform-based instructional changes in our introductory course sequences. We are interested in how participation in the program influences LAs' identity both as physics students and as physics teachers; in particular, how being part of the LA community changes participants' self-concepts and their day-to-day practice. We analyze written artifacts from program applications, reflections, evaluations, and group activities, as well as video of interviews with returning LAs. Our analysis suggests that engagement in the LA program increases LAs' sense of competence both in physics content and in the practice of engaging in the physics community. LAs change their perceptions of what constitutes competence: they learn to value and enjoy the practice of interactive, logical exploration and argumentation, which re-purposes being wrong (or saying wrong things) from a form of incompetence to an important component of competent engagement.

We are studying in how participation in the Learning Assistant program at Texas State University influences LAs' identity as physics students and physics teachers; in particular, how being part of the LA community changes participants' self-concepts and their day-to-day practice. Our analysis of self-concepts is informed by the identity framework developed by Hazari et al. [1, 2], and our analysis of practice is informed by Lave and Wenger's theory of Communities of Practice [3, 4]. We have developed a blended theory in order to analyze and explain LA program impact. We find that LAs expand their repertoire both of what they know how to do and of what they see as valuable in physics, consistent with Wenger's characterization of identity as community membership; and that recognition by faculty and peers supports LAs' continuing engagement, consistent with Wenger's characterization of identity as negotiated experience. We provide examples from our data.

A decade ago, web-based online homework was still somewhat of a novelty for many instructors; today it's a standard fixture in the introductory physics course. As online homework usage has grown, the ways in which students interact with this resource have changed.

In recent years there has been increased interest in understanding the ontological metaphors in play in experts' and novices' reasoning about energy. By ontological metaphors we mean metaphors that indicate what kind of a thing energy is. These metaphors include energy as a substance ("This object has a lot of energy") and energy as a vertical location ("It dropped down to a lower energy"). We are investigating how experts and novices might (or might not) coordinate and/or blend these two metaphors when reasoning about energy. In this talk, we will focus on how to use gestures to understand such ontological blending.

Our research team has been engaged in the iterative redesign of an introductory physics course for life science (IPLS) majors to explicitly bridge biology and physics in ways that are authentic to the disciplines. In our efforts to transform the IPLS course, we draw on the work of others who have argued that high-quality science instruction recognizes, leverages, and cultivates the productive beginnings of scientific inquiry in students' science reasoning by engaging students in making sense of phenomena, building and refining models, and generating satisfying explanations. It is unclear however what this learning process should look like at the college level as students also build from and refine more formal disciplinary knowledge that they have developed across their academic careers. Reflecting on our successes and failures in developing this course, we will present our best articulation of what educators should attend to in designing such interdisciplinary courses.

Life science students crave coherence among the science courses that they are required to take, and are frustrated when these courses fail to talk to each other in meaningful ways. In an effort to bridge disciplinary divides, we have iteratively designed and implemented an Introductory Physics for Life Scientists (IPLS) course that aims to unpack the physical mechanisms underlying a number of authentic biological phenomena. We draw on case-study data to examine what it looks like for students in our course to make connections between fundamental physical principles and meaningful biological questions. In particular, we explore the multiple ways in which an explanation can be "mechanistic" in the context of interdisciplinary sense making, and the affective markers that indicate satisfactory explanation. We argue that achieving explanatory coherence in an IPLS course demands that we take up authentic biological phenomena for which highly detailed accounts are not practical.

We present the results of two surveys carried out on a "Physics for Humanities" class of about a hundred students. The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) is used to measure the shift in attitudes via a pre- and post-test carried out in the second installation of this class. Post-test data from the first installation of the course is also presented. The second survey is course specific and seeks to correlate aspects of the CLASS survey with student feedback about the pedagogical approaches used in the course. We seek to understand the efficacy of the various pedagogical tools used in achieving the learning goals. Further, the outcomes could potentially inform future versions of this class, and add to the data about physics courses for non-science majors.

Web-based computer simulations (sims) are widely used as teaching tools in the physics education community, though few controlled studies attest to if and how the sims actually contribute to learning. This paper describes a comprehensive experiment where several class sections of undergraduate students demonstrate highly significant achievement in mental model formation and long-term recall after working with sims. Four physics topics are targeted in a core undergraduate Physics I course at the U.S. Military Academy. Prominent student misconceptions in these topics are identified, and useful computer simulations for covering these topics are described in detail. The learning metrics of correct mental models and long-term recall are assessed quantitatively with a large control group, and qualitative student feedback is also provided. Possible causation of sims' success rate is explored and limitations of both this study, and sims' contribution to learning are noted.

The Test of Understanding Graphs in Kinematics (TUG-K) is a multiple-choice test developed by Beichner in 1994 to assess students' understanding of kinematics graphs. Many of the items on the TUG-K have strong distractor choices which correspond to students' common difficulties with kinematics graphs. We evaluate one aspect of the pedagogical content knowledge of first-year physics graduate students enrolled in a teaching assistant (TA) training course related to topics covered in the TUG-K. In particular, for each item on the TUG-K, the graduate students were asked to identify which incorrect answer choice they thought would be most commonly selected by introductory physics students if they did not know the correct answer after instruction in relevant concepts. We used the graduate student data and the data from Beichner's original paper for introductory physics students (which was collected from over 500 college and high-school students) to assess this aspect of the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of the graduate students, i.e., knowledge of student difficulties related to kinematics graphs as they are revealed by the TUG-K. We find that, although the graduate students, on average, performed better than random guessing at identifying introductory student difficulties on the TUG-K, they did not identify many common difficulties that introductory students have with graphs in kinematics. In addition, we find that the ability of graduate students to identify the difficulties of introductory students is context dependent and that discussions among the graduate students improved their understanding of student difficulties related to kinematics graphs. Moreover, we find that the ability of American graduate students in identifying common student difficulties is comparable with that of foreign graduate students.

We are developing and assessing a quantum interactive learning tutorial (QuILT) on Mach Zehnder Interferometry with single photons to expose students to contemporary applications of quantum mechanics. The QuILT strives to help students develop the ability to apply quantum principles in physical situations, explore differences between classical and quantum ideas, and organize knowledge hierarchically. The QuILT also helps students learn about delayed choice experiments, first proposed by John Wheeler. It adapts visualization tools to help students build physical intuition about non-intuitive quantum phenomena and focuses on helping them integrate qualitative and quantitative understanding and discriminate between concepts that are often confused. Details of the development and assessment will be discussed. We thank the National Science Foundation for support.

In recent years, science and particularly physics education has been furthered by the use of project-based interactive learning. There is a tremendous amount of evidence that use of these techniques in a college learning environment leads to a deeper appreciation and understanding of fundamental concepts. Since vectors are the basis for any advancement in physics and engineering courses the cornerstone of any physics regimen is a concrete and comprehensive introduction to vectors. Here, we introduce a new turn-based vector game that we have developed to help supplement traditional vector learning practices, which allows students to be creative, work together as a team, and accomplish a goal through the understanding of basic vector concepts. The results of student retention of concepts has increased dramatically, and engagement and time spent in lab have been amazingly increased. The disguise of the lesson and impact of a competitive game environment will be discussed.

A constant struggle for professors is getting students to read the textbook. This year, I piloted a reading companion called an Active Reading Document (ARD). The goal of the ARD is for students to condense the important information from a chapter into one clear, well organized document. The ARD consists of three parts: a visual representation (for example, a concept map) of the content and connections within the chapter, a list of important terms with original definitions, and a set of original connections from within the chapter, to previous chapters, to their own life. This presentation will introduce the concept of an ARD and discuss the successes and failures in a first attempt of implementation into a physics course.

We have implemented web-based computer coaches into small classes at University of Minnesota Rochester over the last three years. The varying usage of coaches by individual students outside of class allowed us to categorize them into different user groups. This presentation reports on a comparative study on examining if and how different user groups' attitude toward problem solving changes after the completion of an introductory-level physics course as measured by an attitude survey. The relationship between the use of the coaches and students' conceptual learning measured by a concept test will also be discussed. A consistent tendency has been found correlating the user groups with their course performance and gender. Likewise, time of completion of the coaches seems to correspond with individual student attitudes toward problem solving as well as conceptual learning.

Research has shown that using visual cues and correctness feedback can improve problem solving. In this study, we investigate the effect of self-explanations as well as visual cues and correctness feedback on conceptual physics tasks. Students enrolled in an introductory mechanics course were interviewed individually and asked to provide self-explanations on conceptual physics tasks. Participants worked through four sets of tasks, each containing a diagram. Each set contained an initial task, six isomorphic training tasks, a near transfer task, and a far transfer task. Students in the cued conditions saw visual cues on the training tasks, and students in the feedback conditions were told whether their responses were correct or incorrect. We discuss the influence of self-explanation on students' ability to solve the training and transfer task with respect to the cue and feedback conditions.

Included conceptions were collected both from prior studies involving subjects having a variety of ages, and from our own interviews and assessments given to college students.

Our previous study shows visual cueing with feedback can be very helpful to students in physics problem solving. Effective linguistic cueing is an obvious complement of visual cueing in computer-aided instruction. In this study, we focus on the effects of verbal cueing and the interaction between linguistic cueing and visual cueing on correctness of students' responses on conceptual physics tasks. Participants solved four sets of conceptual problems, each of them containing one initial problem, six training problems, one near transfer problem, and one far transfer problem. Their spoken answers were analyzed for their reasoning and correctness. Our study provided insights into the relationship between the modality of cueing and students' physics problem solving performance. *This research is supported in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grants 1138697 and 1348857.

Potential energy is a conceptually rich topic presenting many difficulties for students. One key feature of potential energy is that it is a function of the distance between interacting objects. This concept is relevant to understanding potential energy in both physical and chemical contexts. Data from student responses to written surveys and small-group interviews reveal that students do not spontaneously make connections between ideas they have about energy from physics classes and the ideas necessary for an understanding of energy in chemical contexts, but that they can be guided to draw these connections with appropriate scaffolding. In this talk, I will describe research into the levels of scaffolding that are necessary and sufficient to aid students in drawing connections between energy concepts across the disciplines.

The Quantum Mechanics Concept Assessment (QMCA) is a 31-item multiple choice (MC) concept assessment instrument for first semester upper-division quantum mechanics. The process of developing this tool started with converting a preliminary version of an existing 14-item open-ended test to a MC format. During two years of testing and refinement, the QMCA has been given in alpha (N=61) and beta versions (N=263) to students in upper division quantum mechanics courses at 11 different institutions with average posttest score of 54%. In this talk, we will discuss the construction process of effective distractors and the use of student interviews and expert feedback to revise and validate both questions and distractors. We will also discuss the results of common statistical tests of reliability and validity, which suggest the instrument is presently in a stable, usable, and promising form.

Data that measures group learning are time-consuming to collect and analyze on a large scale. As an initial step toward scaling qualitative classroom observation, our team qualitatively coded classroom video using an established coding scheme with and without its audio. We find that inter-rater reliability is as high when using visual data only "without audio" as when using both visual and audio data to code. Also, inter-rater reliability is high even when comparing use of visual and audio data to visual-only data. We see a small bias that interactions are more often coded as group discussion when visual and audio data are used compared with video-only data. This work establishes that meaningful educational observation can be made through visual information alone. Further, after initial work from qualitative researchers validates the coding scheme in each classroom environment, computer-automated visual coding could drastically increase the breadth of qualitative studies and provide meaningful educational assessment to a large number of classrooms.

Student attitudes about learning and understanding physics have been shown to be nave and remarkably stable, failing to become more expert-like even after instruction informed by PER. This talk describes the efforts of one community college faculty member, already committed to and experienced with student-centered methods, to integrate explicit instruction in metacognition into her teaching of the introductory mechanics course. Students had weekly practice reflecting in writing on changes in their own thinking, supported by frequent full-class discussion in which this type of metacognition was modeled and framed. The sophistication of student attitudes about the role of reflection in their learning was tracked through an end-of-course learning commentary assignment. Preliminary analysis indicates substantial positive changes in attitudes as compared to results from sections of the course in which metacognition was not explicitly taught. The instruction will be briefly described, and data from multiple sections of the course will be shared. This work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.

But how accurately can students identify specific changes in their understanding? As part of a collaborative effort at WWU, WCC, NDSU, and U. Maine, we have examined student metacognition using paired questions. This talk presents results from a mechanics question administered at the beginning of instruction in a course for preservice elementary teachers, and again two weeks later toward the end of relevant instruction. The re-assessment included a prompt asking students to describe how their thinking had changed. Researchers coded responses on the initial assessment and re-assessment for content accuracy, and then compared differences in these codes to the students' self-reported descriptions of changes in their thinking.

Many universities have created programs to support undergraduate retention by placing students in research positions. I will present research on first-year undergraduate students' evolving ideas about physics research. Students in the study were part of a research seminar at the University of Maryland in which they worked with research mentors on research projects. Class time was dedicated to teaching research skills and supporting students through emotional hurdles associated with research. In classroom video and interviews, students described ways in which their research experiences were different from their expectations. Students tie an improved sense of competence in research to a better understanding of who does physics and how physics research works.

Recent publications have indicated that there is a link between students' performance and students' beliefs in whether intelligence is fixed or capable of growth. They also argue that these beliefs can be changed by simple interventions. In this talk, we will provide pre- and post-course evaluations of students' beliefs on intelligence using the Implicit Theory of Intelligence Scale (ITIS) for both an experimental and a control class. The experimental class had both a brief written and oral intervention. We will also show correlations between students' beliefs on intelligence and their success in the course.

As part of an ongoing project aimed at improving student learning by investigating and supporting student metacognitive abilities in the context of physics, we have been examining the role of metacognition in the kind of qualitative, inferential reasoning emphasized in research-based instructional materials. In particular, we have been using paired question sequences shown to elicit inconsistencies in student reasoning as the basis for a think-aloud interview protocol in which pairs of students collaboratively work through such question sequences. Audio, video, and real-time writing data have been used to identify instances of socially mediated metacognition. This talk will focus on targeted interventions in which student pairs are guided to reflect on multiple samples of authentic student work after the pairs have completed the problems collaboratively. Preliminary findings will be presented. This work is supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. DUE-1245313, DUE-1245999, and DUE-0962805.

At our institution, all freshmen are required to take a multidisciplinary course taught by three faculty members from different departments. Anecdotally, faculty members have long discussed the variations in student perceptions of the disciplines and how they are manifested in this context. This study presents pre- and post-data gathered from one such interdisciplinary class to determine whether there are measurable differences in the way students view natural science, social science, and humanities.

The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program was initially authorized in 2002. SUNY Buffalo State initially received Noyce funding in 2004. There have been approximately 40 scholars in Phase 1 and 26 scholars in Phase 2. Fifteen of these scholars were physics concentrations. Of these 15, four scholars are currently teaching physics or physical science in New York state. Another six scholars are currently in education, but not necessarily teaching physics or are not in the New York area. Of the remaining scholars, two have not yet completed the program. The selected Noyce physics scholars were observed, in the spring of 2015 semester, using the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP). Each scholar was observed several times; the observations were pre-arranged with paired observers. The resulting scores, with sub-scores, will be reported along with inter-rater reliability data. This data is a sub-set of a larger study of Noyce Scholars at Buffalo State.

The American Physical Society released a 2014 statement calling on all university physics and astronomy departments to provide all undergraduate students with access to research experiences. In response to this call, we investigated the current status of access to undergraduate research at CU-Boulder, a large research institution where the number of undergraduate physics majors outnumber faculty by more than five to one. We created and administered two surveys within CU-Boulders Physics Department: one probed undergraduate students familiarity with and participation in research; the other probed faculty members experiences mentoring undergraduate researchers. We present results from these surveys about access to undergraduate research within CU-Boulders Physics Department.

Faculty professional development (PD) workshops are a primary mechanism used to increase the adoption and adaptation of research-based instructional strategies (RBIS). PD workshops draw in many physics and astronomy instructors and serve a critical role in changing instructional practices within our community. Our research focuses on two of the largest and longest-running workshops for faculty: the New Physics and Astronomy Faculty Workshop and the Center for Astronomy Education Teaching Excellence Workshop. We are developing a real-time professional development observation tool to document what happens during workshops. We reveal opportunities to improve these PD efforts through increased awareness of instructors experiences and prior knowledge. We assume that all instructors have some pedagogical ideas that align with education research results, their productive resources. We analyze interviews to demonstrate the nature of these resources and consider how different PD practices create different opportunities for instructors resources to be built on.

Courses in science/engineering ethics as well as research on students' developing sense of ethics often emphasize the micro-ethics of research, mentoring, and publications. Little research or instruction focuses on how future scientists/engineers understand the social, ethical, environmental, economic, and political impact of their scientific and technological contributions. Towards addressing this gap in literature, we are creating case-study accounts of how future scientists/engineers think about their responsibility towards the social impact of their contribution. The case studies draw from video-taped semi-structured interviews. Our preliminary analysis suggests that how some students construe a scientist's/engineer's responsibility depends not just on rationalistic moral reasoning and personal experiences, but on the particular issue at hand (weaponized drones versus bridges, for example), on their sense of self as a future engineer, views about what is engineering, sense of nationality, emotions, targets of empathy, and ideologies/narratives available to them through participation in the world at large.

TLE TeachLivE is a mixed-reality classroom that allows participants (typically K-12 pre-service or in-service teachers) to practice teaching with simulated students. Similar to a flight simulator for pilots, TeachLivE allows teachers to refine their skills without risk to real students, and to practice the same skills in the same instructional context several times. Here, we describe the use of TeachLive with a class of physics Learning Assistants (LAs). Each LA led a short discussion in the mixed-reality class, observed the other LAs lead discussions, and reflected with their teammates about the experience. After reflection, each LA re-taught the same discussion. Finally, LAs were asked to write about what they learned from their experience. We will focus on changes in their use of certain pedagogical skills, such as questioning, from their first to second interaction with the simulator as well as their reactions to the experiences.

The CSU S-STEM Program supported by the National Science Foundation seeks to increase the educational attainment of CSU students and encourage more students to think of themselves as scientists. Chemistry and physics majors in the S-STEM Program receive tuition support at CSU, engage in a summer program based on the University of California-Berkeley Compass Project, participate in early research experiences during their first year at CSU, and engage in a peer and faculty mentoring program. Students also receive funding to support travel to attend conferences and present research and explore graduate programs, teaching careers, and careers in scientific research. An emphasis on the development of community, in addition to academic and scientific support, are essential elements of the CSU S-STEM Program and build on the resources of our students who mainly come from neighborhoods on the southside of Chicago.

This presentation gives an overview of findings from the first four years of running a Learning Assistant (LA) program[1] at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). At UMCP, LAs have supported educational transformation efforts across 12 different science courses and engaged 22 different instructors in research-based educational practices. In assessing the impact of this program on LAs, we have replicated CU-Boulders finding that LAs conceptual understanding is improved through participation in the LA program (~10% average absolute gain on FMCE[2]) [3]. We are investigating the longitudinal impacts of the LA experience on LAs and how LA programs may be cultivating change agents. We find that many of our former LAs continue to be involved in some teaching and work to change how learning environments are structured. LAs also report that their experiences in the program were transformative for the ways that they thought about teaching and learning science.

FIU has implemented a three-pronged retention approach that aims to create connections between typically isolated PER-driven reformed elements namely, a Bridge summer program, reformed introductory STEM classes and the Learning Assistant Program. We identify impacts of the summer Bridge program on student performance, retention rate, academic progress and performance in mathematics courses by comparing to a similar group of FTIC (First-time-in-college) engineering freshmen who havent participated in the program. Bridge students had higher retention rates than all other FTIC Engineering students, higher average cumulative credit counts and GPA, and outperformed all other engineering students as determined by their overall GPA in their mathematics courses. While this effect is substantial, Propensity Score Genetic Matching shows no effect on cumulative GPA when covariates such as high school GPA and SAT Math scores are included in the matched group of non-participants. We discuss these results in light of the involvement of the cohorts in the other reformed efforts.

The physics department at Texas State University has had a Learning Assistant (LA) program in place for three years, supporting reform-based instructional changes in all sections of our introductory course sequence for majors. We are interested in how participation in the LA program influences LAs identity as physics students and instructors; we have previously reported trends in increased community involvement and a shift in experienced LAs concepts of what it means to be competent. Our interview data now include first-semester LAs, and we see a significant difference in physics identity development between these LAs and those with more experience. During their first semester, LAs seem to experience a state of unease with respect to teaching and learning. We explain this discomfort in terms of Piagetian disequilibrium around their conceptions of competence in teaching and learning, and examine evidence of their (re-)construction of identities of competence.

Research has shown that an Interactive-Learning-Environment (ILE) can be an effective learning environment for acquiring transferrable knowledge. Our research analyzed characteristics of students participation in an ILE and their teamwork learning ability, in different areas of two consecutive interactive learning physics classes that implemented the Investigative-Science-Learning-Environment (ISLE) curriculuma type of widely used ILE. We quantified students participation in two broad areas: in-class learning activities and class review sessions. To analyze teamwork learning ability, we gave students six problems to be solved in groups (group exams), using physics they had not yet learned. We then gave them six standard physics problems related to the group exams to solve individually. Our results show that the frequency with which students participate in on topic physics discussions while engaged in learning activities is only weakly associated with learning, but being off-topic and disengaged has a consistently significant negative relationship with learning and transfer.

Our research team, composed of four high school physics teachers and two pre-service teachers, believe scientific induction is valuable and critical to student learning. We are exploring at what point in the learning cycle students gain ideas that align with those of the scientific community, i.e. scientific principles. Eight high school physics teachers piloting the Physics and Everyday Thinking (PET) curriculum collected data about student ideas using short diagnostic assessments. These were administered at three points during the learning cycle: before students shared initial predictions, after students conducted laboratory activities, and after students engaged in whole class discussions and readings about the scientific principles. We will present initial findings about student learning gains during induction-type activities. Further analysis will help us capitalize on students content understanding gains during the PET learning cycle and allow us to tailor future lessons so our instructional moves leverage that portion of the lesson.

We developed and implemented a set of online essential skills tasks to help students achieve and retain a core level of mastery and fluency in basic skills necessary for their coursework. The task design is based on our research on student understanding and difficulties as well as three well-established cognitive principles: 1) spaced practice, to promote retention, 2) interleaved practice, to promote the ability to recognize when the learned skill is needed, and 3) mastery practice mastery practice, to promote a base level of performance. We report on training on a variety of skills with vector math. Students spent a relatively small amount of time, 10-20 minutes in practice each week, answering relevant questions online until a mastery level was achieved. Results indicate significant and often dramatic gains, with retention at least several weeks after the final practice session, including for less-prepared students.

Force, velocity, and acceleration represent an interesting set of physics concepts in that they are foundational and a persistent source of student difficulty even after instruction. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of different question formats combined with immediate feedback in training on this set of concepts, we have compared computer-based practice with natural language and multiple choice question formats for two different populations of introductory physics students. In addition to comparisons of student progress through the training, student performance is analyzed based on their responses to a previously validated force and motion assessment. Results from an introductory physics course (first semester mechanics) suggest that natural language format questions may provide advantages over their multiple choice counterparts. However, subsequent results in a different introductory physics course (second semester electromagnetism) show that this finding may only be true for less-prepared students and that further replication is necessary.

Microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) formats in non-traditional settings allow us to vary the timing of laboratory-type experiences within the course design. We have used a clinical study to investigate the role of MBL experiences, using the IOLab system, as a tool to introduce new physics topics to students. In the study, college students with little to no physics background were given both passive and active online MBL instruction in varying order. We will discuss the effects of the format and order of instruction on student conceptual learning and retention, as well as the implications of these results for future course design.

Educational Data Mining (EDM) is the process of finding learning patterns and to predict some results that can materialize in the learning procedure. These data can be engendered from students through evaluation tests, virtual or physical activities, and homework corresponding to most of the activities that students have to make out with their respective instructional design. In the present work we show the effects of applying EDM algorithms from the results obtaining of two active-learning experiments designed ad-hoc for the learning of Basic Electric Circuits Concepts in High School students. We examined the effects of using simulations as one active-learning methodology and the use of low-cost experiments in the classroom as the second active-learning methodology this let us to compare the effects of the learning sequences in each methodology and with the results we can re-design the learning sequence and adapting the best exercises of each instructional design.

Preliminary data will be presented that suggests that PBL methodologies in physics do in fact spur growth in these areas. Further evidence gathered from student reflections will be presented that support and validate this claim.

In our preparatory kinematics and dynamics course of about 500 students, we replaced traditional immediate feedback homework with mastery-style homework. This mastery mode required students to perfect a set of questions before moving on to the next level of increased difficulty, and implemented narrated animated solutions to provide instructional support, if necessary. Results, including class performance compared to previous years students and student behaviors, will be discussed.

Mastery style activities that included narrated animated solutions for instructional support were compared with immediate feedback activities similar to most online homework. In a clinical study, the mastery group attempted question sets in four levels, with animated solutions between each attempt, until mastery was achieved on each level. This combined elements of formative assessment, the worked example effect, and mastery learning. The homework group attempted questions with immediate feedback and unlimited tries. The two groups took a similar amount of time to complete the activity. The mastery group significantly outperformed the homework group on a free response post-test that required students to show their work in solving near and far transfer problems.

Throughout the past three years, Elaborative Interrogation, which has students read a passage from the text and respond to the prompt Why is this true? for a sentence from the passage, has been employed in an introductory algebra-based physics course at a large Northeastern university. Students in the course were asked to complete elaborative interrogation questions based on assigned readings as part of their homework each week. In this talk we will present data collected during this intervention that show a relation between student performance and improvement on the elaborative interrogation questions and their course exam scores. We will also discuss data from cognitive interviews conducted as students were responding to the interrogation questions that provide insights into what the students are doing as they are reading the text and answering the questions.

In recent years a number of online platforms have been developed to facilitate the creation of student-generated course content. One widely used system is PeerWise, which provides a space where students can create and share multiple-choice questions; answer and rate other students questions; and engage in discussion with their peers. These types of activities have long been recognized as being effective in increasing students engagement and enhancing the development of knowledge and understanding, critical thinking, and problem solving skills. As part of a wider study across courses in physics, chemistry, and biology, we present findings from a multi-year study of PeerWise use in early-years undergraduate physics courses. In the majority of courses there is a positive relationship between engaging with PeerWise and end of course exam performance, even when taking into account other influences on performance, such as students prior ability.

On the basis of our analysis of responses to written questions administered to large numbers of introductory physics students at several universities across the United States, we report the specific, recurring conceptual resources that students use to reason about energy. This work responds to a need for large-scale, resources-grounded research on students conceptual understanding and supports the development of an underexplored dimension of pedagogical content knowledge knowledge of student resources for understanding energy, in contrast to misconceptions or misunderstandings about energy. We aim to promote instructor take-up of the resources theory of knowledge, and we suggest a number of ways in which instructors might capitalize on the resources we report.

In this study, students ability to draw inferences from graphs was explored. Approximately 300 students, in either the first or second semester of an introductory, calculus-based physics course, were given simple two-dimensional graphs and asked to draw inferences about the relationship between the dependent variable and each of three independent variables shown in the graph. The common strategies students employed and the pitfalls they encountered in doing this were observed. Additionally, the effect of students prior belief on their ability to draw valid inferences was assessed by presenting graphs either in a familiar physical context or in a more generic context. We found students were generally able to read simple graphs; however, their ability was affected by the consistency of their prior beliefs with the data, their numeric ability, and the complexity of the graph. These results are consistent with previous studies done with data tables.

The DEAR-Faculty project is a large, international, multi-methods study to investigate student learning in introductory physics. As part of this project, we conduct meta-analyses of published data using popular research-based conceptual assessments such as the Force Concept Inventory (FCI). In this talk, I present a meta-analysis of student learning in electricity and magnetism. We concatenated data from a comprehensive literature search of papers published in PhysRevST-PER, AJP, and the PERC proceedings, and/or indexed in ERIC, Scopus, or Web of Science. We selected all primary studies that present sufficient data on the two most popular EM assessments: the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM), and the Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment (BEMA). Our data set includes 50 studies representing about 60 schools. We calculated the effects of institution and teaching methods on student learning, as well as some overall statistics on the heterogeneity of the data set.

Energy is a topic that spans the scientific disciplines. Many studies conducted within the domains of both physics and chemistry demonstrate that potential energy in particular is a difficult topic for students. Previous work has shown that even within physics, students do not necessarily draw on ideas from mechanics when answering questions about potential energy in the context of electrostatics. We have been engaged in a research project aimed at helping students to make productive use of their ideas about gravitational potential energy when asked questions in the context of electrostatics. In this talk, we will report on recent findings regarding what helps students to draw these connections. We will present data from small-group interviews and online surveys, and we will discuss the implications these data have for instruction on energy in introductory courses.

Learning quantum mechanics requires students to develop not only new mathematical skills but also conceptual understanding. Towards this instructional goal, the Modern Physics for Engineers course at the University of Colorado Boulder explicitly addresses interpretation of quantum phenomena. Research indicates that when instruction does not explicitly address student beliefs about the nature of a subject, the students ideas tend to become less expert-like (Atman, et al., 2007). We present new data from focus groups of students enrolled in this course. During recorded discussions, they negotiate the tension between reasoning about light in terms of classical (wave-like) and quantum (particle-like) ontologies. We examine transitions in students ontological reasoning about light as well as their use of energy as a bridge between classical and quantum ideas. Finally, we consider fostering students' metacognitive awareness as a route to expert-like behaviors in quantum mechanics.

The abstract nature of energy encourages the use of metaphorical language in educational settings. K-12 teachers and students use conceptual metaphors implicitly to express their ideas about what energy is or how it functions in particular scenarios. Attending to the use of conceptual metaphors in the classroom can expand teachers repertoire for formative assessment of student ideas. Yet science education research on analogies and metaphors has predominately focused on explicit, instructional analogies, rather than attending to such implicit, ubiquitous features of natural language in science. In a secondary science teacher professional development course, we observe teachers engage in an instructional activity designed to increase awareness of conceptual metaphor in everyday language and in descriptions of energy. These teachers come to value the application of conceptual metaphor in educational settings; they acknowledge that if they identify metaphors present in their students science language, they will better understand their students ideas about energy. We present possible mechanisms for teacher growth in learning and valuing the use of energy metaphors and illustrate how to support teachers in noticing, understanding, and valuing metaphors for energy.

Often in environments where students are collaboratively working on physics problems, students need to manage social conflict alongside grappling with conceptual and epistemological differences. At the University of Maryland, our PER group has been developing QM tutorials to help students more carefully navigate between classical and quantum models. In this presentation, we document several outlets that students use as tools for social framing and managing social conflict. These resources include epistemic distancing, humor, playing on tutorial wording and looking ahead to subsequent questions. Our data come from video-records of a focus group at the University of Maryland, where students work through a tutorial on the Particle in a Box. We see evidence of students using mathematics in ways that may normally be interpreted as indicating an epistemological stance, but are actually used as a means of defusing social tension.

Introductory university physics frequently involves the construction of integrals. There is evidence to suggest that a major obstacle to student success in the construction of physics integrals is an inability to formulate and interpret differentials and products involving differentials. We provided introductory calculus-based physics students with several physics problems featuring infinitesimal quantities in a variety of contexts in order to identify potential misconceptions regarding physical differentials. Our results demonstrated several broad, recurring student difficulties. To address these issues, we conducted a controlled experiment at the introductory level to help students practice the construction and explore the physical meaning of differentials. This between-students design featured pairs of similarly-styled training tasks that varied by physical context, either on paper without feedback or on a computer with electronic feedback. A post-test was given to all conditions. We will discuss and analyze the results of these studies.

In a study on student understanding of graphical representations of work, students in introductory calculus-based physics were presented with a force-position graph (F-x) that showed two different mechanical processes with identical initial and identical final values for force and position. The task, to compare the works done in each case, was administered at three points along the two-semester instructional sequence to probe differences in student responses and reasoning and compare findings to results from analogous questions in thermodynamics. Response prevalence varied little across administrations; however, the reasoning students used showed variation. Analysis of reasoning used showed a higher use of area under the curve for a correct response, and a more prevalent invocation of path independence or conservative forces for the major incorrect interpretation, with instruction. These findings support earlier speculation that thermodynamics students associate work with conservative forces due to introductory instruction.

As part of a larger project at the University of Maine to investigate the learning and teaching of concepts in thermodynamics and electronics that are integral to both undergraduate physics and engineering programs, we have been examining student learning in electrical engineering and physics courses on electric circuits and electronics. A major goal of this work at the physics-engineering interface is to probe the extent to which the nature of student understanding (including the prevalence of specific difficulties) depends upon the disciplinary context. In this talk, I will focus on our efforts to probe student understanding of basic diode circuits using free-response questions. Preliminary results from questions administered in both physics and engineering courses will be presented.

Through a classroom study, we investigated whether student attempts to invent general physics principles support both discovery and future learning of those principles. In introductory physics discussion sections, small groups of students used a PhET simulation to connect ideas from topographic contour maps to electric equipotential lines for two sample charge configurations. The goal was for students to find the relationship between the electric field and the equipotential lines. On a conceptual survey administered immediately after this activity, students directed to create general rules performed better than students led through case-by-case predictions. This differential was maintained some days later, after both groups had received instruction in lecture and lab on the topic. This indicates that the task of explicit generalization not only supports discovery of general physics principles, but also prepares students for improved future learning from instruction.

Developing physical intuition about quantum mechanics can seem like a departure from our everyday experience of the physical world, but we build new ideas from our existing ones. In this presentation we examine video data from a focus group doing a tutorial about the particle in a box. In reasoning about the properties of a quantum particle, the students bring in elements of a classical particle ontology, which are evident not only through the students language but through their use of gestures. But this is modulated by metacognitive moments in which the group explicitly takes up questions of whether classical intuitions are valid for the quantum system. Through this reflection, the students find some cases in which classical ideas can be usefully applied to quantum physics, and others in which they directly contrast classical and quantum mechanics. Negotiating this boundary is part of the process of building quantum intuitions.

A significant goal of STEM education research has been to understand how students solve problems. An important aspect of students approaches to problem solving is their epistemologies, or beliefs about knowledge. In this study, students in a calculus-based, introductory physics course were presented with a problem on a test that asked them to find the mass of a simple pendulum given its equation of motion. Later, students were asked to write a short reflection on their problem-solving strategies and feelings as they wrestled with the problem. Understandably, students were frustrated by their inability to obtain a numerical answer. Reflections and test answers give insight into the students beliefs about the complexity and source of knowledge. Results show that most students relied heavily on their equation sheets. However, frustration with that method led some to progress to other considerations including lab experiences and their own conceptual understanding.

Visual cues have been shown to direct attention to relevant areas of a diagram and facilitate problem solving. We investigate the effect of visual cues on students visual attention while solving conceptual physics problems with diagrams. The diagrams contained features relevant to correctly solving the problem, as well as features attributed to common incorrect answers. Students enrolled in an introductory mechanics course were individually interviewed using a think-aloud protocol while their eye movements were recorded. Participants worked through four sets of problems containing an initial problem, four isomorphic training problems, and two transfer problems. Students in the cued condition saw visual cues overlaid on the training problems. A second interview was conducted two weeks later, in which students solved the two transfer problems without cues. We compare the cued and non-cued groups with respect to the automaticity of extracting relevant information on the transfer and retention problems.

We present the preliminary results of a study of student use of representations in problem solving within the Modeling Instruction Electricity and Magnetism (MI-EM) course. Representational competence is a critical skill needed for students to develop a sophisticated understanding of and success in college science topics. In this study, 70 students were given a survey of 25 physics problem statements both pre- and post- instruction, covering both Newtonian Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism (EM), and asked which representations they would use in that given situation. We analyze the results by comparing the preponderance of these representations. We also compare student representation use for those who had already taken the first-semester Modeling Instruction Mechanics course and those students who had taken a non-Modeling Mechanics course. In addition, we look at how students representation use changed by context of problem (Mechanics vs. EM).

To create valuable hints in computer-assisted instruction for physics problems involving graphs and figures, the effect of hint modalities needs to be tested on students performance and visual attention. Participants in our study solved four sets of conceptual problems, each of them containing one initial problem, six training problems, one near transfer problem, and one far transfer problem. The data showed that the same content in different modalities alters the effectiveness of the hint. Students eye movement data has also been explored to give insight into how hint modality changes students visual attention and how multiple hint modalities interact with each other. The results of this study could shed light on generating new principles to guide construction of computer-based physics problem solving instruction.

Visual cueing is shown to be effective in helping students solve conceptual physics tasks. However, students may have difficulties in solving physics transfer tasks with different surface features. We investigated if instruction provided using videos that contain explanations to the tasks that will improve students performance in solving near and far tasks. We interviewed students using a think-aloud protocol. Each interview included four sets of tasks. In each set students need to solve one initial problem, four isomorphic training tasks, a near transfer task, and a far transfer task. Based on the conditions, some of the students were provided with visual cues when solving training tasks, and some of them were provided with an instructional video following the training session. We compare students reasoning patterns and correctness in the two conditions.

Previous studies have shown that visual cues can help students to shift their attention toward relevant features of the conceptual physics problems in graph representation. However cueing does not completely prohibit students from attending to irrelevant features of a problem. In this study with students in an algebra-based class, we investigated the role of cues based on Wickens proximity compatibility principle that enabled us to adapt cues to particular kinds of questions. This principle states that there is a competition between the proximity of display features and proximity between the information in the mental state of the participants. Further, based on the Gestalt laws of grouping, we manipulated the display design to investigate the influence of the display proximity on the organization of the students attention toward the relevant parts of a problem and how that affects their response time.

Improving students skills in solving synthesis problems, which are problems requiring the application of multiple concepts such as energy conservation and kinematics, is typically a key instructional goal. We have previously found that students struggle with synthesis problems more than their single-concept counterparts in part because of difficulty recognizing all the relevant concepts or that multiple concepts are needed. Here we report on an experiment designed to test the effects of different types of hints on helping students apply the necessary concepts in solving a problem combining energy conservation and centripetal acceleration. While we found no statistically significant differences between the effects of different hints, we discuss trends suggesting that discouraging common incorrect solution paths may be more effective than highlighting underused components of a correct solution.

The study explores the effects of incrementing the mathematical complexity of a synthesis problem on students ability to recognize the relevant concepts and appropriately apply the identified concepts. The task highlights the situation of a block propelled from a spring on an inclined ramp. It undergoes projectile motion and lands on another inclined surface. Three versions of the task with different mathematical complexity were designed, requesting for the horizontal distance traveled by the block, spring compression, and projection angle respectively. A cohort of 105 physics students in three groups completed one version of the problem. Across the three tasks, more than a half of the sample succeeded in recognizing the appropriate concepts and committed to using solely the identified concepts. However, regardless of the mathematical complexity level, the majority of the students failed to correctly apply the physics concepts, with the occurrence of similar types of conceptual mistakes.

Troubleshooting activities engage students in diagnosing/explaining embedded mistakes in teacher-made erroneous solutions for physics problems. We hypothesized that students engaged in troubleshooting activities (aided by principle-based prompts and sample diagnoses when reviewing their own diagnoses) would outperform students engaged in problem-solving activities (aided by sample solutions when reviewing their own solutions) in their preparation for future learning: understanding of the concepts required to solve these problems, as well as inclination to self-repair one's understanding when reviewing his/her work. We will describe the findings of a comparison between two groups of 10th graders from the Arab sector in Israel, one performing troubleshooting activities and the other problem-solving activities in the context of geometrical optics. We will present an analysis of students' articulations that manifest self-repair when reviewing their own work, aided by instructors' diagnosis of an erroneous solution as well as analysis of their performance on transfer problems.

We hypothesized that students engaged in troubleshooting activities (aided by principle-based prompts and sample diagnoses when reviewing their own diagnoses) would outperform students engaged in problem-solving activities (aided by sample solutions when reviewing their own solutions) in their preparation for future learning: understanding of the concepts required to solve these problems, as well as inclination to self-repair one's understanding when reviewing his/her work. We will describe the methodology used to examine this hypothesis, comparing two groups participating in online year-long interventions, a troubleshooting and a problem-solving intervention, both focused on the same problems. Students' performance before and after the interventions were examined using the double transfer methodology: Solving a transfer problem after studying a learning resource: instructors' diagnosis and correction of an erroneous solution to an isomorphic problem.

As physics instructors, we often scaffold problem solving by prompting students with a series of intermediate steps. The consequences, good or bad, of such scaffolding are often left uninvestigated. We report on results of a study partially replicating and extending research by Heckler (2009) in which we asked undergraduate students to solve Newtons laws problems. Half of the students were prompted to draw a force diagram before finding a solution. We found that the diagram prompt drove students away from an intuitive strategy, toward more lengthy formal strategies with lower success rates. In another measure, students were more likely to find fault with the informal nature of an intuitive solution if the problem statement included a diagram prompt. These results suggest that such problem-solving scaffolding affects students solution approach, possibly by cuing different epistemological stances on what counts as a good answer.

Well-designed instructional simulations in the classroom can help students learn difficult concepts in an enjoyable way. The University of Colorado PhET simulations are some of the most widely used (15 million runs every year). We are investigating students' reasoning when working collaboratively on PhET simulations scaffolded by tutorial worksheets. We have developed a tutorial for the Gas Properties simulation for introductory physics students designed to solicit mechanistic reasoning about temperature and pressure in terms of molecular motion. However, in clinical and classroom settings, students working collaboratively on the tutorial used the ideal gas law to make predictions about situations in which an ideal gas is being compressed or heated and subsequently used the simulation to confirm their predictions. Many groups did not engage in discussing the temperature, pressure or work done in terms of the molecular motion. These results informed subsequent modifications. We will present preliminary results of our investigations.

As part of a larger study on physics identity development, we have observed that students link their academic achievements and social interactions in physics to their sense of belonging in physics. For students who identify with underrepresented groups in physics, stereotype threats can be a significant obstacle to feeling like a physicist because students belong to multiple communities with identities that are often at odds with one another. As representatives of their community, these students have to deal with the added worry of confirming the stereotypes about their group. For example, female majors may feel that they have to prove that women arent bad at math. Through interviews with upper-division physics majors, we examined coping strategies to deal with stereotype threat in a variety of settings. Our findings suggest that peers and mentors can play unexpected roles in helping students manage stereotype threat and succeed in becoming physicists.

Swarthmore College life science students take a traditional first semester physics course, but have the option of taking an innovative Introductory Physics for the Life Sciences (IPLS) course in the second semester. This curricular structure presents a unique opportunity to compare students experiences across these different instructional environments. We have used multiple conceptual and attitudinal survey instruments, and have interviewed a number of students over the course of the year, in an effort to assess students evolving relationship with physics across these two different experiences. In this talk we present some of our findings from these survey and interview data, comparing epistemological and affective features of students experiences across the traditional and IPLS environments. This comparison allows us to identify some of the features that students find especially engaging about the IPLS course in particular.

Effectively teaching an Introductory Physics for the Life Sciences (IPLS) course means engaging life science students in a subject for which they may not have considerable preexisting interest. We have found that the inclusion of authentic life science examples supports students whose initial interest in physics is less developed, but that different examples and models vary in their effectiveness at engaging student interest. In this talk we begin to unpack this variability, exploring why some life science examples may be more successful than others at sparking and sustaining student interest. By analyzing data from (1) survey instruments assessing student interest in particular life science examples, and (2) interviews conducted with students before and after instruction, we identify features of our IPLS course that appear to be particularly important for fostering student engagement. We suggest that some of these features might also foster student interest in more traditional introductory physics courses.

While many instructors are interested in implementing student-centered practices in their classroom, few have access to data from their classroom to make informed instructional decisions. Our research team has developed the Student Participation Observation Tool (SPOT), an innovative web-based application, developed based on observable classroom actions aligned with research-based instructional practices. Using the SPOT, observers collect observational data that can be used by instructors to identify desirable classroom interaction sequences as well as illuminate areas for possible improvement. Armed with data, instructors are able to make informed decisions about their teaching practice and implement desired changes aligned with research-based best practices. This presentation describes the methods used to identify research about best practices in teaching as well as the process of distilling the observable actions and modes of engagement included in SPOT. We will also discuss how session participants can access the SPOT in order to try it out.

Undergraduate research has been recognized as a significant way to facilitate undergraduate students more central participation in physics. In this talk, I will present a potential mechanism by which research experiences may impact undergraduate participation: changes in their beliefs about the nature of science coupled to changes in a sense of ability to contribute to authentic research. Students in the study were part of a research seminar at the University of Maryland in which they worked with faculty and graduate student research mentors on research projects. Class time was dedicated to developing research skills and supporting students through emotional hurdles associated with research. In videotaped interviews, we asked students to describe their experiences in research. Students developed nuanced views about how the research process works. They also perceive shifts in their sense of access to research, feeling like their contributions as novices mattered.

Educational psychology studies have linked self-belief constructs to success in STEM, including self-efficacy (the belief in ones ability to succeed at specific tasks) and growth mindset (seeing intelligence as something that can be developed through dedication and effort). However, most of the work with these constructs uses traditional psychology large-N quantitative studies that show that change happens without describing in qualitative detail the mechanism by which it happens. This presentation will focus on a likely place for students to have a self-efficacy and growth mindset building experience: an in-depth course project that students complete in conjunction with introductory physics. We present evidence of students who see themselves as competent in neuroscience or genetics, who identify as people who embrace challenge, but who still place physics in a category of special difficulty. We then explore how this overlapping interests project creates opportunities to impact self-efficacy and growth mindset in physics.

Psychological research about human memory has shown the effectiveness of spaced recall.(1) This research has demonstrated that attempting to recall information leads to stronger memory, than being told of rereading the information. In this talk I will describe how I have tried to incorporate spaced recall in my classes, and the ways it aids me as an instructor to make pedagogical decisions. I will also speculate on the cognitive skills that may aid student recall.

In consecutive semesters, students from a second-semester introductory college physics course have been asked to report who they worked with on physics outside class time. In the first semester, the course was taught in a traditional lecture class setting. In the second semester the course was taught by the same instructor with similar class size, implementing aspects of Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) where students worked collaboratively in group learning activities. Our study suggests that implementing an in-class interactive learning environment can help foster the informal learning community outside of the classroom. Using social network analysis, we have analyzed the relationship between students positions in the informal learning communities formed outside the classroom with their performance in the course. Our results indicate that being integrated into the informal learning community outside of the classroom can help students, especially weaker ones, to succeed in their introductory physics courses.

Although the number of students earning bachelors degrees in physics has increased, the percentage of those degrees earned by women has not increased for more than 10 years. We use a physics identity framework to understand the factors that may impact physics career choice. Physics identity consists of three dimensions: recognition (perception of recognition by others), interest (desire to learn more), and performance/competence (perception of ability to understand). Our previous work has shown that recognition and interest are more significant predictors of physics career choice than performance/competence, and that women may require more recognition than men in order to choose physics careers. Therefore, teaching strategies that specifically target recognition and interest should be identified. Using data from a survey administered to a nationally representative sample of college students, we use regression models to determine which teaching strategies predict recognition and which strategies predict interest.

Students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds in the United States face unique challenges across the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields, but the situation in physics is especially concerning: of all the physics bachelor degrees awarded nationwide, only 4% go to Hispanic students. This problematic level of participation can be investigated through the construct of physics identity, or how strongly a student feels like a physics person, which has been shown to be correlated with the likelihood of choosing a physics career. Because physics identity may be impacted by a students social interactions, Network Analysis may be used to explore the relationship between a students calculated centrality a measure of how embedded or central a particular student is within the classroom social network and their physics identity. In this study, we investigate this relationship for students in a collaborative-learning Modeling Instruction introductory physics course at Florida International University.

The Physics and Astronomy Department at Michigan State University recently began to redesign its introductory physics courses. At the center of this transformation effort is an attempt to include scientific practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas in the assessments and instruction of the courses. As part of a research effort, we have been developing the Three-Dimensional Learning Assessment Protocol (3D-LAP) to characterize how assessments used in introductory courses change over time. This instrument provides criteria by which scientific practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas can be identified within assessment items. Additionally, this instrument can be used to help write new assessment items or improve existing ones. This presentation will focus on the 3D-LAP and using it to track changes in assessments over time as well as to build assessment items that incorporate all three dimensions.

The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) has become a standard instrument for assessing changes in student attitudes. The standard data analysis protocol compares student responses to those of experts, and assigns a percentage ranking to each respondent. This analysis assumes students fall on a continuum from novice to expert. Another analysis model, the Rasch Model, is also based on this assumption. The Rasch Model also provides information about survey items simultaneously with information about respondents. For this reason, the Rasch Model provides an alternate, and perhaps more robust, method of analyzing CLASS data. To compare the Rasch Model to the traditional analysis methods, we have applied the Rasch Model to data that had been previously analyzed using the protocol developed at the University of Colorado. We will present the results of the Rasch Analysis, and discuss the differences between it and the standard analysis.

In previous research we have shown that novice physics students distinguish between the concept of a net vector quantity and the concept of a total vector quantity. Introductory physics textbooks variably use the terms net, total or resultant when referring to a vector sum, with some textbooks using these terms interchangeably. In particular, we have shown that students distinguish between the concepts of net force and total force, and the concepts of net momentum and total momentum. Phase two of this research has been to analyse the reasons students give for making these distinctions. Using an approach suggested by Grounded Theory, free responses from 400 freshmen have been analyzed and broad reasoning trends have been identified. These trends are contrasted with foundational representational schemas posited by the cognitive sciences, such as changing position versus changing state, and interior viewpoint versus exterior viewpoint.

Constructed response questions (short-answer, open-ended items) have the potential to provide more insight on student thinking than the multiple choice questions often employed in large introductory STEM courses. However, the time and costs associated with the evaluation and analysis of large data sets of constructed response has traditionally been a barrier to their adoption. In an effort to provide instructors with greater insight into their student understanding of core STEM concepts the Automated Analysis of Constructed Response (AACR, www.msu.edu/~aacr) Research Group is working to create a system for the automated analysis of student constructed responses. In this presentation we present recent work developing constructed response items to evaluate students understanding of foundational concepts in physics and astronomy, and discuss preliminary results produced by these items.

The Force Concept Inventory (FCI) has become a world standard as an instrument to measure students conceptual understanding of Mechanics. In particular, the Normalized Gain has proven to be a robust measure of the effect of pedagogy upon student learning. While the original FCI was developed in English, translations have been made. In this study seeks to determine the effect, if any, of administering the FCI in different languages to different groups of students, taken from the same student population. As an English language university in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Alfaisal University is an excellent laboratory for such a study. The FCI has been administered to all introductory physics students at Alfaisal, at the beginning and the end of the first physics course spring 2015 semester. The students were randomly assigned English and Arabic administrations. Results for the first semester of this study will be presented along with preliminary analysis.

There is a split in teaching the concepts of weight and gravitation in physics education (Galili, 2001). One group of physics teaches weight as the gravitational force within the developed Newtonian framework (e.g. Young and Freedman, 2012). The second group adopts the modern framework based on the operational definition of weight (e.g. Knight, 2013). Normally the authors in each group ignore the other view. We suggest teaching weight within the cultural perspective (Galili, 2012) which displays the two options and argues for the modern one the operationally defined weight which does not coincide with the gravitational force. We have performed a comprehensive study on this subject (Stein, 2012) which included teaching experiments in which we applied a constructivist dialogical teaching of the topic of Weight-Gravitation. Our findings showed the ability of students to distinguish between weight and gravitation and meaningfully understand these concepts (Stein & Galili, 2014).

We present an experiment in which subjects with differing levels of physics experience were timed in their ability to detect small changes in nearly identical pairs of diagrams that are representative of typical introductory physics situations. It was hypothesized that higher physics expertise would guide attention and result in faster detection times for those changes that affected the physics, whereas no expertise advantage in detection times would result for changes that did not affect the physics. Our findings partially confirmed the hypothesis. We present results on how the response time for noticing physics-relevant changes in the diagram pairs is faster than for physics-irrelevant changes for those with more extensive physics experience and slower for those with less extensive physics experience. We discuss the cognitive implications of our findings.

As part of a broader study aimed at understanding the first-year laboratory experience from various perspectives, we report on a pilot study in which we probed students perceptions of the first-year lab course at the end of the first term. For this purpose we developed a written instrument comprising five questions regarding the following areas of interest: expectations, enjoyment, learning, relation to course content, and assessment. Each question on the instrument is framed as a debate in which different points of view were posited. The respondents were requested to choose the view with which they most closely agreed (forced choice response), and more importantly, were directed to explain their choice in detail (free response writing). We detail the analysis and report on some of the preliminary findings focusing on the aspects of enjoyment and the learning experience

Testwiseness is generally defined as the set of cognitive strategies used by a student and intended to improve their score on a test regardless of the tests subject matter. To improve our understanding of the potential effect size of several well documented elements of testwiseness, we analyze student performance on questions present in the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) that contain distractors, the selection of which can be related to the use of testwiseness strategies. We further examine the effects of both the positive and potential negative effects of testwiseness on student scores by developing two modified versions of the FCI designed to include additional elements related to testwiseness. Details of the development of the modified versions of the FCI and the effect sizes measured in all versions of the FCI will be discussed.

Research over several decades has shown that active self-monitoring is characteristic of expert learners. More recent studies have examined student metacognition in introductory physics contexts. As part of a multi-institutional collaborative effort, we have been investigating reflective metacognition student ability to describe in hindsight what they have learned about a specific physics concept, and how they have learned it. We are interested in how student descriptions of their own learning compare with how instructors might evaluate their learning. Our methodology involves matched written assessment questions given at the start and end of a learning episode. After the post-test, students reflect on how their thinking has changed. Comparison of self-reported and researcher-characterized changes allows the accuracy of student reflections to be examined. The study design was described in a presentation at the Winter 2015 AAPT meeting in San Diego; the current talk shares preliminary results.

Already in 1630 we find an author noting that learners are liable to respond "by rote, as parrots." If we would avoid this in our teaching, we should imitate the method of questioning used by Socrates: "Some dialogues in Plato were worth the reading, where the singular dexterity of Socrates in this kind may be observed and imitated." The author is George Herbert, the work is "A Priest to the Temple: the Country Parson, His Character, and rule of Holy Life", and the activity at hand is catechizing the faithful. I am fascinated that Herbert addresses an issue still important to contemporary reformers of Physics education, using the same words. In this brief talk I try to establish analogues between ecclesiastical educational practices in 1630 England and contemporary USA, and translate Herbert's advice for reform into terms suitable for the training of physics teachers.

The medical degree at the University of Cape Town is a six-year undergraduate degree, including a one semester physics course (PHY1025) during the first year. In previous years students have often expressed negative sentiments toward the laboratory component of the course in which a fairly rigorous approach to measurement had been adopted viewing it as disconnected from the theory or simply as irrelevant to their medical training. This has led to revising the laboratory curriculum, focusing on two goals (1) improving the connection between lab and lectures and (2) highlighting skills that are relevant for a future as a medical doctor. As part of the evaluation of the new labs (being piloted for the first time) we are using E-CLASS to measure student attitude at the start (February) and the end of the course (May). We briefly describe the new laboratory curriculum and then present our results.

While the STEM education community has developed many new pedagogies and materials, not many have been successful in reaching a wide audience. This study is part of a larger effort to understand how new pedagogies and materials can become widely used, by learning more about those that have become well-propagated. Experts across STEM disciplines were asked to identify well-propagated instructional strategies and materials in their disciplines. We created a categorization scheme for the strategies and materials and gathered evidence to evaluate the extent to which the innovations they suggested had propagated. This presentation will discuss the general characteristics of well-propagated instructional strategies and materials. Most have been funded by multiple grants over time and emphasize changes in approaches to instruction, not changes to content. Further, their propagation strategies were adapted to the resources and degree of collaboration with colleagues required by the instructional strategy.

To provide opportunities for students to engage meaningfully with core disciplinary concepts and practices in physics, an introductory calculus-based mechanics course was designed so that students collaborated in small groups to solve complex story problems. Our research focuses on how collaboration between group members affects their opportunities to learn and do physics. Qualitative methods were used to analyze video-recorded small group discussions over a three-week period. The dynamics of the social interactions between group members were analyzed through positioning theory (Davies & Harr, 1990). Preliminary findings indicate that group members seemed to position themselves as capable of doing physics. Additionally, each group member was positioned by his or her peers and/or instructor as either more or less knowledgeable in doing physics. As a work in progress, we report on how students negotiate these positionings from multiple sources.

Successful pedagogical change in an institution is often built on a foundation of prior efforts and can have a non-linear trajectory. North Carolina State Universitys Student-Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies (SCALE-UP) is a studio-style instructional approach that modifies the classroom structure and pedagogy to promote interaction. There can be challenges when adopting this radical reform, which reconceptualizes the role of teacher and student in a novel learning environment. Using case studies of SCALE-UP secondary implementers, we explore the beginnings of SCALE-UP within departments in a variety of institutions and STEM disciplines. We examine the context of these departments and institutions prior to SCALE-UP, the key players who drive the change, and the events and strategies that lead to implementation. This talk notes commonalities and differences that occurred in successful SCALE-UP implementations. Does successful educational change follow a strategic plan or does serendipity play a significant role?

I will report on two years of results of a study designed to measure the effectiveness of an instructional strategy known as two-stage exams or collaborative group exams. This exam format first has the students take the exam individually. Once all the students have handed in their individual exams, they organize into collaborative groups of three or four and take the same exam again with only a single copy of the exam being given to each group. Different versions of the group exam feature different subsets of the questions from the individual exam. Questions isomorphic to the exam questions were administered on the end-of-course diagnostic and comparisons, using the relevant isomorphic question, are made between the students that saw a given question on the group exam and those that did not.

Andragogy is the "art and science" of teaching adults. Is it necessary to distinguish between Pedagogy and Andragogy when modeling learning experiences specifically for the adult learner? The EMPACTS (Educationally Managed Projects Advancing Curriculum, Technology and Service) project-based learning model was developed specifically for the unique needs of the adult learner. Courses that employ the EMPACTS delivery system, use the EMPACTS project to enhance the learning of course content as adult learners transition from a socialized "passive" learning experience to one of "active," self-directed ownership in the process. Pedagogical frameworks are historically designed for K-12 learners who need structure, direction and greater facilitation in the learning process. Adult learners learn best if they are allowed to use their own knowledge and life experiences as they apply specific course content to real world problems. The EMPACTS model encourages collaboration and the use of technology as adult learners design and complete semester long projects.

As part of a project to explore successful strategies for using studio methods, such as SCALE-UP, we explore self-regulatory abilities and learning approaches of students in said courses at three universities with varying student populations and differing success in studio-mode courses. We survey students using compiled questions from several existing surveys designed to measure student characteristics such as attitudes toward and motivations for learning, organization of scientific knowledge, experiences outside the classroom, and demographics. Here, we utilize clustering methods to group students into learning profiles to better understand the study strategies and motives of algebra-based studio physics students. We present results from first-semester and second-semester studio-mode introductory physics courses across three universities, totaling 11 classrooms with 10 different instructors. We identify several distinct learning profiles and evaluate demographic and concept inventory performance differences between them.

Modeling how students think about physics is often measured via observation of students solving physics problems [1]. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may inform how these processes occur, but currently no neuroimaging studies have examined how students develop physics problem-solving skills. To provide insight into the neural nature of physics learning we examined resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in brain regions associated with problem-solving. Meta-analysis identified the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) as the region most consistently implicated across problem-solving tasks. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired pre/post instruction in eight undergraduate, first-time enrollees in introductory physics. Correspondence between post-instruction rsFC and meta-analytic results suggests a semester of university physics may facilitate enhanced recruitment of posterior brain regions involved in reasoning. Increased IFG-correlated activity from pre to post instruction indicates intrinsic brain connectivity may be modulated as a result of educational experience.

Instruction that makes use of contrasting cases has been extremely successful. Furthermore, contrasting cases appear to be at the center of expert problem-solving strategies. Previously we have shown that physics experts make use of contrasting cases more frequently than any other epistemological or reasoning process resource. Gaining a deeper understanding of the function of these contrasting cases can help physics educators better incorporate contrasting cases into instruction. In this talk, we analyze the function of contrasting cases as a part of the problem- solving process of a group of physics experts as they solve a novel, challenging physics problem. We show how the ideas of variation theory can help us better understand the function of these contrasting cases and discuss how the knowledge gained through this analysis can inform the development of effective instruction.

Self-efficacy beliefs that play a major role in determining teachers science teaching practices have been an important area of concern for pre-service science teacher education. This mixed-methods study investigated the changes in pre-service elementary teachers science self-efficacy beliefs and its relationship with changes in science content understandings in a specialized physics content course. Participants included 51 pre-service elementary science teachers enrolled in two term of the course. Data collection included implementation of Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument-B (STEBI-B) and Physical Science Concept Test as pre- and post-test as well as semi-structured interviews, observations and artifacts. A pre-post, repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) design was used to test the significance of differences between the pre- and post-surveys across time. Results indicated statistically significant gains in participants self-efficacy beliefs, personal science teaching beliefs, and outcome expectancy beliefs. Additionally, a positive moderate relationship between science conceptual understandings and personal science teaching efficacy beliefs was found. Findings from qualitative analysis suggest that despite of the nature of prior science experiences pre-service teachers previously had, exposure to a specialized content course that integrates relevant content along with modeled instructional strategies can positively impact self-efficacy beliefs. One implication from this study is that instructors teaching elementary physics content courses could shape science experiences within these courses to potentially support pre-service science teachers self-efficacy beliefs and confidence to teach in future.

Physics Education Research focuses on increasing student engagement and conceptual understanding, prompting different research groups to develop and use new teaching methods and materials in place of traditional ones. It is important for us to understand the basic features that present in course materials and their impacts on students learning. As part of a project to identify successful teaching strategies in studio physics, we are exploring how physics tutorials help students taking algebra-based introductory physics develop conceptual understanding using argumentation in small-group discussion. In order to identify basic features of tutorials, we conducted a literature review and did content analysis of physics tutorials; then, we videotaped groups of students working through physics tutorials. We analyzed the transcriptions of the students discussions and compared them to pre- and post-test results to understand how basic features facilitate students use of argumentation and development of conceptual understanding

The ability to judge the difficulty of physics problems has implications for both exam preparation and performance. Previous research has shown that students spend more time studying problems they judge as more difficult, but this strategy is effective only when these judgments match the normative difficulty of the questions. Little is known about how accurate instructors and students are at judging problem difficulty. We present data from two experiments where physics experts and introductory physics students predict which question of a pair taken from real exams is more difficult for the typical student. In the first experiment we analyze whether the rationales given by physics experts are predictive of accurate judgments. In the second experiment we compare the accuracy of experts and novices in their judgments. We discuss the educational implications of our findings.

Student reasoning in physics is often context dependent. A possible explanation is that salient features in physics problems may cue automatic and subconscious (System 1) reasoning. Students often accept these first-available responses without question and do not reflect on their reasoning processes, even when such processes are unproductive and preclude the use of relevant conceptual understanding. Metacognition, the monitoring and regulation of ones thinking, around these salient features has the potential to address such difficulties. As part of a broader effort to identify methods for improving student learning in physics by explicitly supporting and enhancing student metacognition, we are currently investigating an instructional intervention focused on the development of students metacognitive knowledge about salient features and cued System 1 reasoning. In this intervention, students are guided to synthesize contrasting cases involving sample student responses and descriptive vignettes highlighting the targeted metacognitive knowledge. Preliminary data and emerging findings will be presented.

Collaborative group-learning environments, including studio-based or SCALE-UP instruction, have grown in popularity and implementation at a wide variety of institutions. We are engaged in a multi-institutional project aimed at studying the factors that contribute to the success of student-centered pedagogical approaches in algebra-based physics courses. In this regard, the GW group is specifically focusing on documenting instructor actions and student activities taking place in the classroom; thus, we have been conducting systematic observations and analyses of various classroom environments. Our data, recorded as a chronological series of codes in the Teaching Dimensions Observational Protocol (TDOP), reflect the time sequence and pedagogical characteristics of classroom events. We have used a PER evidence-based approach to choose an efficient set of codes and have applied these codes during many observations at GW as well as at our partner institutions. We present here our final list of TDOP codes and inter-rater reliability results from our field-testing of this code set.

Student-centered instruction can lead to strong gains in physics learning. However, even after targeted instruction, many students still struggle to analyze unfamiliar situations systematically. As a part of an ongoing investigation of student reasoning in the context of carefully designed, research-based scaffolded instruction, sequences of questions have been developed that allow for probing the relationships among conceptual understanding, reasoning, and intuition. Results from sequences of questions administered in the introductory calculus-based mechanics course will be presented. The dual process theory of reasoning will be applied to interpret the results. Implications for research and instruction will be discussed.

Students have substantial difficulties applying physics concepts to anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology (AP&P;) and vice versa. We have focused our research on developing a kinesthetic circulatory system, which requires students to apply multiple concepts (conservation of mass, compliance, Bernoulli and Hagen-Poiseuille principles) to understanding the operation of the cardiovascular system. Kinesthetic models allow students to manipulate different aspects of the simulated system. We engineered a circulatory system model made of transparent plastic tubing of different radii, branched connectors, balloons, and pumps that enabled students to see the fluid travel at different speeds (visually) and pressures (through pressure sensors) as the fluid travels through a model cardiovascular system. Pre- and post- assessment through interviews, open-ended questions and draft multiple-choice questions indicate substantial improvement in student understanding and appreciation of real fluid dynamics concepts. Two other IPLS Kinesthetic models are also being developed surrounding the physics concepts encompassing diffusion and electrophoresis. *Supported by NSF DUE 1044154

Recently the physics community has been conducting transformations to make physics classes more relevant to life science majors. A primary goal for many of these classes is to help students to develop coherent understanding of essential ideas that span multiple disciplines. Energy, for example, is an important idea in biology, chemistry, and physics, but students often compartmentalize their knowledge and do not see energy as an essential idea to all three disciplines. This presentation will outline the preliminary development of an instrument based on semi-structured interviews to assess how students connect essential ideas across introductory science disciplines. This instrument will provide important information to the research community about the effects of ongoing and future university initiatives in making progress in our design of physics for life science majors classes.

Iconic problems have proven to be a useful paradigm to analyze physics curricula. Though these share many of the characteristics of threshold concepts (transformative, integrative, bounded, ) the iconic problem paradigm allows a closer analysis to the physics curriculum by identifying key problems. Recently the author has begun using the iconic problem paradigm to identify key topics in the biology used in an IPLS course. The paper focuses on the characteristics of iconic problems and their relationship to threshold concepts, identifying the iconic physics problems in an IPLS course, and reports on the characterization of the biology topics of the IPLS course as iconic problems/threshold concepts.

Designed to both uncover areas of students difficulty as well as provide a reliable and valid method to measure student learning, Conceptual Learning Assessment Instruments (CLAIs) have been essential to the pedagogical improvement within many physics courses. However, to date there exists a dearth of CLAIs developed specifically to assess students conceptual understanding of concepts unique to the introductory physics courses for life sciences (IPLS). To fill this need, we are currently developing a Fluid Dynamics CLAI specifically for the IPLS course. One of the first steps in assessment development is the determination of the concept domain that will be utilized to create the instrument. We chose to use a Delphi process to reach a consensus among 14+ physics, biology and biophysics on the key concepts to be covered on the instrument. In this talk, we will discuss the details of Delphi process and present the final fluid dynamics concept domain.

Research and logic both indicate that students learn more when they are engaged with the material. In a two-week summer transition course for students planning to major in any STEM field, we related all physics content to motor vehicle collisions. The students in the course had a wide range of previous exposure to physics and a range of intended majors (biology, chemistry, physics/engineering, math and environmental science). The topic engaged non-physics majors and allowed students with extensive preparation in physics to work on more advanced exercises, such as accident reconstruction. Students responded positively to the topic and more importantly, showed a normalized gain on the FCI of 0.230.06 (SE), comparable to a full semester, traditional lecture physics course. We will present an overview of the course, sample exercises and students responses to the course. This approach could be effectively modified for any introductory physics course.

Research has shown that ILE can be an effective learning environment for acquiring transferrable knowledge. These classroom review sessions took place at the beginning of each class meeting throughout the two courses and were student directed. To quantify students participation we coded the review session in real time without videotaping according to a coding scheme that we developed which included codes for interacting, disengagement and uncodable. Each student was assigned a single code for the entire review session. We found that students interactional codes during the first semester were strongly predictive of their interactional codes during a subsequent semester. This indicates that students directed interaction does not bring changes in their nature of participation.

A one-quarter-long algebra-based introductory physics course for pre-health and life science majors at Portland State features authentic biomedically inspired physics content. The course uses multimedia-learning-modules via flipitphysics.com (formerly smartphysics). These modules include videos with biomedical experts explaining aspects of specific biomedical equipment. Students answer "Pre-lecture questions" and "Checkpoints" during and after these videos on both the medical content covered in the video media and the physics concepts in written materials provided for students in order to prepare them for activities during the class. Students continue to engage with the material during class and through online homework assignments that explore the connections of physics and the medical field in a quantitative manner. We have attempted to assess the cognitive level using a modified Blooms taxonomy with further analysis of questions sequence and student performance. We also report on the positive impact on students attitudes as measured by the CLASS.

The importance of strengthening STEM education in public schools is a theme that is currently at the center of discussions in education reform. Research has shown that in order to improve science programs we first need to develop good teacher education programs. In this study we investigate whether a redesigned physics class for future elementary teachers addresses three main issues in elementary teacher preparation (Mikeska et al. 2009): engagement in science, understanding of childrens ideas of science, and understanding the relevance of what future teachers learn in class for their impending careers. To do this we evaluate whether the incorporation of social structures in the class impact students engagement in science by integrating PCK into the core of the class to see if it produces changes in students knowledge of kids ideas and frames learning in an expansive manner that promotes transfer. *Supported in part by NSF grant 1140855.

When grading student papers it seems that students are always changing their multiple choice answers from right to wrong. Colleagues have made similar observations and some books on test taking advise against answer changing.(1) Intrigued, I collected some data and dug a little deeper into the research. My hypothesis was that students most frequently changed their answers from right to wrong. The subjects were 985 college physics students enrolled in a two-semester calculus-based physics course. Did students most frequently change their answers from right to wrong, from wrong to right or from wrong to wrong? How do my results compare to similar studies? Was there a difference between results for the two semesters? Answers to these questions will be discussed as well as implications for further studies.

Not all wrong answer choices are created equal. We introduce a new tool for adoption by high school and college-level physics teachers who use a common assessment such as the Force Concept Inventory (FCI). The tool uses a spreadsheet application to create a simple matrix that identifies the percentage of students that who select each possible pre-/post-test answer combination on each question of the diagnostic exam such as the FCI. Having ranked each answer choice from best to worst (using Item Response Curves as our guide), the transition matrices provide detailed information on the percentages of students that move toward better or worse answer choices on the pre-/post-test and identify the misconceptions they may have. The transition matrices tool provides a way to better meet the needs of our students by tailoring our instruction in an informed way.

Physics education research has consistently shown that students have higher learning outcomes when enrolled in interactive-engagement courses. Consequently, many schools are actively reforming their introductory curricula. For courses where the interactive sections (labs, tutorials, and/or workshops) are mostly taught by graduate student teaching assistants (TAs), good TAs are instrumental to the success of the reform. Many studies have investigated specific interactions between TAs and students, but more can be learned through a holistic examination of TA-student interactions. Over the course of one semester, I observed TAs in their various teaching roles using the Real-time Instructor Observation Tool (RIOT). These observations serve to show what TAs may default to with little to no intervention. I present a snapshot of a department in the early stages of reform and discuss how we used RIOT data to develop training targeted to the specific needs of our TAs.

During the summer of 2014, a faculty team developed a student laboratory skills assessment program to be given in the laboratory courses taken by physics majors. We created a program where the assessment instruments, while unique to each course, all followed a theme that students should be able to set up equipment to Acquire some signal, Analyze data related to the signal, and Assimilate the results by communicating results in a manner consistent with departmental goals. We call the evaluation of students ability for Acquisition, Analysis and Assimilation our AAA activities. This talk is a report on the results from initial implementation in our courses over the past year and an update on the progress made to develop a consistent set of laboratory skills assessment rubrics across the intermediate and advanced laboratory courses in the UW-Whitewater physics program.

Language ambiguities in concept meanings can exacerbate student conceptual difficulties with physics concepts. This is especially true for the construct of weight which is defined in more than one way even by physicists and textbooks and causes particular confusion in accelerating cases. We devised an approach for teaching weight, weightlessness and free fall, which first explains the various physics concepts involved before naming them, discusses the language ambiguities explicitly, and discusses the terms/concepts in multiple physical situations. Three instructors implemented the innovative lesson sequence in three different sections of an introductory physics course. We assessed understanding of the physics concepts using conceptual assessments and surveyed students understanding of the language issues. The results exceeded expectations, with remarkably high practically significant learning gains for the physics concepts, a good appreciation of the language issues and intellectual satisfaction with their grasp of not only conceptual issues but also language issues.

"Responsive teaching," that is, teaching in which instructors shape instruction in response to students ideas, is a promising approach that serves to integrate the epistemic, conceptual, and "practice" aspects of scientific inquiry. However, clearly characterizing this instructional practice is challenging, as is providing professional development to support responsive teaching. In this talk, I will discuss an approach therapy, "Motivational Interviewing," as a possible direction for both characterizing and supporting this practice.

The Big Five Inventory (BFI) measuring the 5-factor personality model was given to 440 science and engineering students in introductory physics classes at a large U.S. university. Science and engineering students showed similar personality characteristics as would be expected from measurements of the general population, with women scoring significantly differently only on the neuroticism scale. The BFI facets had differential explanatory power for test average and course grade with the conscientiousness facet as the only significant treatment effect for course grade, but it was not significant for test average. High school GPA explained substantially different levels of variance in course grade for male and female students; these differences were reduced with the addition of BFI facets to the regression models.

Generally, it is difficult to assess the knowledge and competencies of physics students at high school, who prepare for contests. There are multiple educational approaches, such as didactical and competency-based methodologies which can help either teachers or students to improve their skills in problem-solving techniques and understanding Physics phenomena. However, using such traditional methods, it is hard to evaluate and control the individual learning progress of students continuously. Therefore, application of Educational Framework Tools seems to be a good choice to extend the support functions in classes. This paper discusses the benefits of E-learning technologies applied to helping students for physics contest preparations. Several embedded E-learning functions are being applied and to tuition in physics. The outcome of innovative educational methods and extensions has been evaluated. Our tuition methods resulted in achieving a dynamically changing educational framework that can be matched to our students and to the actual physics contest.

In this talk, we analyze students identity trajectories as undergraduate physics majors participating in physics research. Students in the study participated in an elective seminar in which they were paired with graduate students and faculty mentors on physics research projects and participated in a weekly discussions about research. In one-on-one interviews and classroom discussions, students described changes in their participation in the broader physics community, as well as more sophisticated ideas about what constitutes participation in that community. Using their narrative accounts, we discuss students trajectories of their participation in the community, highlighting relational dynamics between themselves and other members of the physics community. Finally, we draw out connections between these trajectories, which have implications for future research and programmatic design.

It was postulated that if students reflected metacognitively on textual material before coming to class and then had interventions in class that had them examine subjects that produce cognitive dissonance, the students epistemological beliefs would evolve from those characterizing a novice learning towards those consistent with a more expert learner. This hypothesis was tested through a five-year study involving close to 1000 students at two institutions, in four physics courses. Using student interviews, writing product assessments, and the Discipline-Focused Epistemological Beliefs Questionnaire (DFEBQ) as a pre-and post-test of the students, our results, based on both qualitative and quantitative data, are a strong indication that a combination of an activity that gets students to examine textual material metacognitively (Reflective Writing) with one or more interactive interventions can promote positive change in students epistemological beliefs.

This fall we have introduced a new type of online homework activity designed to help students become proficient with some fundamental concepts necessary to succeed in introductory physics. For each concept several equivalent sets of questions have been created. Each student is assigned one set of the questions. Instead of being given immediate feedback on the correctness of their answers, they are given help in the form of the solution to a different version of the questions. This talk will summarize results from the student interactions, and implications for improving student learning from online homework activities.

Education developers in STEM fields have many ideas on improving undergraduate instruction, but often these ideas fail to propagate to other educators. Our research group has worked to understand best practices in developing educational innovations with sustainable adoption by others in mind. We have run in-person and online workshops in which we train others and have them apply what they learned to their grant proposals. In this talk, we discuss the benefits and limitations of an online setting for professional development and online workshops as a dissemination mechanism.

The Postsecondary Instructional Practices Survey (PIPS), developed by a team of researchers at Western Michigan University, is a valid and reliable survey instrument to measure teaching practices in higher education. The survey asks respondents to describe how representative a set of statements is of their teaching (e.g., I provide feedback on student assignments without assigning a formal grade.) One way to analyze the data is using instructor-centered and student-centered categories. These categories can be graphically represented as a scatterplot with quadrants indicating different levels of instructor- and student-centered practices. In this presentation, we further our understanding of the quantitative survey data through qualitative data. We interviewed survey respondents in each quadrant to learn more about their teaching practices and to be able to better interpret what each quadrant means in terms of teaching practices.

Improved problem-solving is considered one of the primary student learning goals for many physics courses, yet most textbooks do not describe the complexities of problem-solving. To be successful at problem-solving, students must learn to employ metacognitive skills so they can monitor and correct their own work. This process typically yields non-linear solutions that bear little resemblance to the worked examples in textbooks. A survey of how popular introductory physics texts describe and illustrate the problem-solving process will be presented. Most portray problem-solving as a linear process devoid of any metacognition. Rather than showing examples of how one can identify and correct errors within a solution with monitoring, they show only correct and optimized solutions. Implications for teachers and students will be discussed.

Shared experiences, shared culture, and a strong sense of community play an important role in instructional environments in the Chicago State University STEM program. In this presentation we explore how listening to student input and connecting our science education efforts to the culture and community of our population has allowed us, as researchers and instructors that often come from different communities, to develop a more effective program. The CSU Learning Assistant (LA) Program and the CSU S-STEM Program will serve as examples of efforts toward building a welcoming, community-based learning environment.

This project focuses on finding a meaningful way to write multiple-choice questions on exams. One of the most important aspects of a physics exam is to test the students' ability to solve problems, not just answer questions. We have also noticed that when grading free-response problems on physics tests for large classes, it is necessary to use a certain rubric. In other words, it is necessary to be able to quickly look for certain mistakes and take off a certain number of points for that mistake. This process becomes very formulaic. We have substituted a series of multiple-choice questions for each worked-out problem. One free-response problem is rotated between versions of the test as a check. So far, this has worked well and doesnt appear to have changed the way the students prepare for exams.

I present examples of design for physics educators, based on a user-centered process for designing websites and software. This process includes: interviews with the target audience to determine their needs and expectations; identification of key tasks that the website must enable; design of pages to support those tasks; usability testing to ensure that the site meets users needs; and design iteration based on the results of usability testing. I summarize lessons learned from the design of several websites that offer educational materials and tools to physics educators, and present examples of how the particular needs of this audience can be best addressed in web design. I offer recommendations for anyone wishing to offer educational research or materials via the web.

Self-regulation is an internal process where students create an effective environment for constructing knowledge. Constructivist-learning theory suggests that strong self-regulators are efficient learners. Grader assessment feedback (GAF) is a powerful tool instructors can utilize to influence student self-regulation and thus student construction of knowledge. I present results found by applying a qualitative coding scheme, developed in a previous pilot study, in a quasi-experimental investigation. Previously, it was found that students are demonstrating all the aspects of self-regulation defined in this study and different styles of GAF result in different manifestations of student self-regulation. This study presents results from survey data collected in different semesters, different populations, and with a significantly larger sample size. The same coding scheme, along with any open codes that develop, will be used to determine what physics student self-regulation looks like and how different GAF styles affect physics student self-regulation in light of the preliminary data.

Research has shown that even after targeted instruction designed to address student conceptual and reasoning difficulties, some introductory physics students still tend to apply intuitive rather than formal reasoning on specific types of questions. In this study, metacognitive interventions were designed and implemented in an effort to encourage the students to reflect on their thought processes. Specifically, students were asked to consider alternative solutions, identify formal and intuitive approaches, and reflect on their own thinking. The impact of these metacognitive interventions on student reasoning was examined. The dual-process theory to reasoning and decision-making was applied in order to interpret the results. *This work has been supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.

Physics by Inquiry (PbI) is a research-based and research-validated curriculum designed by the Physics Education Group at the University of Washington. (1) Development and testing has taken place both in courses for K-12 teachers and in courses for students who are under-prepared for STEM-related careers. The guided-inquiry instructional approach has proved effective at helping both populations develop a firm conceptual understanding of basic physics topics, while also enhancing their reasoning and problem solving skills and their understanding of the scientific process. This talk will provide insight and data that support the use of PbI in providing an opportunity for under-prepared students to develop in-depth understanding, proficiency in the targeted skills, and recognition of the usefulness of the PbI experience in their future study of STEM topics.

We recorded pre-service physics teachers learning about the physics of solar cells. Using a knowledge-in-pieces theoretical framework, we analyze their interactions in order to make inferences about the elements of prior knowledge they call upon as they build understanding of how these devices function. Of special interest are the instances when a student makes a significant conceptual breakthrough. We find that students who combine different aspects of their prior knowledge in specific ways may be more likely to make breakthroughs. We will discuss what instructors can do to prime learners to combine knowledge in productive ways so they are better able to achieve these breakthroughs.

As part of an ongoing investigation of the development of student reasoning abilities in physics, we have been examining inconsistencies in student reasoning in introductory physics courses. Research has shown that even when students demonstrate that they possess the formal knowledge and skills necessary to answer specific types of questions correctly, some of these students abandon formal reasoning in favor of more intuitive approaches on analogous tasks. For this reason, we have been identifying and developing sequences of questions that allow for the disentanglement of various factors that affect student thinking (e.g., conceptual understanding, reasoning abilities, and contextual cues). Preliminary results from one such sequence will be presented and interpreted using the dual-process theory of reasoning and decision-making. *This work has been supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.

This study was motivated by research findings that suggest that, on certain topics, student conceptual and reasoning difficulties persist even after instruction expressly designed to address such difficulties. We have been developing a suite of different metacognitive interventions for use in introductory calculus-based physics courses. Interventions intended to promote (individual) student metacognition were administered in a web-based format outside of class. Interventions supporting socially mediated metacognition were implemented as part of laboratory instruction. The metacognitive interventions were multi-layered in order to address specific types of student responses. The impacts of these interventions were assessed on a course exam.

Upper division physics courses combine challenging physics content with increased mathematical complexity. Many physics departments offer a course in mathematical methods to help prepare students for upper-division theory courses in electricity and magnetism, classical mechanics, and modern physics. As part of an NSF-supported research and curriculum development project, we have studied student reasoning in math methods using written free-response problems and individual student interviews. In this talk we present data on student reasoning with series approximations collected in the context of a meth methods course.

Understanding of Electricity & Magnetism in the upper-division requires a considerable amount of integration of calculus concepts with abstract physics concepts. The ability to incorporate the use of vectors in several different coordinate systems is an essential skill in an E&M; course. This study aims to understand how students think about coordinate systems and vectors in non-Cartesian coordinate systems (plane polar and spherical). Data was collected in a math methods course for physics majors over several semesters, using free response written questions posed on ungraded quizzes and graded course assessments given after instruction. Student responses were coded and assigned to categories. As an example, many students answering incorrectly appear to be overgeneralizing from Cartesian coordinate systems in ways that are not productive.

In this talk, we will describe research involving simple situations in the context of energy, for instance, a student lifting a book near the surface of the Earth. We analyze the reasoning sequence that students must go through to complete these questions correctly, and identify the points at which students are most likely to fail to move through the chain appropriately.

This study investigates how introductory students and graduate students view and interpret motion graphs. Participants viewed several graphs of position, velocity, or acceleration versus time on a computer screen while their eye movements were recorded using a stationary eye tracker. Participants were asked to select which region of the graph best matched a description of motion and provide a verbal explanation for their choice. We compare performance on the questions with the audio-recorded explanations and eye movements.

As part of a broader study on the content of and student thinking within mathematics in the undergraduate physics curriculum, we report on student thinking about coordinate systems in the upper division. Early evidence suggests that upper-division physics students struggle to solve problems and answer conceptual questions requiring the use of Cartesian and non-Cartesian coordinate systems. Specifically, students have difficulty identifying the direction of unit vectors and constructing symbolic expressions for position and velocity in the plane polar coordinates. Additionally, students struggle to recognize appropriate units associated with these quantities. We report findings from one-on-one interviews that used a think aloud protocol designed to shed light on student thinking within this domain. We investigate the potential connection between student reasoning regarding Cartesian and non-Cartesian coordinates with emphasis on polar and spherical coordinate systems, and students ability to answer conceptual questions and solve problems requiring the use of those coordinate systems.

In a previous study, we found that many students experienced significant difficulties with a basic task in which they were asked to express a distance in terms of wavelength. At the same time, most students were capable of measuring a distance in terms of nonstandard units (e.g., a pencil) in a more everyday context. Various factors were considered in attempt to account for this failure to transfer relevant skills between the two tasks. For example, we considered the roles of representation, context, mathematical emphasis of instruction on interference, and others. In the current study, we designed a sequence of questions to probe the impact of epistemology on student judgment about the type of reasoning required to complete this task. Multiple data streams (including written responses, interviews, and eye-tracking data) were used to gain insight into student thinking. *This work has been supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.

Student time use is a major element of success in any course, especially in physics courses in which expertise is earned largely through exposure to the problem-solving process. Surveys were developed which probed the distribution of student time use across various typical tasks associated with the introductory, calculus-based physics sequence. These surveys were implemented at four points in each the fall 2015 and spring 2016 semesters. Two of these surveys explored time use during weeks in which students were preparing for the first two exams of the semester, while the other two were implemented during typical non-test weeks. Measurements of incoming student SAT/ACT score, student grade expectations and student test grades were taken. An analysis of this data, including how students at large and potential sub-categories of students regulate their time use in response to exam scores and grade expectations, will be discussed.

Using the Real-time Instructor Observing Tool (RIOT), we observed six Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) and coded for the amount of time they spent on various teaching actions to create an action profile. The GTAs were teaching in a student-centered combined recitation and laboratory mini-studio. At the end of the semester, we asked all GTAs to use the RIOT protocol to describe action profiles from several perspectives: 1) what the course designers want; 2) what the GTA thinks is most helpful; 3) what the students think is most helpful; and 4) what the GTA thinks his/her actual profile resembles. In this talk we compare the responses of an exemplary GTA to find a high amount of buy-in to the mini-studio method but an actual profile that more closely resembled what she believed her students wanted. These findings are supported by the GTAs other responses about her teaching experiences.

Understanding of physics-related concepts is often quantified through physics problem-solving (PPS) assessments. However, no study has characterized neurobiological processes underlying PPS or skill development via classroom instruction. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to delineate PPS brain networks and probe differences resulting from classroom instruction. 15 students underwent pre- and identical post-instruction PPS fMRI sessions. We assessed brain activity and identified regions more engaged post- relative to pre-instruction (P<0.05). Data revealed consistent fronto-parietal networks contributing to PPS. Moreover, significantly increased post-instruction fMRI activity in posterior medial cortex (PMC), accompanied by improved PPS scores, implicated this regions critical role in skill development. As PMC supports spatial memory and attentional focus [1,2], these novel neurobiological observations provide insight into how education experience may augment brain activity which, in turn, contributes to enhanced PPS skills.

This paper presents an analysis of the effect of pre-preparation and effort on the performance in a physics class using data collected over 21 semesters (N=1747). An overall significant negative correlation with total time out-of-class time invested was found (p<0.0001). Cluster analysis was used to identify distinct subgroups of students with different levels of incoming preparation for the class and distinctly different out-of-class study behaviors. The highest performing subgroup invested the lowest out-of-class time but began the class with superior preparation in the material covered. Representation of students of different gender was not uniform across the set of clusters (p<0.0001). Female students were underrepresented in the cluster of students with high pre-preparation and overrepresented in the cluster whose primary mode of exam preparation was reading. Male students were overrepresented in the cluster identified by the failure to submit required assignments.

In order to achieve broader educational change in STEM discipline, research suggests that we need to engage faculty within a discipline, with opportunities to reflect on their teaching over long periods of time. One strategy that achieves this is the embedded expert model, where postdocs and other educational experts are partnered with faculty within a department to support course transformation. This model has been successfully used in the Science Education Initiative (http://colorado.edu/sei) at two institutions, using postdoctoral fellows as embedded experts. This model is being adapted and studied at seven institutions, using various embedded experts, in a new NSF-funded project (TRESTLE; http://www.colorado.edu/csl/trestle) in order to test how this intervention can be implemented in different institutional contexts to propagate widespread STEM education reform. I will discuss the embedded expert model, past results, the variations used in TRESTLE, and how we plan to test them.

Over the past few decades many innovations to improve undergraduate STEM education have been developed, only to fizzle out as they struggle to find an audience. Funding agencies have noticed this problem and are putting increased attention on development projects that build in aspects of sustainability after the project funding has ended. In recent years there has been research done within physics and STEM education on developing and disseminating education research projects. But, there is a much longer history and body of literature with common goals in the business literature related to product development and innovation.

Paired (or co-) teaching is an arrangement in which two faculty are collaboratively responsible for all aspects of teaching a course. By pairing an instructor experienced in research-based instructional strategies (RBIS) with an instructor with little or no experience in RBIS, paired teaching can be used to promote the adoption of RBIS. We report on several examples of instructors who were the relative novices in such pairs. Using data from in-class observations, the Teaching Practices Inventory, and interviews with the instructors, we characterize the extent to which they have continued using RBIS in the courses they have taught after pair-teaching. Preliminary results indicate both a continued use of RBIS when teaching in the same course that they pair-taught in and some transfer of RBIS to new contexts.

In the MainePSP*, we have observed students improve the way they analyze thermal energy after instruction, but that many of them continue to use the idea that coldness transfers. Past researchers have identified that cold is commonly perceived as a separate heat energy. Nevertheless, we have not found specific activities to address this idea. We present the analysis of a collaborative session among K-12 teachers who were trying to analyze how to address coldness in the classroom. During the sessions, teachers got to model the energy in two different scenarios which include an object in room temperature interacting with snow. Then, teachers interacted with two simulations that address thermal energy to consider their utility as an instructional tool. Engaging teachers in these activities led to additional insights and questions about how to convincingly address students observable experience, that coldness transfers, using a thermal energy model.

Robust physics and engineering identities are strong predictors of students choice to pursue a degree in physics or engineering; students who go into either of these fields are often drawn from the same pool of potentially interested high schoolers, who must decide between majoring in the two fields. Many studies of engineering students have treated them as a homogenous population or focus only on one sub-discipline, rather than distinguishing engineers between disciplines more carefully. Recently, we surveyed students on several attitudinal constructs, such as Grit, the Big 5 Personality Traits, and Performance-Approach mindset, which have been correlated with the development of identity and academic success in these fields. Using data from the 2,966 introductory engineering students surveyed, we investigate the associations between student attitudes and both physics and engineering identity and disaggregate by major to uncover differences and similarities which will help broaden a conversation about who can be an engineer.

A recent study of students in a calculus-based introductory physics course found that students performed significantly better on vector addition and subtraction tasks when the questions were given using the ijk representation instead of an "arrows-on-a-grid'' representation, and also presented evidence that working knowledge of the ijk format was necessary to correctly perform vector operations in the arrow format. A follow-up study found that students in an algebra-based physics course also performed significantly higher in the ijk representation than the arrow representation in both one- and two-dimensional problems, even though no explicit ijk instruction was given in the course. In a subsequent investigation we asked students in the algebra-based course to physically interpret their answers, in order to assess if the higher performance on ijk questions indicates physical understanding or is the result of algorithmic "plug-and-chug'' thinking. Our findings will be discussed along with instructional implications.

The CSU Learning Assistant (LA) program has grown from three students, in one discipline, to 19 students, in five disciplines. Central to this growth is the cultivation of teaching partnerships between LAs and faculty. In these partnerships, student ideas are valued and leveraged to improve the program, inform LA programs across the country, and publicize the program at the local and national level. In this talk we explore how recent interviews with LAs and the implementation of an LA Panel at CSU allows faculty and peers to get a glimpse of the LA Program that would not be possible without student voice. We also explore how the use of student voice to inform the program can create broad scale buy in for the LA Program and other types of instructional reform in the STEM classroom.

Though communication is essential for success in STEM careers, it is typically a minor focus within the undergraduate physics curriculum. With the emphasis of argumentation in K-12 NGSS and key role of collaboration and discussion in active learning environments, it is important to more fully understand how such practices prepare students to communicate effectively in STEM careers. We conducted 30 semi-structured interviews with new hires and their managers in academia and industry, using the field of optics as a disciplinary focus. We coded these interviews using emergent and grounded theory approaches to better understand how communication skills were developed and used in the workplace. Findings include a taxonomy of diverse communication skills ranging from written (e.g. documentation), visual (e.g. interpreting diagrams), and oral (e.g. asking questions) communication. In each case there were unexpected situations where communication was necessary and inseparable from technical knowledge used in the workplace.

Self-regulation is a self-initiated process through which students identify obstacles to their learning, find strategies that will allow them to overcome those obstacles, and finally exert the effort needed to succeed. Through collection of student responses to a web-based survey, we investigate what student self-regulation looks like across different undergraduate physics populations. Specifically, we examine how different styles of feedback on assessments correlate with students self-regulation. We combine two models of self-regulation (1) the Winne & Hadwin model which describes how external feedback influences student self-regulation and (2) Zimmermans cyclical model of student self-regulation consisting of the phases forethought, self-control, and self-judgement to create an a priori coding scheme. Informed by our theory of self-regulation, we also develop emergent, open codes from the data. We hypothesize that instructors can use particular feedback to influence subcomponents of student self-regulation, aiding students knowledge construction.

To realize this vision, Access and its member programs empower students as co-leaders, giving them voice and ownership over local and national efforts. Access sites focus on fostering supportive learning communities, engaging students in authentic science practices, and attending to students' development as STEM professionals. Programmatically, sites offer a range of services from summer programs to academic year mentoring. In this talk, we will share preliminary evidence of our networks efforts: (1) building a community of student representatives committed to communicating across sites, celebrating local successes, and supporting each other through local struggles, (2) developing and implementing our first in-person gathering of student representatives from Access sites, and (3) fostering routines for sharing of ideas across sites.

Physics education researchers have created research results, teaching methods, curricula, and assessments that can dramatically improve physics education. PhysPort (www.physport.org) is the go-to place for ordinary physics faculty to find resources for research-based teaching and assessment. First released in 2011 as the PER User's Guide, PhysPort has undergone re-branding, redesign, and expansion, including many new resources: overviews of over 50 research-based teaching methods and over 50 research-based assessment instruments, Expert Recommendations, the Virtual New Faculty Workshop, the Periscope collection of video-based TA training and faculty professional development materials, and the Assessment Data Explorer, an interactive tool for faculty to get instant analysis and visualization of their students responses to research-based assessment instruments including the FCI, BEMA, and CLASS, and compare their results to national averages and students like theirs. The development of PhysPort includes research to determine faculty needs and usability testing to ensure that we meet those needs.

Because so few physics faculty are formally trained in education and pedagogy, in-service faculty professional development workshops are important for improving teaching skills. While these workshops often address the importance of engaging students in active and reflective classroom activities, emergent research suggests that more can be done to engage faculty workshop attendees in active and reflective activities. In this presentation, we discuss analysis of data collected from implementation of the SPOTing Effective Teaching Workshop series, a professional development experience that integrates use of the Student Participation Observational Tool (SPOT) within a faculty community of practice. This experience incorporates interactive and reflective elements to guide faculty in a shared experience of analyzing their teaching and discussing alternative approaches. Results indicate that as a result of this experience, faculty articulate pedagogical discontentment and identify desired changes to their teaching practice that are more in line with active, student-centered approaches.

Michigan State University (MSU) has collected a wide body of data on students for over 10 years allowing for a robust, statistical picture to be painted of how students enter and exit the physics world. This data includes course grade, gender, ethnicity, student major choices, etc. and can help us paint a pathway of every student who has received a physics bachelor's degree at MSU. While this data set contains over 100,000 students who have taken math and physics courses at MSU only 2% of these students have declared a physics major and only 0.5% of students have gone on to graduate with a bachelors in physics. Students who declare physics and then move away from the major perform poorly in introductory courses and are demographically different from the typical physics graduate.

Students perceptions of self-efficacy in the general university environment have been extensively studied and findings suggest that self-efficacy plays a role in student success. The role of perceived self-efficacy in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) student success is investigated in the current research. A survey measuring students feelings of self-efficacy within multiple environments, including science, mathematics and physics classes as well as within their major department and intended future career, was developed based on Pintrich et al. Self-Efficacy for Learning Performance subscale of the Motivated Learning Strategies Questionnaire. The survey was administered over the fall 2015 and spring 2016 semesters and demographic data was gathered for the introductory, calculus-based physics classes. An analysis of student perceived self-efficacy and its relation to student success will be discussed. The effect of gender and major on perceived self-efficacy and student success will also be explored.

Modern digital technologies allow students to engage in inquiry-based activities in topics that have traditionally been out of experimental reach, such as astronomy and particle physics. An expert-like understanding of a topic requires recognition and awareness of the different roles of formalisms, computer simulations, and physical experiments. Conceptual blending (also known as conceptual integration) is a framework for describing cognitive processes. We will illustrate how conceptual blending can be used to interpret how students make sense of the motion of stellar objects, as they explore them in an interactive whiteboard-based investigative group activity. Main findings include that students quickly accept the idea of being able to throw planets into orbit in the interactive computer environment. For consolidation of learning and for building an expert-like understanding, experiences from this playful activity and from everyday life have to be projected onto formal physics theory.

The effects of instructional reforms in university physics are typically evaluated through formative assessment, standardized concept inventories and/or attitude surveys. In addition, student feedback is collected by many departments, but reports of its use in course development are rare. At the University of Helsinki, Finland, student feedback has been regularly collected at fundamental physics courses since 2007. Over the years, feedback has proven to be an invaluable source of information for course development. It has revealed characteristics of physics courses and effects of instructional reforms hardly found by other means. Key factors for success are that all students have been motivated to give their considered opinions and feedback is solely used for the purposes of course development (and not e.g. for faculty promotions). In this talk, the feedback procedure will be presented along with examples of findings.

As part of a project to explore successful strategies for using studio methods, such as SCALE-UP, we are investigating attitudes that students possess and actions they take that bolster or hinder success in their studio-mode physics courses. We interviewed SCALE-UP physics instructors at two large-enrollment research universities to explore their perspectives on the student-level variables that influence students chances of excelling in their algebra-based studio-mode physics courses. We developed a coding scheme to characterize the beneficial and detrimental student qualities instructors observe and the actions instructors take to encourage beneficial student attitudes/behaviors and discourage detrimental ones. We present a snapshot of the coding scheme used and discuss common ideas about studio-mode physics student success identified by our participants.

This study investigates the effects of various uses of Learning Assistants (LAs) on student outcomes across over 20 LA Alliance member institutions. Over 5000 physics students and 29 instructors participated in the study using the LA Supported Student Outcomes (LASSO) online student evaluation system. The Force and Motion Concept Evaluation (FMCE), Force Concept Inventory (FCI), Brief Electricity and Magnetism Assessment (BEMA), and Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM) were used by over 40 different classes across the U.S. Our analysis links course-level information (e.g. how LAs are utilized) and average LA-student interaction time to course learning gains. We will report results from various institutional settings and discuss contextual effects on student outcomes.

One of teachers greatest tools in the classroom is questioning. It has long been theorized that higher level questioning leads to students developing a better understanding of the material but no one has examined the types of questions asked in physics classrooms in great detail. We used Blooms revised taxonomy to classify the questions asked by high school physics instructors and surveyed them on what they believe their questioning patterns to be. By analyzing the distribution of question types and the teachers self-perceived questioning patterns we take a first step to better understanding the use of questioning in physics classrooms.

When creating concept inventories, we usually write questions in clusters, each cluster corresponding to a particular concept. Do these clusters appear in the data generated when students take the concept inventories, and what does this tell us about student thinking? The physics education research community has often tackled this problem using factor analysis. Other recent work has modeled test result data as a bipartite network and applied community detection algorithms to identify clusters of questions. To better understand the differences between these methods, we hypothesize a model of how students answer questions inspired by the resource framework, use the model to simulate test results with known cluster structure, and compare the two methods' ability to recover the known cluster structure. Finally, we discuss implications of these results on how we should understand the way that students generate answers to test questions.

Creating high-quality problem diagrams consumes significant resources from both instructor and publisher, yet the benefit of problem diagrams has not been confirmed by research. Using the AB experiment functionality of the edX MOOC platform, we selected 12 problems where the diagram adds no critical information for problem solving, and studied the impact of adding/removing a diagram on both student correctness and problem solving behavior. We found that providing a diagram improved 1st attempt correct rate by merely 3% overall, but reduced the fraction of students drawing their own diagram by ~10% on half of the problems. On the other half, providing a diagram have no detectable impact on either correctness or behavior. Further analysis confirmed that except for the most spatially challenging problems, MOOC students are able to compensate for the loss of a diagram by drawing their own.

Large-scale assessment data from Texas Tech University yielded evidence that most students taught traditionally in large lecture classes with online homework and predominantly multiple choice question exams, when asked to answer free-response questions, did not support their answers with logical arguments grounded in physics concepts. Their answers indicated not only their lack of conceptual understanding, but their inability to apply even lower order thinking skills to solve a problem. While correct answers indicated evidence of lower level thinking skills, when coded by a rubric based on Blooms taxonomy, incorrect and partially correct answers indicated little or no evidence of the use of thinking skills at all. The free-response format, unlike other assessment formats, allowed assessment of both their conceptual understanding and their application of thinking skills, clearly pointing out weaknesses not revealed by other assessment instruments.

Research suggests that students benefit from peer interaction and active engagement. The quality and nature of these interactions is currently being explored. Students have been surveyed at regular intervals during the second semester of trigonometry-based introductory physics to determine the frequency and self-reported quality of interactions. These interactions can be with current or past students, tutors, and instructors. Our current research focuses on the metrics of Social Network Research in an effort to refine deeper research questions regarding success in the introductory sequence and the support system that student create during the two-semester physics sequence. These metrics include centrality of students as well as segmentation of groups.

Physics instructors obtain their educational activities from a variety of sources. They may invent the activities themselves, use activities that have been designed for them by other faculty in their department, or use published materials that can be purchased or downloaded. Over the last few decades, many published materials have been tested and shown to benefit students' conceptual understanding. We have analyzed some of these published physics activities and interviewed their designers in order to better understand the principles behind them. These principles are valuable for understanding the impact that physics activities have on students and for understanding non-published activities developed by individual instructors.

Preparing graduate teaching assistants (TAs) and undergraduate learning assistants (LAs) in Introductory Physics to facilitate discovery learning in labs and tutorials is a topic of intense interest in Physics Education Research. Our model for training TAs and LAs includes an overview of pedagogical theory, roleplays targeted at specific issues in active learning, and direct feedback from multiple teaching observations throughout the semester. The content of the roleplays and other activities emphasizes the importance of discourse, questioning, and eliciting student ideas by requiring the TAs and LAs to model those practices. We examine survey data from TAs and LAs and their students, and video data and field notes from training activities and teaching observations to consider the viability of our model as a method for preparing TAs and LAs to teach physics effectively. We also reflect on our training model for its potential to train future physics faculty members in student-centered learning.

This PER study investigates the order in which conceptual topics and laboratory exercises are presented in a high school physics classroom. By varying the order of presentation of conceptual material and labs, the researchers aimed to identify if student scores and growth on conceptual measures differed in the two contexts. We hypothesized that students learning with the guided inquiry model, in which laboratory exercises preceded conceptual lessons, would demonstrate higher scores and greater growth on objective measures of learning. We further hypothesized that these students would indicate a preference for learning via the guided inquiry model. We will discuss significant differences in group means in the two learning contexts. Results of student preference surveys will also be reported in order to evaluate student perceptions of the two instructional paradigms.

Students visual attention on conceptual physics tasks with diagrams can provide us insight into how multimodality hints affect students task performance on conceptual physics tasks. We conducted a 2 (visual hint or not) 2 (text hint or not) 2 (audio hint or not) full factorial experiment design. One hundred sixty-two subjects from a conceptual physics class were recruited to participate in individual clinical interviews with randomly assigned multimodal hints according to the condition. All of the interviews were video and audio recorded. An eye tracker was used to record the subjects eye movements. The data were analyzed to compare how the experimental conditions affected performance on conceptual physics tasks and their visual attention in relevant areas on the task diagram.

Transfer of learning is a valued educational goal, but it is usually hard to achieve. Visual cues and video solutions have been shown to facilitate this process. Students from an algebra-based physics class participated in our study. Each participant solved two different sets of tasks. In each set students solved one initial task, completed an intervention depending upon condition, and then solved a near transfer and far transfer task. Students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions. The visual cue condition completed four isomorphic training tasks with visual cues. The video solution condition was shown multimedia solutions of two isomorphic tasks. The third condition completed two isomorphic training tasks with visual cues and were shown one multimedia video solution. We compared the eye movements on the initial, near transfer and far transfer tasks in the three conditions.

Improving students problem-solving skills is a basic goal of many college-level introductory physics courses. At the University of Minnesota, investigators have developed computer programs designed to provide students with coaching to help them become better at solving problems in an introductory college physics course. As a physics instructor at Normandale Community College, I am participating in a study to test the feasibility of using this computer coach interface to modify existing coaches and create new coaches suitable for students enrolled in the introductory physics classes at Normandale and to assess their usability and educational impact with Normandale students. In this talk I will report on my initial experience with using C3PO: Customizable Computer Coaches for Physics Online to create and modify physics computing coaches.

Instructors often report apparent difficulties among introductory university physics students with mathematical skills and concepts normally taught in high school or earlier. As part of a systematic effort to identify and address such difficulties, we have begun to investigate skill levels with trigonometry, basic algebra, symbolic manipulation, and vector concepts, among students in algebra- and calculus-based introductory physics. We will present a summary of our initial results, and outline a strategy for addressing these difficulties within the context of physics classes themselves.

Science practices are an integral part of learning science. Over the course of the 2015-2016 school year, high school physics students, initially unfamiliar with an inquiry-based environment, engaged in ISLE labs that focus on the development of student scientific abilities. Based on the last years investigations, we know that factors such as time, ability type, student grouping, and instructor influence student development of scientific abilities. This year, we are continuing to examine student lab reports in order to better understand the process students go through when they write these reports. The revision history feature of the Google Documents provides insight into development of discourse as well as collaboration amongst students. We also continue to investigate differences in individual and group reports and students self-assessments and reflections of their progress in development of these different abilities.

As part of an ongoing effort to investigate the learning and teaching of bipolar junction transistor circuits (e.g., the common-emitter amplifier) in physics and engineering courses, we have begun to examine student understanding of ac biasing networks. These biasing networks are critical for signal processing via transistor circuits, yet the coverage of such networks in both courses and texts is typically sparse and frequently secondary to coverage of the amplifier circuits themselves. In this cross-disciplinary project, we have been examining the extent to which students are able to correctly predict the behavior of the biasing network under both dc and ac conditions. In this presentation, we will use specific examples to highlight the most prevalent conceptual and reasoning difficulties identified. Implications for instruction emerging from this investigation will also be discussed.

Learning quantum mechanics requires students to develop new conceptual understanding and mathematical skills, and to reason differently about the nature of systems (i.e. an electron is no longer a point-like particle). We present a broad view of our research in a Modern Physics course at CU Boulder where second-year physics and engineering students learn the foundations of quantum mechanics. In this work, we focus on classically unfamiliar or unusual cases, such as tunneling and delayed choice experiments, and look at the nature of student reasoning in these situations. We present both qualitative (recorded focus group discussions) and quantitative (conceptual and epistemological survey) data and demonstrate that students are capable of engaging in sophisticated reasoning about quantum phenomena. By explicitly attending to applications and interpretation within instruction, we foster an environment in which students negotiate and grapple with quantum concepts.

The Newtonian score representation of students understanding of force and motion concepts has been a standard index in quantitative studies on conceptual transformation. Whereas students proficiency before physics instruction is associated with learning gain, the robustness of novice views is attributed to learning inefficiency among low proficiency students. This study attempts to relate the inefficiency and the robustness of the primary commonsense conceptions by devising a noviceness index using a large number of students pre-test and post-test results on the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation. The results show that the proportion of change from novice responses to correct responses increased with an exponential regression curve, with R2 close to 1. The exponential rate of the transformation of a novice view could bring forth empirical data on other aspects of this transformation, such as what is involved in the rewiring of a neural network to build a new network.

We introduce a new tool for adoption by high school and college-level physics teachers who use a common assessment such as the Force Concept Inventory (FCI). The tool uses a spreadsheet application to create a simple matrix that identifies the percentage of students that who select each possible pre-/post-test answer combination on each question of the diagnostic exam. From this, it determines changes in students understanding of concepts and common misconceptions. For those students who selected the wrong answer to a question on both of the pre-/post-tests, we also determine whether they are moving toward a better wrong answer. Feedback from the tool allows instructors to close the loop on assessment and tailor instruction in an informed way.

We investigate student difficulties with degenerate perturbation theory in quantum mechanics by administering free-response and multiple-choice questions and conducting individual interviews with advanced students. We find that students display many common difficulties related to this topic. To improve student understanding, we use these difficulties as resources and develop a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial (QuILT) along with a pre-test and a post-test using an iterative approach. We will discuss the development and evaluation of the QuILT. We thank the National Science Foundation for support.

The PER community has produced 50+ research-based assessments (RBAs) which evaluate the effectiveness of different teaching methods, covering diverse physics topics (both introductory and upper-level) as well as beliefs about the nature of physics, problem solving, lab skills etc. Results on these tests show that PER-based teaching methods lead to dramatic improvements in students learning, so assessment can act as a gateway drug to better teaching. However, physics faculty often struggle with knowing which assessments are available and which to use in their course. We have written a resource letter in which we discuss the details of each research-based assessment, including the course-level, content, purpose, level of research validation and implementation details. We also compare relevant assessments and give recommendations on when to use each assessment. In our talk, we will give an overview of the categories of assessments, paying particular attention to those that are less well known.

Over the past several years the Physics Education Group at the University of Washington has been working to probe the difficulties students encounter in junior-level electrodynamics courses.

This talk will discuss several examples of these difficulties in the context of Maxwells equations.

As part of a larger, multi-institutional effort to investigate and assess the development of student reasoning skills in the context of scaffolded physics instruction, we have designed and administered new tasks in order to examine student ability to reason in different directions in introductory calculus-based physics courses. In these reasoning reversal tasks, two different versions of a physics problem are randomly administered to students in the course. In one version, students are asked to predict how a modification to an experimental setup will change the outcome of the experiment; in the other version, students are asked to infer the modification to the experimental setup that led to a specified change in the outcome of the experiment. In this talk, we will present preliminary results from these reasoning reversal tasks.

The Physics Education Group at the University of Washington has been developing tutorials for the junior-level electrodynamics courses.

This talk will present results from our attempts at improving student understanding of vector fields and the physical interpretation of vector derivatives.

Several studies have demonstrated the utility of epistemic games in understanding problem-solving behavior in physics. Many researchers acknowledge the issue of grain-size as a challenge when identifying epistemic games in data, but few papers discuss games with various grain sizes. In analyzing a problem-solving episode with upper-division physics undergraduate students, we explore grain-size in an effort to understand student sensemaking. We identify distinct layers of epistemic games in the episode and look for relations between these layers.

Whether students are studying classical physics or cutting edge physics, many of the same principles apply. For example, the conservation of momentum is a time-honored classical topic that is absolutely necessary to understand the products of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider. The authors have created a pre- and post-study instrument to try to determine if students are more motivated to learn about classical principles from activities which employ authentic data from current, cutting-edge experiments and if such activities might enhance learning of such classical topics.

In 2012, the National Research Council released A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas. This report synthesized the literature on how students learn science into three dimensions that should be blended together in instruction, curriculum, and assessment. This "three-dimensional learning" is the basis for the Next Generation Science Standards and researchers have recently made calls to bring it to higher education as well. We have developed the Three-Dimensional Learning Assessment Protocol (3D-LAP), which can characterize assessments in introductory science courses as aligning (or not) with scientific practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas. In this talk, I apply the 3D-LAP to some commonly used concept inventories in physics to characterize their alignment with the three dimensions from the Framework. I will explore the potential utility of these concept inventories in the era of the Next Generation Science Standards.

As part of developing a comprehensive package of classroom materials for radiation literacy, the Inquiry into Radioactivity (IiR) project has drafted a Radiation Conceptual Evaluation (Rad CE). This instrument detects major problematic categories of student thinking such as the "substance-like view" of radiation, and ionizing radiation as waves. Students with the substance-like view think of radiation as "bad stuff" that is emitted from radioactive objects and contaminates other objects when it gets on them, making them radioactive in turn. Students with this view typically do not distinguish radiation from the condition of being radioactive. Pre and post-testing using the Rad CE at two different universities indicate that nearly all nonscience majors begin the IiR course with the substance-like view, but gradually transition to a "particles-in-motion" view over time. We compare data from both universities and draw implications for teaching radioactivity.

Past findings show large differences in student ability to use, and reason with, certain graphed data. Namely, many students incorrectly assume there must be dependence between the axes of any graph whether or not the data suggests a relation and whether or not a controlled experiment was done. In addition, students have similar difficulties reasoning with multivariable data displayed on a graph in multiple trend-lines. A majority of the errors made are consistent with a failure to properly control variables and/or reasoning illogically about the data. We developed and pilot tested two different one-hour group work activities to improve student understanding. One activity was laboratory based and focused on control of variables and experimentation. The other was recitation based and focused on logical reasoning and data manipulation. Results show the relative effectiveness of the activities and suggest interesting facts about the importance of logical reasoning vs. control of variables when working with graphed data.

Prior research suggests that students who demonstrate conceptual knowledge on one task often fail to apply consistent thinking on closely related tasks. This is consistent with the dual-process theory of reasoning that suggests that some students tend to focus on surface features that often elicit intuitive ideas. As such, these students tend to provide answers based on their first reactions or gut feelings. We applied a paired-question methodology, in which screening and target questions required the application of the same concepts and skills. Three versions of screening-target sequences were designed in the context of friction. The sequences only differed in the level of abstractness that describe setups presented in the screening questions. The impact of these differences on student performance on the target question was examined. Results from introductory algebra-based physics class will be presented and discussed.

Gausss law is a fixture in introductory physics classes in part because the reasoning skills and fundamental physics knowledge required for its application represent important course goals. We have found that students struggle to apply Gausss law to conceptual questions as well as typical end-of-chapter problems, even after coverage in lecture and the relevant sections of Tutorials in Introductory Physics(1). To address persistent difficulties we are modifying tutorial curriculum to reduce the number of examples and emphasize the development of a conceptual framework around flux and Gausss law. The goal is to improve student performance on both conceptual questions and typical calculation questions. A summary of the student difficulties uncovered, details of modifications to the established curriculum, and preliminary results will be presented.

In a teacher professional development meeting of the MainePSP, teachers were asked a question about potential energy and then to discuss why students might give a particular response to it. Collectively, they came up with a rich, nuanced description of student reasoning, touching on multiple ways of thinking about energy, and how these might affect student responses. Where PD organizers (...the talk authors) had predicted three or four, teachers came up with six explanations of a particular answer. These included ideas in the literature (related to time, effort, and work, for example) and ideas not in the literature (a wonderfully compelling reverse deficit model of energy). We find that bringing teachers together and sharing student data within a facilitated community lets teachers arrive at surprising insights about how their students think about energy.

Many studies have shown that students often struggle to interpret and generate graphs of various physical quantities. This can be seen in students responses to the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation. When analysing consistency on questions asking students to select graphs of force vs. time to accompany a described motion compared to questions asking them to choose verbal descriptions of forces, we have previously used consistency plots to show that students are more likely to improve on the graph questions than the natural language questions. This suggests that students may have developed a formal understanding of the relationship between force and motion but do not apply it when reasoning about situations related to their daily lives. We expand on these results by incorporating data from multiple colleges and universities and show how these results relate to other analyses of the data.

Instructional labs are an important element of undergraduate introductory physics. Many lab activities require students to construct graphs of their data and interpret their results, connecting their lab experience to underlying physics concepts. We investigated students' construction and interpretation of linear best-fit graphs in the context of two lab activities. Students' graphs were evaluated for overall quality as well as for the quality of the best-fit line. We then interviewed students to determine the strategies used in graph construction and fitting, and to assess student understanding of the meaning of the graph. Our results indicate that undergraduate introductory physics students can successfully construct best-fit linear graphs while struggling to interpret graphs according to the physical concept under investigation. Furthermore we found, perhaps surprisingly, that the most challenging aspect of graph construction for students was establishing a correct and useful scale.

In this presentation, we focus on students sense-making with a graphical representation commonly used in quantum mechanics textbooks; that of overlaid potential energy and wavefunction plots in the context of quantum well(s) and barriers. Previous research has pointed to a conflation of the energy and wavefunction axes as leading to common student difficulties in understanding phenomena such as tunneling. The existence of this difficulty has influenced QMCS survey items and design choices in several PhET simulations. We add to this research by investigating how students use and interact with this graphical representation while sense-making. Through fine-timescale analysis of video data from clinical interviews with engineering majors in a modern physics course, we document that the inscription can play both communicative and generative roles in the student's reasoning. We report the different ways in which the inscription gets embedded in students reasoning and potential instructional implications.

We recorded pre-service physics teachers learning about the physics of solar cells. Using a knowledge-in-pieces theoretical framework, we analyze their interactions in order to make inferences about the elements of prior knowledge they call upon as they build understanding of how these devices function. Of special interest are the instances when a student makes a significant conceptual breakthrough. We find that students who combine different aspects of their prior knowledge in specific ways may be more likely to make breakthroughs. We will discuss what instructors can do to prime learners to combine knowledge in productive ways so they are better able to achieve these breakthroughs.

When students work on physics problems, certain problem features may cue specific lines of reasoning. In particular, salient distracting features (SDFs) are surface, situational, or contextual features of a problem that frequently cue incorrect lines of reasoning and inhibit the exploration of more productive reasoning approaches. A potential approach for addressing SDF-related reasoning difficulties is to target and enhance student metacognition. In the second semester of the calculus-based introductory physics sequence at the University of Maine, we developed and administered a flexible, web-based instructional intervention designed to help students construct metacognitive knowledge about productive reflection on the role of SDFs in influencing reasoning. In the intervention, students are asked to synthesize contrasting cases in which hypothetical students reflect upon physics problems containing SDFs. Preliminary data and emerging findings will be presented. *This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. DUE-1245313 and DUE-0962805.

Introductory physics students were shown an example problem and asked to recall the solution from memory over a period of weeks, with feedback after each attempt. The structure of this activity was designed to reward expert practices that benefit the long-term retention of information.

This talk will discuss the performance of a class of 15 students throughout an entire semester, as well as the analysis of four videotaped interviews.

The ability to flexibly transform between different representations (e.g., from mathematical to graphical representations) of the same concept is a hallmark of expertise. This ability is often lacking in many introductory students as evidenced by the lack of consistency in students representations (i.e., students construct two representations for the same concept in the same situation that are not consistent with one another). In this study, we asked students to construct two representations for the electric field for a situation involving spherical symmetry (charged conducting sphere surrounded by charged conducting spherical shell). This type of problem has been found to result in many students constructing representations that are not consistent with one another. Here, we present findings from individual interviews with students which suggest that students lack of consistency may partly be attributed to the type of knowledge that the graphical and mathematical contexts trigger. Using the epistemic games framework terminology, the two representations students are asked to construct (mathematical vs. graphical) may lead them to play two different epistemic games. We discuss how students epistemological framing and beliefs may contribute to their lack of representational consistency.

There has been an increasing push for the refinement of curricula in university level algebra-based and calculus-based physics classes to focus on scientific reasoning skills. There are nine recognized domains of scientific reasoning, and this study focused on the causal reasoning domain. Quantitative data were gathered from selected items given as part of the Inventory of Scientific Thinking and Reasoning (iSTAR) assessment at the beginning and end of two semesters. The focus of this analysis was to identify student difficulties in making causal judgements. Initial results from the data suggested that students entangle forward and reverse causality statements; they often selected a forward causal statement "X causes Y" and a reverse causal statement "Y causes X" simultaneously to explain some observed result.

Physics instructors generally expect students to think about the correctness and reflect on the meanings of their answers. This answer evaluation process may include a variety of considerations, including checking units, looking at limiting cases, and thinking about the reasonableness of numbers. In order to encourage answer evaluation, instructors explicitly prompt for it in class assignments. We examine students responses to such a prompt on homework and exam problems in a large enrollment first term calculus-based physics course. We will discuss the distribution of strategies students used, student performance with these strategies, and the extent to which the development of answer evaluation skills was supported throughout the course.

Improving students skills in solving synthesis problems, which are problems requiring the application of multiple concepts such as energy conservation and kinematics, is typically a key instructional goal. We have previously found that students struggle with some synthesis problems more than their single-concept counterparts in part because of difficulty recognizing all the relevant concepts or that multiple concepts are needed. Analogical reasoning, which involves practice activities that guide students through comparisons of the deep structure of physics problems, is a promising technique for helping students recognize relevant concepts in novel problems. We report on a couple experiments testing simple implementations of analogical reasoning and show that these activities can be effective in improving student performance on synthesis problems. However, we also show evidence that these activities may not be as useful in cases where concept recognition is a less significant bottleneck.

Students who demonstrate correct conceptual knowledge and formal reasoning approaches on one physics question often abandon these approaches in favor of more intuitive reasoning on an isomorphic question. The heuristic-analytic theory of reasoning suggests that the intuitive approaches used by these students stem from the heuristic process and are cued by salient, distracting features of the isomorphic problems. This apparent failure to engage the analytic process productively may stem from a lack of metacognition. We speculate that the students who continue to use formal reasoning on the isomorphic problems tend to be more reflective, analytical thinkers. In order to investigate this possibility, we have been using the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) in conjunction with a pair of isomorphic questions to examine the extent to which students reflection abilities impact performance.

Representations (i.e. graphs, equations, pictures) are the foundational tools that students use to understand and solve physics problems. This study aims to understand the purpose with which students use particular representations. In the Modeling Instruction courses, representation use is a primary focus with explicit class time spent on introducing, practicing, coordinating, and applying multiple representations. Consequently, we conducted pre/post think-aloud, problem-solving interviews with groups of students in the Modeling Instruction Electricity and Magnetism (MI-E&M;) course. In each recorded interview, students were asked to solve three physics problems, which varied by context (mechanics and E&M;), difficulty, and familiarity with the topic to show the breadth of how students use representations when problem solving. From video analysis and coding, we will present the common themes and purposes with which students use various representations.

As our classrooms become more active and collaborative, we need to consider ways that our assessments can take on the same active and collaborative spirit that our classes have. One way that has come into practice is through the use of group exams. We hypothesize that student groupings are embedded within exam response data giving us an assessment of our students' social profiles. This makes group exam response data an untapped resource that can tell us more about our students than their score on an exam. Using a duplicate exam format, we are developing a method for analyzing group formation for a particular exam using the framework of network analysis. This method will be compared to self-reported student grouping data for verification. Looking forward, we will consider questions such as, Who do I need to work harder to include in the class? and Who might make a good LA?

Peer grading of student work has been used extensively in large-enrollment courses, but this evaluative practice has not yet been deeply explored in the context of student work submitted as videos. Georgia Tech has run three semesters of an introductory mechanics course in which students were required to create lab reports as videos and post them online. We investigate student grading behaviors by comparing students ratings of peer-produced lab reports with the students online (clickstream) interactions with those lab reports during the grading process. We discuss particular features of the peer-grading process which may influence student ratings and engagement.

Students in research-and-inquiry-based physics courses tend to feel uneasy with the lack of answers from the professor or textbook. Years of traditional schooling teach students to seek answers outside of their own reasoning. Also, students tend to bring to our classrooms unproductive views of science as being about "right answers" and they discount sense-making. Despite our efforts to encourage students to take risks and rely on their wits, many students feel unease about their ideas because they are not from authorities. Martin Schwartz addressed a similar concern among scientists in his essay "The importance of stupidity in scientific research". In this article Schwartz frames ignorance or stupidity as the essential driver of scientific research. We have investigated changes in student affect that result from reading this article as a homework assignment and find that, while students often misunderstand the point of the article, their feelings about the course improve considerably. *The Inquiry into Radioactivity Project has been supported by NSF DUE grant 0942699.

Instruments that measure students attitudes and epistemological beliefs about physics often assume implicitly that physics is monolithic. That is, while there are multiple dimensions to student attitudes, physics itself is treated as a single discipline. We administered a survey in modern physics courses for engineering students, with modified CLASS (Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey) survey items in which physics was changed to classical physics and quantum physics, and found significant splits between students self-reported attitudes toward classical and quantum physics, both pre- and post-instruction. Specifically, students display greater evidence of real-world connections and problem-solving sophistication with classical than with quantum physics. We also found that, under some conditions, quantum physics instruction was associated with a pre-/post-shift in attitudes toward classical physics.

Theories developed by Tinto and Nora identify academic performance, learning gains, and student involvement in learning communities as important facets of student engagement that support student persistence. Collaborative learning environments, such as those employed in the Modeling Instruction (MI) introductory physics course, are considered especially important. Due to the inherently social nature of collaborative learning, we examine student social interactions in the classroom using Network Analysis methods to analyze a survey administered periodically in class. We then calculate centrality, a family of measures that quantify how connected or "central" a particular student is within the classroom social network. Building on previous work indicating relationships between classroom interactions and performance, we investigate this relationship further to better understand how student engagement manifests in the context of a large-scale MI course at Florida International University.

At Swarthmore College, we recently introduced a first-semester Introductory Physics for the Life Sciences (IPLS) course that draws on authentic biological examples relating to kinematics, Newtonian mechanics, and thermodynamics. Because the course is offered only every other year, we are uniquely situated to compare the experiences of those students who take the IPLS course to a similar set of students who take a traditional first-semester introductory physics course that covers the same topics but does not foreground biological connections. In this talk we draw on conceptual and attitudinal survey data, as well as a series of case-study interviews, to describe the conceptual, epistemological, and affective differences that we observe between the two student populations. We identify the features of the IPLS experience that were most salient to students, and suggest how particular course structures may have been especially important in supporting students ability to do well in the IPLS environment.

This PER study focuses on university students in the physics content and pedagogy course, Energy and Interactions (formerly Physics and Everyday Thinking). By design, this course prepares future teachers and fulfills an undergraduate science requirement, thus enrolling students from a wide range of experiences and comfort with science content, from confident to struggling. The course is driven by students as they co-construct principles from lab-based evidence. This study asks how students describe and position themselves as learners in this environment, and how their positioning changes as they engage with different kinds of activities. We analyze students weekly reflections and conceptual assessment scores. Preliminary results indicate that students are at first resistant to this student-driven model, but quickly start reporting feeling more confident in their abilities and reasoning, and begin valuing co-constructing knowledge with peers. We will present results and make inferences about how course components influence this shift in positioning.

In this talk, we analyze shifts in students identity trajectories as undergraduate physics majors participating in their first research experiences. Students in the study participated in an elective seminar in which they were paired with graduate student and faculty mentors on physics research projects and participated in a weekly discussions about research. Using video data from student interviews, classroom observations, research mentor interviews, and research observations, we study the development of students identity trajectories. Relational dynamics between students and other members of the physics community contributed to the legitimization and delegitimization of students physics identities. We highlight shifts in how students positioned themselves, and were positioned by others as more and less central members of the physics community. Finally, we draw out connections between student trajectories, and discuss implications for future research and programmatic design.

As part of their upper-division electromagnetic fields course, students work in small groups to solve physics and mathematics problems during class. We categorize their epistemological framing along two orthogonal axes -- physics to math and algorithmic to conceptual -- to determine how shifts in students' framing interact with the instructor's framing and the problem at hand. Drawing from observational video data of classroom interactions, we characterize framing shifts over 50 episodes throughout two iterations of the course, seeking both diversity of student responses and diversity in problem type and duration. In this talk, we present our framework and some preliminary results.

When using ad hoc student groups for group exams, how do students group themselves? Are there clear preferences for grouping by sex, ability in the course, or years in university? In courses with multiple opportunities to form these ad hoc groups, do these preferences change as the course proceeds? This research is part of a larger study investigating the factors that contribute to group success, both in terms of the groups performance on that group exam as well as the performance of individuals on later assessments.

P3 is a transformed introductory mechanics course at Michigan State University that focuses on the development of scientific practices. The design team, as part of the P3 course design made explicit attempts to assess learning goals that can often be perceived as being a part of the hidden curriculum or considered difficult to assess (for example: learning to work productively in a group). This assessment is in the form of formative feedback with students receiving a numbered grade and reflective commentary based around their interactions in the classroom for the week. In this presentation, case studies formed from student interviews conducted at the beginning and end of the semester are discussed to highlight how the formative feedback received, effected changes in student interactions in class. The presentation also highlights students reflections on the feedback and how the effect it had on them changed over time.

The successful implementation of mastery-style online homework into our preparatory mechanics course has been a long-term project, currently in its second year. By requiring students to perfect a single unit of defined competencies before moving on to its successive unit (with intervening narrated animated solutions for instructional support), this homework delivery method replaced traditional immediate feedback online homework for the class of about 500 students. After the first year of data collection and analysis, significant revisions were made to the systems delivery, content, and messaging. The impact of these changes and second year data will be presented.

In order to evaluate the relative effectiveness of different question formats and levels of interaction during computer-based practice, students from two introductory-level mechanics classes were trained on the concepts of force and motion as part of one of four different training conditions. The training conditions varied the format of student responses (short answer, natural language versus multiple choice format) and the level of interaction in the feedback provided (a single, provided explanation versus constructive follow-up questions). Overall, the natural language format with follow-up dialog provided the largest gains over control, with retention over a month after training. In addition, we see some evidence that the effectiveness of the different formats varies based on initial student knowledge.

We have introduced mastery inspired activities into our introductory electricity and magnetism course.

Students preparing for physics exams must make decisions on what material to study, how to best prepare, and estimate their preparedness. Previous research has demonstrated that low performing students tend to over predict their learning and preparedness. Research has shown that simplifying the reading level in texts leads to gains in comprehension as well as larger gains in confidence in comprehension. We present data where low performing students in an introductory mechanics course completed an animated video solution intervention. Participants completed a pre-test, viewed video solutions, then completed a post-test. Confidence judgements were made after attempting each problem and after viewing the video solutions. Data will show whether or not students are able to learn from viewing video solutions for previously solved problems. We also present data about students prediction of their performance. We discuss the educational implications of our findings.

First-year university physics students (N = 42) were engaged in an open-ended laboratory module of a thermodynamics course, with a focus on understanding a chosen phenomenon or the principle of laboratory apparatus, such as thermal radiation or a heat pump. In the practical investigation, students had at their disposal handheld infrared (IR) cameras. Students interaction with the laboratory exercises and oral presentations were video recorded, and three episodes were selected for qualitative analysis. Students used IR cameras in the investigation of interaction of thermal radiation with matter, e.g. metals, glass or whiteboard surfaces. For instance, the function of a glass window is to let through visible light, but reflect radiation in the IR range for insulation purposes. Students were intrigued to find black- and white-painted surfaces to have similar thermal emissivity. As an implication, IR cameras were found to be useful tools in open practical thermodynamics exercises.

Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) is an instructional strategy involving feedback from students on pre-lecture activities in order to design in-class activities to build on the continuing feedback from students. We investigate the effectiveness of a JiTT approach, which included in-class concept tests using clickers in an upper-division quantum mechanics course. We analyze student performance on pre-lecture reading quizzes, in-class clicker questions answered individually, and clicker questions answered after group discussion, and compare those performances with open-ended retention quizzes administered after all instructional activities on the same concepts. In general, compared to the reading quizzes, student performance improved in individual concept tests administered using clickers after lecture focusing on student difficulties found via electronic feedback. The performance on the group concept tests administered after the individual concept tests and on retention quizzes also showed improvement. We discuss possible reasons for the improvement in performance from pre-lecture quizzes to post-lecture concept tests and from individual to group concept tests and retention quizzes.

As part of a project to explore the varying success of studio-mode courses, we are investigating institutional barriers that may lead to different student outcomes. As institutions adopt new instructional models, some may embrace the change more slowly, such that students have the option to take courses in multiple formats. We explore the pathways of students through the introductory physics sequence at two universities that have transformed some of their sections into studios, such that students may take the first semester course in either lecture-mode or studio-mode and then choose to stay with that mode or switch for the second semester. We report on correlations between first semester student outcomes on their choice to switch or stay and subsequent outcomes in the second semester as measured by conceptual and attitudinal surveys.

At Colorado School of Mines, we teach introductory physics using a hybrid lecture-studio model. In studio, students are split into groups of three to work through scaffolded problems and experiments. We want to know whether heterogeneous or homogenous group structures yield the most effective learning in our particular context. Each group structure has its own set of advantages (e.g., diversity of understandings and skills vs. ease of communication) and disadvantages (e.g., difficulty of communication vs. potential lack of understandings and skills). To explore the answer to this question, we assigned half of each studio class to groups with mixed physics proficiency and gender, and the other half to groups with matched physics proficiency and gender. We evaluate the performance of each group type according to the students scores and responses on the FMCE, common course exams, the CLASS, and an internal survey about their studio groups.

I will report on an experiment to implement a specifications grading* approach to assessment in a large-enrollment (130 students) introductory algebra-based physics course at California State University, Chico. In specifications grading, criteria for adequate performance need to be clearly specified, and all criteria are graded pass/fail. In adapting this assessment approach to the Investigative Science Learning Environment (ISLE) philosophy, I created homework and exam questions that that tested different (sometimes overlapping) clusters of scientific abilities. Students needed to perform adequately on all the specified scientific abilities in order to pass that particular question. This allowed for a more process-focused approach to assessment while still emphasizing key physics content. I will report on the effectiveness of this approach to assessment as gauged by quantitative shifts in students attitudes and gains in conceptual understanding as well as qualitative data from student interviews.

In discussion sections of a large, introductory physics course, a pair of studies compare two instructional strategies for teaching Faradays law: having students (i) explain a set of contrasting cases or (ii) apply and build on previously learned concepts. We show that contrasting cases not only lead to better performance on subsequent Faradays law questions, but also prepare students to better learn related topics, such as Lenzs law. We argue that early exposure to contrasting cases better focuses student attention on a key feature: change in magnetic flux. Importantly, the benefits of contrasting cases are enhanced for students who did not first attend a Faradays law lecture, suggesting that being told the answer can circumvent the benefits of its discovery. These studies illustrate an experimental approach for understanding how the structure of classroom activities affects learning and performance outcomes, a first step toward design principles for effective instructional materials.

In this study, we have examined the differences of lab and lecture activities in Lecture/Laboratory format and SCALE-UP classes for algebra-based introductory physics. Also, we have investigated the effects of these differences on success and withdrawal rates, student conceptual learning as measured by the Force Concept Inventory (FCI), and student attitudes as measured by Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS). Even though SCALE-UP algebra-based physics classes show no significant increase in FCI gains over traditional classes, SCALE-UP intervention shows a significant improvement in CLASS favorable scores for both Conceptual Understanding and Problem Solving categories.

The vector concept is used in physics instruction beginning in the introductory level. While initial encounters with vectors are firmly grounded in experience, (e.g., a displacement vector in two- or three-dimensional space, with magnitude and a direction), the vector concept grows to include far more abstract ideas. As part of an NSF-supported research and curriculum development project, we have studied student reasoning across several upper-division physics courses, including mathematical methods. For this presentation, we describe theoretical and empirical views of the development and expansion of the vector concept, with examples of student responses and a discussion of implications for instruction.

Students are often asked to construct qualitative reasoning chains during scaffolded, research-based physics instruction. As part of a multi-institutional effort to investigate and assess the development of student reasoning skills in physics, we have been designing tasks that probe the extent to which students can create and evaluate reasoning chains. In one task, students are provided with correct reasoning elements (i.e., true statements about the physical situation as well as correct concepts and mathematical relationships) and are asked to assemble them into an argument that they can use to answer a specified physics problem. In this talk, the task will be described in detail and preliminary results will be presented.

As part of a broader study on student thinking about mathematics in the undergraduate physics curriculum, we report on students ideas about coordinate systems in the upper division. Early evidence suggests that upper-division physics students struggle to answer conceptual and pictorial questions requiring the use of Cartesian and non-Cartesian coordinate systems. Specifically, students have difficulty identifying the motion of objects using plane polar coordinates. Not recognizing that both radial displacement and polar angle change with respect to time for motion along non-circular paths is a specific example of this difficulty. We report findings from one-on-one interviews that used a think-aloud protocol designed to shed light on student thinking within this domain.

While there has been a large body of work investigating the effectiveness of scaffolded, researched-based physics instruction, much less is known about the development of students reasoning abilities in these instructional environments. As part of a larger collaborative project, we have been examining the ability of students to construct qualitative reasoning chains. In particular, we have been designing and implementing tasks to assess the extent to which introductory physics students are able to logically follow and characterize hypothetical student reasoning in a variety of physics contexts. In one task, for example, students are asked to infer the conclusions that would be drawn from different lines of reasoning articulated by hypothetical students. In this presentation, we will discuss the development of such tasks and share preliminary results.

As part of an effort to examine students understanding of the structure of non-Cartesian coordinate systems and the differential elements associated with these systems when using vector calculus in electricity and magnetism (E&M;), students in junior E&M; were interviewed in pairs. In one task, students were asked to determine differential length and volume elements for an unconventional spherical coordinate system. While all pairs eventually arrived at the correct differential elements, some students unsuccessfully attempted to reason by recalling and/or mapping from elements in spherical or Cartesian coordinates, only to recognize their error later when checking their work. We have documented several ideas that students use, and certain actions they undertake, while working through the task. Across-interview comparisons allow for characterization of student successes and difficulties in terms of whether these ideas are present and how they are grouped and ordered.

The Physics Education Group at the University of Washington has been investigating student ability to use complex numbers in quantum mechanics. Complex numbers are essential to quantum mechanics.

We present data from sophomore and junior-level quantum mechanics courses to illustrate some of the errors that students encounter in using complex numbers.

It has been shown that students encounter significant reasoning difficulties when interpreting and applying multi-variable expressions. For example, students often argue that because the frequency of a periodic wave is expressed in terms of wavelength and propagation speed, the frequency must change when the speed changes. Similarly, many students think that the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor will change if the potential difference between its plates is varied. In this talk, we report on an investigation of the extent to which problematic reasoning approaches are related to (1) the level of abstractness of a presented situation and (2) the specific features of the task itself.

As part of a multi-institution collaboration, we are examining students multi-step, qualitative reasoning in physics. An important part of this work is developing methods for disentangling conceptual understanding from reasoning. In this talk, we present and analyze responses on tasks in which students apply energy concepts to simple situations. One such task involves a hand moving a book with changing speed through a uniform gravitational field. Most students struggle to coordinate the energy input (work done by the hand) and the energy changes (changes in kinetic energy and in gravitational potential energy). At the 2016 Winter AAPT meeting, Lindsey described the reasoning of introductory physics students at Penn State Greater Allegheny; this talk follows up by presenting results from interviews with pre-service teachers and upper-division physics students at Western Washington University.

The national need for a knowledgeable and diverse STEM workforce is a powerful motive for improving physics education and conducting physics education research. However, there is a need for coherent models for workforce training. Some STEM advocates believe training is the responsibility of higher education, while others see industry playing an integral and cooperative role. We studied career preparation using 30 semi-structured interviews with new hires and their managers in physics-related careers. We developed a data-driven model for where learning happens and how it transfers into the workplace, and found that essential learning occurs inside and outside of the classroom (e.g., hobbies, internships). We compared our model with others suggested in literature. Workforce development advocates would benefit from a holistic training model that encompasses higher education and industry. Further, physics departments would benefit from understanding the broad range of opportunities they can offer students for their future careers.

The Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshop (NFW) does a good job of inspiring participants to try evidence-based teaching practices, but participants often face significant barriers to innovation that cause them to eventually revert to traditional instruction. Faculty Online Learning Communities (FOLCs) are year-long, virtual faculty communities designed to support participants after attending the in-person NFW. FOLCs provides participants with a community of peers and ongoing support to make it more likely that they will overcome barriers to improved teaching. In this presentation, we will analyze one FOLC communication channel: a private online message board. We will discuss how factors like the frequency and type of comments change over time as FOLC participants generate mutual trust and how these discussions support the learning that takes place during the synchronous FOLC meetings.

A Faculty Online Learning Community (FOLC) is a follow-up experience for participants in the Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshops. FOLC cohorts, composed of faculty members from around the country, meet biweekly by video for discussion with guest speakers and with each other about implementing active learning in their classrooms. Between meetings, members continue conversations, post materials, and ask for advice in a private social media group. FOLCs are intended to support faculty in meeting the challenges of classroom reform, which can be substantial even after attending the New Faculty Workshop. As a secondary benefit, FOLC cohorts have also proved to be a sounding board and discussion space for a broader range of issues facing junior faculty. Here we describe the ongoing development of the cohort formation process, with a particular focus on how recruitment and community-building efforts have evolved during the project.

Faculty often become motivated to try research-based instructional strategies (RBIS) after attending professional development workshops, but they are often underprepared to succeed in using RBIS [1]. In order to further explore the outcomes of faculty professional development, we analyze video-recordings of facultys interactions during the Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshop. We select workshop episodes using our Real-time Professional Development Observation Tool, which allows us to identify instances where faculty members are voicing their ideas and collaborating with each other. We consider how workshop leaders design decisions seem to influence facultys engagement, e.g., how faculty take up workshop instructions, make sense of workshop activities, share and elaborate on their ideas, and justify their arguments. Lastly, we discuss the potential implications of these findings for facultys future teaching practice.

During past decades, computers have evolved from useful lab instruments to necessary problem solvers. Computation has become indispensable, interrelated to both theory and experiment, as a third methodology for solving scientific and engineering problems. By comparison, its effects on undergraduate education have been large in a few enclaves, spotty in others, and somewhere nearly nil. At least a decade of research on recent graduates with physics bachelor degrees has concluded this is a significant problem. Until now there has been no comprehensive assessment of departmental uses of computation, institutional environments for its integration into courses, personnel resources to effect such change, and local understanding of instructional methods helpful to its efficacy for learning physics. This survey is now completed. We report initial results in the context of computational curricular experiences, departmental resources and plans that the survey was designed to assess; complete details will follow at the 2017 winter meeting.

Instruction that attends to and takes up the substance of what students are saying and doing or responsive instruction has the potential to transform learners participation in the practices of science, support learner agency and voice, and promote equitable participation in the classroom, while preserving the conceptual gains our field has so long prized.

Professional development workshops are a primary mechanism used to help physics faculty improve their teaching, and draw in many instructors every year. Although workshops serve a critical role in changing instruction within our community, we rarely assess them through careful consideration of how they engage faculty. In order to encourage a shift towards more reflective, research-informed professional development, we have developed an observation tool, the Real-Time Professional Development Observation Tool (R-PDOT), to document the form and focus of faculty's engagement during workshops. During this talk, I will describe the development of the R-PDOT and introduce example R-PDOT data from sessions at the Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshop. We intend this tool to serve as a catalyst for workshop leaders critical reflection and a stepping stone for future research on faculty professional development.

Supplemental Instruction (SI) is a program developed to target gateway courses with low passing rates. Students in these courses have the option to attend regular sessions outside of lecture where they are guided through problem solving and learning through group work. Each session is led by an SI leader, a student who has done well in the course and has applied for the position. Because student success is the primary goal of the program, much of the research focuses on student success. However, SI leaders also learn and grow significantly as a result of participating in the program. In this study, we have conducted longitudinal interviews with SI leaders in STEM disciplines to examine their experience in the program. We will present findings about the SI leaders ideas about teaching and learning, their growth as content experts, and professionals in their fields.

We have facilitated Departmental Action Teams (DATs) in several departments as part of a change effort to improve undergraduate STEM education at a large research-intensive university. A DAT is a working group focused on addressing a broad-scale educational issue in a sustained, ongoing fashion. DATs consist primarily of faculty members from a single department, but may also include undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and staff. DATs are externally facilitated; the facilitators act as catalysts for change by providing DAT participants with expertise in education research and institutional change, logistical support, connections with related work across campus, and a functional process for achieving their goals. Through an analysis of DAT meeting minutes and focus groups, we identify the specific facilitation techniques that helped the DATs succeed and categorize them into goals, process, and support. We discuss these techniques to provide practical guidance for the facilitation of DATs and other similar groups.

Students in the study participated in an elective seminar in which they were paired with graduate student and faculty mentors on physics research projects and participated in weekly discussions about research. Using video data from student interviews, classroom observations, mentor interviews, and research observations, we study how students' research experiences and their experiences in the classroom community impact their identities. Our analysis draws on sociocultural theories of learning to study how positional dynamics between students and other members of the physics community contribute to the legitimization and delegitimization of students' physics identities. In particular, we attend to how research group environments and a reflective classroom community provide unique opportunities for these interactions.

In this exploratory study, we investigate how tapping into students experience, expertise, and interest in music and sound supports learning about waves using musical synthesizers. Waves are at the heart of modern physics, but students have great difficulty understanding basic wave properties, even after instruction. Research shows that students who explore physics phenomena in contexts they are familiar with and interested in enlist their prior experiences as productive resources for reasoning about physics and are more likely to spend the time to achieve expert-like understandings of complex phenomena. We will present preliminary findings from our investigation.

Our group has incorporated peer review of video lab reports into several flipped and online-only introductory physics courses at Georgia Tech, and in previous work we have demonstrated an improvement in student-expert grading agreement over the course of the semester. This talk presents our qualitative findings stemming from a series of interviews conducted with our latest group of laboratory participants from the summer of 2016. We discuss student-reported attitudes toward peer review and scientific communication, and describe the features of the peer review process which students considered most salient. In particular, we find that the interviewed students learned very quickly during the peer review process that the instructors were harsher or more critical graders than they themselves were, and so developed a practice of routinely revising downward the ratings they assigned to their peers.

Mindset research focuses on beliefs about the nature of intelligence: is it an unchangeable entity a person either possesses or not (fixed) or is it possible to improve (growth)? School success and mindset have been linked. The proposed mechanism behind this link is that students with growth mindset exhibit mastery-oriented behaviors in response to challenges, such as embracing hard work and strategizing how to improve. Mindset is typically studied through large-N survey measures with context-general Likert scale items measuring beliefs about the nature of talent and intelligence. We argue that such context-general survey measures are limited in application, particularly in the context of introductory college STEM courses. We describe recent work to improve a preliminary analysis framework that we have developed for coding mindset in interview data.

A four-week-long immersive summer program for high school students was developed, implemented, and assessed. The program was completely directed by an undergraduate physics major and it included a hands-on and student-led capstone project for the high school students. The goal was to create an adaptive and shareable curriculum in order to influence high school students views of university level research and what it means to be a scientist. The program was assessed through various methods including a survey developed for this program, a scientific attitudes survey, weekly blog posts, and an oral exit interview. The curriculum included visits to local STEM laboratories, an introduction to particle physics and the IceCube collaboration, an introduction to electronics and computer programming, and creating and presenting their capstone project. Assessment results and details concerning the curriculum will be discussed.

Based on the advertisements from the PERJobs blog, we estimate that there have been at least 120 PER postdoc positions in the past five years. Hiring for these positions poses several challenges that are unique from hiring postdocs in other fields: prospective postdocs hail from both traditional physics and PER, PIs may not have been PER postdocs, and these positions sometimes require skills that the PI has never used. We conducted an interview study of current and past PER postdocs and PIs who have hired PER postdocs to learn more about hiring practices. This talk highlights some of the preliminary findings from this study regarding how postdocs find positions, what PIs are looking for in a postdoc, and advice that postdocs have for prospective postdocs.

For the last three years, the School of Physics at Georgia Tech has been preparing new Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) with a mentoring and development program that focuses on pedagogy, physics content, and professional development strategies. Our goal is to produce effective GTAs who have a positive impact on student learning, while honing the skills they need to succeed in their future careers. Approximately 70 graduate students have successfully completed the program. The content of the program is revised yearly, based partly on feedback from the participating GTAs. As part of our ongoing assessment, we want to determine the program's impact on GTAs' teaching effectiveness. To do that we performed a statistical analysis of students' responses to end-of-semester GTA evaluations. Here we present the results of our analysis, in particular the comparison between GTAs who participated in the program and GTAs before the program went into effect.

Collaborative relationships between faculty members and LAs can enhance the effectiveness of the LA model by leveraging the expertise of LAs and placing them in positions where they can co-think and co-design activities and lessons for the STEM classroom. Interviews with LAs and faculty members, in addition to video from weekly preparation sessions, illustrate the different types of partnerships that can evolve between LAs and faculty and help us understand the roles different factors play in these partnerships. We describe three types of partnerships that exist along a continuum: mentor-mentee, faculty driven collaboration, and collaborative. This data highlights the importance of student voice and weekly meetings between LAs and faculty members in an LA Program.

While our community is placing increased emphasis on supporting diverse learners, students with disabilities are rarely in the foreground of these efforts. Students with disabilities now make up more than 10% of students pursuing post-secondary degrees. Our project explores university science courses making use of active learning strategies from the perspective of students with executive function disorders, which is common in several disability diagnoses. While active learning strategies, such as studio physics, have been shown to improve learning and retention for many students, it is unknown what strategies represent support for, or barriers to, particular learners in STEM programs. Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is a framework supporting instructors to design a learning experience that enables all learners to naturally engage with the course, reducing the need for accommodations and supporting learning by all students. In this talk, we explore several studio physics courses through the lens of UDL.

We will discuss implications that researchers choice between three commonly used methods for analyzing concept inventories has on making claims about student learning. These three methods are: normalized learning gains using class averages, normalized learning gains using individual student scores, and Cohens d. Historically physics education research has used the first two whereas other fields primarily use Cohens d. Data for the analyses came from the Learning Assistant Supported Student Outcomes (LASSO) database and included pre and/or post-test scores from more than 16,000 students on physics, chemistry, biology, and math concept inventories from 210 courses at 22 institutions across the country. The three methods were compared in aggregate across concept inventories. We will discuss advantages and disadvantages of the different methods and how the choice of method might lead to different inferences about student learning in a course.

A great deal of time and money is spent on science lab courses, but there is little evidence they are providing good educational value, and there is some indication that they are not. In particular, labs suffer from a lack of consensus on goals and on accepted assessment instruments. In this talk, I will introduce the Physics Lab Inventory for Critical thinking, a new assessment under development and validation. It is aimed to assess students' proficiency with critical thinking as related to making sense of data, variability, and models and to assess the efficacy of lab courses at developing these skills. I will briefly outline the motivation and goals of the assessment, the development and validation efforts thus far, and the next steps in the development process.

After five years of implementation and data collection, authors share their assessment of the effects of two new tutorial-based Advanced Placement physics curriculua on student AP scores and diagnostic test performances. Tutorial instruction has been overlooked as a mode of instruction in high school physics classrooms. While some teachers who teach AP physics courses use University of Washington Physics Education Group's "Tutorials in Introductory Physics" as a supplement to lessons, none have designed an entire curriculum with tutorials as the central classroom activity. These new complete AP courses were developed by Gearen at Punahou School in Honolulu, HI, and based heavily on materials from University of Washington. Currently, two schools are implementing Gearen's curricula for AP Physics 1 and 2 and AP Physics C, Punahou and The Blake School in Minneapolis, MN.

For 10 years I have organized a journal club at Emory University that reads and discusses science education research articles. The club includes members from physics, chemistry, biology, math, computer science, psychology, and the medical school; it includes graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty. In this talk I will discuss how the journal club works, give a sense of the impact of this club on teaching at Emory, and give thoughts about how one might start a similar journal club at other schools.

A two-stage group exam is an exam that students first write individually (solo phase), before getting into groups to write the same or a similar exam immediately afterward (group phase). This type of exam has been shown to promote both learning and positive affective benefits for students. To investigate how group exam design---including both question design and group composition---impacts student outcomes, we aim to construct a predictive model for performance on the group phase based on the performance of the students on the solo phase. We discuss preliminary results and implications for instructional design.

The Physics Education Research Group at Georgia State University has implemented two different reforms in algebra-based and calculus-based introductory physics courses. The integrated lecture and lab SCALE-UP approach was implemented in half of the algebra-based introductory physics classes. The lab portion of all of the calculus-based introductory physics classes has been redesigned to include the use of the University of Washington tutorials and learning assistants. Although these reforms are different they share common features of emphasizing conceptual understanding and applying inquiry-based experiments. This study reveals that even though both reforms are able to improve students conceptual understanding and increase their success rates, changing only the lab portion of the class is not sufficient to affect students attitudes and beliefs about learning physics. We will compare the effect of both course reforms on conceptual learning, withdrawal and success rates, and students attitudes and beliefs.

Students in calculus- and algebra-based introductory physics courses have been shown to perform significantly better on vector addition and subtraction tasks using the ijk representation than identical tasks given in an "arrows-on-a-grid'' representation. Evidence has also been provided that calculus-based students exhibit a knowledge hierarchy, with the ability to correctly solve questions in the ijk format necessary to correctly solving questions in the arrow format. The absence of explicit ijk instruction in a typical algebra-based course may cause difficulties experienced by most physics students with vector addition and subtraction in the arrow representation to be exacerbated in the population that typically takes algebra-based physics. In this study we investigate to what degree an instructional intervention in the ijk format improves algebra-based students' ability to correctly answer questions in the arrow representation over a similar instructional intervention in the arrow format. Results and instructional implications will be discussed.

We report on the initial phases of a study to investigate how and to what extent physics majors at a small private urban university campus develop three particular metacognitive gimmicks, namely: checking units for consistency, discerning whether limiting cases match physical intuition, and computing numerical values for reasonable-ness. Students in a one semester Griffiths electromagnetism course for physics majors are conditioned to respond to explicit prompts that encourage adopting these three methods for checking answers to typical textbook physics problems. We explore the time development of student use of these gimmicks in a given course and in a subsequent course. While the term gimmick carries with it some pejorative baggage, we feel it describes the essential nature of the pedagogical idea adequately in that it gets attention, is easy for the students to remember, and represents, albeit perhaps in a surface way, some key ideas about which professional physicists care.

This study evaluates and analyzes understanding and application that undergraduate students have regarding the conception of system. The participants were majors in physics education in Seoul National University, Korea. The research was composed of the survey and interview. Surveys consisted of open response questions that concerned the concept of system and problems in terms of conservation laws. And the interview items were a definition of system and importance of system in physics learning, and what is the function of system in problem solving. Results show that the concepts of system was explained by using one or two keywords; and their explanations were not same with previous research. Participants had difficulties with considering the concept of system and applying the conservation law in the process of problem solving. We discuss the conditions of system-based understanding and hierarchy of conditions.

Understanding the relationships between balancing, mass distribution and the center of mass is challenging for students. In particular there is a widespread tendency to attribute a balanced state to equal amounts of mass to both sides of the fulcrum if the mass distribution is continuous. (1) A number of explanations have been proposed, including a recent suggestion that perceptual difficulties in locating the center of mass are, at least in part, to blame. (2) Recent experiments suggest that it is unlikely that perceptual difficulties play a significant role.

Gender differences on the Conceptual Survey in Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM) have been extensively studied. Ten semesters (N=1621) of CSEM data is presented showing male students outperform female students on the CSEM post-test by 5% (p<.001). Male students also outperform female students on qualitative in-semester test questions by 3% (p=.004), but no significant difference between male and female students was found on quantitative test questions. Male students enter the class with superior prior preparation in the subject and score 4% higher on the CSEM pre-test (p<.001). If the sample is restricted to students with little prior knowledge who answer no more than eight of the 32 questions correctly (N=822), male and female differences on the CSEM and qualitative test questions cease to be significant. This suggests no intrinsic gender bias exists in the CSEM itself and that gender differences are the result of prior preparation measured by CSEM pre-test score.

We are continuing an investigation of mathematical difficulties that pose obstacles for students in introductory university physics courses. We have documented that a substantial proportion of students consistently make errors on high-school-level trigonometry and algebra problems; error rates vary from 10-30% in second-semester calculus-based courses to 70% and higher in first-semester algebra-based courses. Based on analysis of students' responses to written diagnostics and on one-on-one problem-solving interviews, we observe that these student difficulties have three primary components: (1) simple carelessness; (2) inadequate skill levels; (3) difficulties with mathematical concepts. We are exploring the relative magnitude of these components along with the nature and strength of their interaction, in an effort to find effective methods for improving students' performance.

Mathematical difficulties of introductory physics students are well documented, but not all such difficulties have yet been carefully examined. One of the most frequently encountered types of mathematical problem to arise in introductory physics is the solution of systems of equations involving just two or three variables. For example, when balancing force vectors in a plane, students are often confronted with two equations and two unknowns, and are asked to find the values of the variables. As part of a larger study, we have developed a diagnostic that includes multiple questions about solving such small systems of equations. This diagnostic was given to over 600 students in first- and second-semester physics courses, and preliminary results show that many students struggle to solve these problems. We will present our methods and findings, including possible insights into how students approach the problem of solving systems of equations.

The Emory-Tibet Science Initiative (ETSI) is designed to introduce modern science to Tibetan Buddhist monks studying in monastic institutions in India. Participating monks are exposed to concepts of Philosophy of Science, Biology, Neuroscience, and Mathematics & Physics every summer over the course of six years. First-year students learn basic mathematics and an overview of physics concepts such as kinematics, Newtons laws, and astronomy. Second-year students learn mechanics, third-year students learn thermodynamics, and fourth-year students learn electricity and magnetism. The physics portion of the program is currently in its fourth year of planning. Here, instructors travel to one of the three different participating monasteries in India for two-three weeks in summer. This program is sponsored by Emory University. https://tibet.emory.edu/emory-tibet-science-initiative/
