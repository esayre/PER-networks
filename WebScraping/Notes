web scraping basically extracts all the abstracts from AAPT and writes it on text files in the form of lists using Beatiful soup framework. 
It took me a whole day to extract everything. To start scraping, just run the "web_scraping.py" file If you do not wanna collapse AAPT 
webpage, keep the time delay at 5 seconds. You can find all the abstracts inside the "abstracts" file
