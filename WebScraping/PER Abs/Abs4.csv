However, the individual perception of Haidinger's brushes can vary significantly, and many subjects report they can not perceive them at all. So far no explanation for these differences exists.

It would be worthwhile if students in introductory physics could prove the relation, elliptical orbit -> 1/r^2 force, without having to rely on upper-level mathematics. We introduce a simple procedure - Newton's Recipe - that allows students to readily and accurately deduce the algebraic form of force laws from a geometric analysis of orbit shapes. Newton's Recipe is based on a hidden gem in Newton's Principia - the force formula F QR/(SPxQT)2. Given any kind of orbital curve (elliptical, spiral, ?) students deduce the force simply by measuring the orbital shape parameters (QR, SP, QT) with a ruler. In our ""Orb Lab"", students solve the celebrated Kepler Problem: Given an ellipse, find the force. The class draws a large elliptical orbit. The orbit is cut into small pieces - orbital arcs. Each student gets his or her own arc and measures the force responsible for the shape of their arc. Students uncover a simple pattern in the variation of the force along the ellipse.

(2) Loomis' detector was found to obey Manley-Rowe equations for parametric mixing in time-varying media, and his receiver architecture was discovered to be reasonably sensitive (approximately 300 microvolts). (3) During actual experiments, the measured field was determined to be inverse-distance and obey conventional Sommerfeld-Norton ground-wave propagation.

In a study of multiple representation use, we gave students a total of five free-body diagram problems in recitation and exams. We studied students in two large-lecture algebra-based physics courses at Rutgers, one at the University of Colorado (CU), and a smaller course at The College of New Jersey. The courses differ significantly in their implementation, especially with respect to their use of multiple representations: The Rutgers and TCNJ courses are reformed and explicitly teach a concrete problem-solving heuristic that emphasizes multiple representations. The CU course is also reformed, but teaches problem-solving heuristics and the use of multiple representations implicitly.

The pair co-taught within the scaffolding of the PER-based course structure typically used by the experienced instructor and met regularly to discuss instructional decisions. An outsider (AB) conducted separate interviews with each instructor at the beginning, middle, and end of the semester. Classroom observations were also made. Interviews show a significant shift in the new instructor's attitude towards and understanding of the PER-based instructional approaches.",None

Whitten, Physics Dept., Colorado Coll.",<b> Co-Author(s): </b>,"Sarah K Matthews, Shannon R. Dorato, Suzanne F. Porter, Jessica A Rivas","Recently several innovative alternatives to the standard introductory physics course have been developed, with the goal of making physics more attractive to a broader range of students. Traditional physics problems appeal to traditional physics students, but may reinforce the opinion of women and students of color that physics is not for them. Sue Rosser suggests that science courses should try to incorporate and validate personal experiences that students are likely to have had. Emphasizing the applications of physics to social and environmental problems may broaden the appeal of introductory physics to non-traditional students. In this project we are designing problems that test the concepts of introductory physics, in a variety of contexts that will appeal to less traditional physics students, and illustrate the wide applicability of the principles of physics. We?ll describe our guidelines and give examples of our problems.",None

They tied second place with another group! This is a presentation of the process of preparation that is believed to have contributed to their success. The students were encouraged to make social connections in their model, such as its significance in their lives, and relations to personal experience. The girls were as actively involved as the boys, which generated excitement. The first drafts were evaluated and the reasons for success and failure explained. The physical concepts were taught after they had learned experientially. These concepts were reviewed during subsequent sessions when they were allowed more trials. The students were encouraged to use ?big words?, high-technology equipment and artistry in their final presentation posters.",None

But does physics instruction produce an improvement in reasoning (cognitive enhancement)? So far there are two methods that do this, Thinkin Science by Shayer, Adey, and Yates and Instrumental Enrichment by Reuven Feuerstein. There is tantalyzing evidence that physics instruction may produce enhancement, but the evidence is thin. It may be necessary to specifically target skills and ways of thinking that are not addressed by current curricula.",None
Session:,,Poster,Title:,Revising the Algebra-based Physics Sequence,Meeting:,"2006 AAPT Summer Meeting: Syracuse, NY",Location:,Sheraton Comstock,Date:,"Wednesday, July 26",<b> Time: </b>,10:15AM,<b> Author: </b>,"Robert A Cohen, East Stroudsburg Univ.",<b> Co-Author(s): </b>,None,"For the past decade or so, I have been experimenting with various tweaks to the traditional algebra-based physics sequence with the focus being on introducing new concepts and topics only in response to a perceived need, as opposed to in preparation for some future need. At the same time, traditional boundaries between the first and second semester are maintained in order to preserve transferability between colleges. This poster describes the result of this process. Basically, the theme of the first semester is on Newton?s laws and the power of using a small set of universal laws to predict the motion of a large set of situations. The theme of the second semester is on using theoretical models such as the atomic model. The poster describes how these themes evolve over each course while touching on the traditional concepts. Data supporting how the revised sequence improves conceptual understanding will also be presented.",None

It can be fully understood by students who have learned only special relativity, but have no formal training in general relativity. The key point is that gravity is spacetime curvature. Thus, the physics is that of special relativity on a curved surface. In this talk, I will show how black hole horizons can be taught using diagrams which show an important part of the black hole spacetime as a curved surface in a flat spacetime, and students' knowledge of special reltivity in that flat spacetime.",None

A classroom response system (CRS) helps make FA more efficient and also helps make the classroom more active. The TEFA-TL project began in June 2005, and we have started collecting baseline data from the first cadre of teachers. We will be following these teachers for 3 years. Teachers in the first cadre will begin a professional development course in August 2006, which will continue until May 2007.

It has generally been recognized that students enter physics classes with misconceptions about motion and force. Many of these misconceptions persist after instruction. Pretest and posttest responses on the ""Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation"" (FMCE) were analyzed to determine the models that students use. Responses were divided into expert model (correct answer), student model (common incorrect answer), and null model (all other answers) categories. Changes in the use of these models were used to identify persistent and non-persistent misconceptions. The effects of traditional and activity-based physics were compared.",*This work was supported by the US DOE's FIPSE Grant No. P116B51449.

In support of this, we describe the SIM within the realm of paraxial ray optics, and a desktop demonstration of the SIM. Although the ray description yields both image location and magnification, it cannot be used to calculate the focal fields produced by the SIM or other high numerical aperture microscopes. We therefore use the angular spectrum representation to numerically calculate the focal fields and their polarization components. A MATLAB graphical user interface enables the user to easily vary parameters and study the resultant focal fields in both a SIM and a fluid immersion microscope when the source is a linearly polarized Gaussian beam. We will demonstrate the software and discuss the resolution achieved by each microscope.",*Supported in part by NSF grant# EEC-0552853 and ECS-0210752
