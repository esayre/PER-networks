A physics teacher, in turn, can take advantage of the fact that by observing the bounce of a ball her students can determine the coefficient of friction between the ball and the floor. All it takes is a typical video (smartphone) camera and some standard software. To challenge the students beyond this standard exercise and to create a research-like opportunity for them, the teacher can then arrange for a ""frictionless bounce.""",None

Furthermore, by prompting students for physical explanations of results, we find that students also exhibit an equal if not better understanding in the ijk-format compared to the arrow format. The arrow format typically induces an intuitive application of arrows, often resulting in incorrect answers.

Furthermore, we found that students who demonstrated a physical understanding of the integrand, via a simple multiple-choice question, were significantly more successful in constructing the integral, independent of spatial reasoning ability.These results suggest that, separately, both spatial reasoning and physical understanding of the integrand are important for constructing integrals in physics.",None

A common approach to grading is to exploit a scoring scheme into which partial credits are attributed to distinct steps of the solution and points are deduced for errors. In the present work, two studies have been conducted to investigate whether the alternative use of rubrics may improve the grading process. The first was concerned with determining whether or not the rubrics developed for a class of freshman mechanics improve the scoring when compared to the traditional method. The second study used a revised version of the rubrics to verify the hypothesis that, with proper training, grading problem-solving using rubrics increases grading speed, agreement between graders and overall transparency of the grading process.",None

This difficulty is notably present in perturbation theory and topics in continuous media. We are developing trial activities that establish a connection between the two notations and concepts, implement increasing levels of complexity as the connection is developed, and finally allow the student to do full calculations and give conceptual interpretations of problems involving both matrix and wavefunction representations.

When looking at individual answers, we argue that current gain metrics are only valid under the assumption that there are no losses.

Our analysis is guided by an analytic framework that looks at how students activate, construct, execute, and reflect on the Dirac delta function in physics.

Instruction is unlikely to be effective if instructors do not know the common alternate conceptions of introductory physics students and explicitly take into account students' initial knowledge state in their instructional design. Here, we discuss research involving the FCI to evaluate one aspect of the pedagogical content knowledge of both instructors and teaching assistants (TAs): knowledge of introductory student difficulties related to mechanics as they are revealed by the FCI. For each item on the FCI, the instructors and TAs were asked to identify the most common incorrect answer choice of introductory physics students. We also discussed the responses individually with a few instructors. Then, we used FCI pre-test and post-test data from a large population (~900) of introductory physics students to assess this aspect of pedagogical content knowledge of physics instructors and TAs. We find that while both physics instructors and TAs, on average, performed better than random guessing at identifying introductory students' difficulties with FCI content, they did not identify many common difficulties that introductory physics students have, even after traditional instruction. Moreover, the ability to correctly identify students' difficulties was not correlated with the teaching experience of the physics instructors or the background of the TAs. *Work supported by the National Science Foundation",None

In this paper, we investigate introductory physics students' difficulties in translating between mathematical and graphical representations and the effect of increasing levels of scaffolding on students' performance. Ninety-five calculus-based introductory physics students were given a typical problem that can be solved using Gauss's law involving a spherically symmetric charge distribution (a conducting sphere concentric with a conducting spherical shell) in which they were asked to write a mathematical expression for the electric field in various regions and then graph the electric field. Previous preliminary research indicated that students have great difficulty in graphing the electric field as a function of the distance from the center of the sphere consistent with the mathematical expressions in various regions. Therefore, two scaffolding interventions with increasing levels of support were implemented in order to help them. Students who received the scaffolding support were either (1) asked to sketch the electric field in each region first (before having to plot it as a function of distance from the center of the sphere) or (2) asked to sketch the electric field in each region after explicitly evaluating the electric field at the beginning, mid and end points of each region. The comparison group was not given any scaffolding support and only asked to plot the electric field in all regions at the end of the problem. Analysis of student performance with different levels of scaffolding reveals that the appropriate level of scaffolding is not necessarily the one that involves more support (which is considered beneficial from an expert's perspective) and that the optimal level of support for a given student population can only be determined by research of the type discussed here. In particular, we found that more scaffolding may hinder students' performance and students may not even discern the relevance of the added support. We provide possible interpretations of these findings which were developed after in-depth interviews with some students.",None

Here, we discuss the problem solving performance of students in different intervention groups for two problems involving standing waves in tubes, one which was given in a quiz and the other in a midterm exam. These problems can be solved using two different methods, one involving a diagrammatic representation and the other involving mostly mathematical manipulation of equations. In the quiz, students were either (1) asked to solve the problem in which a partial diagram was provided or (2) explicitly asked to draw a diagram. A comparison group was not given any instruction regarding diagrams. Students in group (1), who were given the partial diagram, could not use that partial diagram by itself to solve the problem. The partial diagram was simply intended as a hint for students to complete the diagram and follow the diagrammatic approach. However, we find an opposite effect, namely, that students given this diagram were less likely to draw productive diagrams and performed worse than students in the other groups. Moreover, we find that students who drew a productive diagram performed better than those who did not draw a productive diagram even if they primarily used a mathematical approach. We also find that many introductory physics students in algebra-based courses struggle with relatively simple algebraic manipulations while solving physics problems but are capable of doing equivalent algebra when the manipulations are stand-alone tasks not tied to problem solving in physics.",Work supported by the National Science Foundation
