The aim of the project was to bring new and stimulating ideas to rural teachers who themselves had suffered from an unimaginative education under the old apartheid regime and who often had little or no formal training. It was attempted to inspire teachers to realize that education is much more than administering a textbook, and indeed that much good teaching can be achieved without textbooks and with little resources.

Psychoacoustical experiments in which a listener must detect a mistuned harmonic suggest that source segregation is mediated by a variation in neural synchrony within tuned frequency channels of the auditory system.

Previous experiments indicate that the CMB is polarized. This polarization gives information about the structure and components of the early universe. CAPMAP is designed to measure the polarization at small angular scales using four correlation radiometers. These radiometers divide two orthogonal components of the radiation into two branches of waveguide whose signals are later coherently compared. To ensure accurate comparison, the phase difference between the two branches must be minimal: the radiometer must be ""phase matched."" The phase difference for each radiometer was evaluated by direct measurement and by calculation of the bandwidth. Both methods indicate that the radiometers were phase matched. Phase measurements were also made at a lower temperature. Such cooling was determined to have a minimal effect on the phase.",Sponsored by the University of Chicago chapter of the Society of Physics Students (SPS)

We find that a student's grade in the physiology course is significantly influenced by the kind of physics course previously taken (reformed or traditional at UC Davis or traditional elsewhere) when other factors are controlled for. Our results show that students who take the reformed physics course, Physics 7, at UC Davis, have a statistically significant grade advantage in the subsequent physiology course. Variations in the grade advantage as a function of the differences in particular physics and physiology course offerings and analysis of the abilities and knowledge probed by course exams provide insights into how the thinking patterns of some students are changed after taking Physics 7.",None

We are now focusing more attention on utilizing student performance to quantitatively explore a broad range of issues related to active-learning approaches and the role that they play in gender equity. In class, small groups of five to six students team to complete activities designed to elicit discussion about physical concepts. As the activities were annually modified, opinions differ on the effectiveness of each variation. I used two variations of laboratory activities, one less formulaic than the other.

Since Planck relationship (hc) remains constant, redshift of supernovae measures expansion. Plotted against magnitude, results confirm density (Omega)=1, expanding as predicted.

Because conservation of energy specifies only speed at a given location, not velocity. A particle moving in one dimension can reverse direction at will if energy conservation is the only criterion. Prevent this crazy motion by demanding that the area under the phase diagram (mv vs. x) have the smallest possible value. This area equals the so-called ""abbreviated action,"" which upperclass mechanics says is a minimum for the actual motion when energy is conserved. Minimizing abbreviated action also predicts particle motion in two dimensions.

Quantum computers rely on entanglement to achieve a highly parallel mode of processing that offers the prospect of rendering certain intractable problems readily computable. This would make RSA cryptography, which is routinely used to secure sensitive communications such as those for internet commerce, readily decipherable.

The kit itself costs approximately $80, and a wide variety of accessories can be constructed for little additional cost. The advantages of the kit are many. Students use the same pieces of equipment over and over, gaining confidence in measurement abilities. The students may see inside the kit to trace connections. Electrical components are color-coded as to function. All accessories may be stored in an integral drawer, promoting ease of storage and distribution.

The package is written in Java 3D, and has a modular design, so that different models and datasets, both real-time and historical, can be seamlessly compared using a variety of goodness-of-fit measures. Using this technology in teaching not only provides students with an opportunity to explore concepts through a concrete application (space weather forecasting), but it also gives them an opportunity to explore it in a manner similar to that used by research scientists. The package is used both in research and education at the undergraduate level.",None
Session:,,Poster,Title:,Influence of Qualitative Physics Exam Questions on MCAT Scores,Meeting:,"2005 AAPT Winter Meeting: Albuquerque, NM",Location:,Ballroom B,Date:,"Wednesday, Jan. 12",<b> Time: </b>,8:00AM,<b> Author: </b>,"Asif Khandker, Millsaps College",<b> Co-Author(s): </b>,Adryon M Wong,"The current format for the MCAT puts a greater emphasis on passeges with multiple questions (about 84%) versus stand-alone questions (16%). The passages are designed to measure analytical reasoning,abstract thinking and problem solving. Less emphasis is placed on content based questions. Students who take either calculus or algebra based physics must answer qualitative questions which accounts for 33% of each exam. We find that students who do well on qualitative and conceptual questions tend to do well on the physical science section of the MCAT. We have also started to look at FCI scores and how well they correlate to student success using qualitative reasoning skills on physics exams.",None
Session:,,Contributed,Title:,The Atoms Family: You Too Can Teach Nuclear Science!,Meeting:,"2005 AAPT Winter Meeting: Albuquerque, NM",Location:,Acoma,Date:,"Wednesday, Jan. 12",<b> Time: </b>,10:00AM,<b> Author: </b>,"Jenny Tobin,",<b> Co-Author(s): </b>,None,"The power of the atom was harvested in nuclear energy over sixty years ago and currently supplies approximately 20% of the nation?s electricity needs with 103 operating American reactors. Despite widespread use, knowledge about the technology involved remains an enigma to a vast portion of the general population. Like any technology, there are costs and benefits to application, but in the nuclear energy field, the general lack of understanding and fear of radiation hazards magnify the risks and fail to acknowledge the benefits. The benefits of reducing environmental effects of electricity production and dependency on foreign fossil fuels are often overshadowed by Chernobyl inspired nuclear fervor. Irrational fear is effectively countered by education practices focused on the presentation of material in an unbiased approach at an appropriate skill level. An interactive curriculum on nuclear energy and the basics of radiation are appropriate for any age level (even politicians!) and is the only means to establishing a nuclear future. As a teacher, YOU can help secure the nuclear future of the U.S.!",None

Materials for the kits were selected to keep costs down (~$20 per kit), to provide a variety of magnetic activities, and to showcase how many everyday items can be used to explore the properties of magnetism. A listing of the materials and sample activities will be presented. The kits will be beta tested this Spring semester, with the results presented at a future AAPT meeting.",None
Session:,,Contributed,Title:,Astronomy 101: A Service Course?,Meeting:,"2005 AAPT Winter Meeting: Albuquerque, NM",Location:,Acoma,Date:,"Tuesday, Jan. 11",<b> Time: </b>,9:00AM,<b> Author: </b>,"Carrie Wallace*, Southern Illinois Univ. Edwardsville",<b> Co-Author(s): </b>,Rebecca S Lindell,"Astronomy 101 is often taught with instructors covering whatever material they wish. However, we may need to start teaching it as a service course for pre-service science teachers. In the state of Illinois, astronomy is an integral part of the state science standards and pre-service teachers must demonstrate mastery of the content prior to student teaching. To meet this need, SIUE now requires all secondary science education majors to take our equivalent of Astronomy 101. To determine how common this is, we conducted a study to investigate the prevalence of astronomy in each state's science standards, as well as how each state evaluates mastery of the content. In addition, we looked at what type of institutions' pre-service typically take astronomy. In this talk we will present the results from this study, as well as the implications of teaching astronomy 101 as a service course for pre-service science teachers.",*Sponsored by R. Lindell.
