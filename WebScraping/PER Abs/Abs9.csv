Findings suggest that classroom norms of practices were expanded through the use of iPad technology, to include increased roles of argumentation and collaboration. Findings also suggest that students were more likely to take leadership roles and teaching responsibilities within the technologically enriched classroom, ultimately allowing them to learn more physics. Videos, observations, interviews, and survey responses were analyzed to provide insight into the nature of these transformed classroom and student practices. Implications for the use of technology to engage students in physics will be discussed.

To test this hypothesis we recorded eye movements of introductory physics students on a set of problems with diagrams.

We manipulated the luminance contrast of the diagrams to produce three versions of each diagram, which differed by the area with the highest level of perceptual salience.

Second, we find that students with higher final course grades perform disproportionally better on abstract problems compared to concrete problems. Thus, from a psychometric perspective, abstract problems would be preferable over concrete because the former is more efficient at discriminating between students.

Most conventional physics representations are developed under the physical limits of pen and paper, and are not optimized to facilitate sense making among novices. When examined from a grounded cognition perspective, some of these representations may interfere with students' proper construction of conceptual understanding, thereby encouraging shallow/rote learning of physics rules. Physics rules learned by rote require a more precise matching of surface features to activate, and pose a higher cognitive cost during implementation. In a clinical study, we demonstrated that by improving the design of physics representation using computer animation, we can change the physics rules activated by students solving certain capacitor circuit problems.

UNC accepts students with a wide range of ability, so a large fraction of the pre-test scores are lower than is seen in recent published research. Therefore our students represent the full range of possible pre-test scores. Early this year we turned to think-aloud student interviews on a subset of 19 of the 30 FCI questions. Preliminary results indicate that students who score 20% or lower on the FCI are not guessing; they have reasons for their answers. Furthermore, particular incorrect answers are selected for a variety of reasons.",None

Using examples drawn from several semesters of TA interviews and classroom videotape, we then show the utility of this framework and describe instances of coordination and incoordination between TA beliefs and practices.","[1] B.T.

Peaks in I-V curve occur when the current decrease caused by electrons undergoing inelastic collision balances the increase of background current (IB) with increasing VA. The increase of IB increasing rate results in larger peak intervals at higher VA. Differentiation of the I-V curve will dramatically reduce the influence of IB variation on the evaluated results.

The process becomes involved and complicated and difficult to follow and more difficult to remember. I have derived the equation in a new and simple way in two steps. First, I find the expression of force by the relativistic way and then multiply the expression of force with the distance and integrate it from zero to the distance travelled. This two- step process is easy to follow and remember.",None

But, in both cases, the same force acts on the same body for the same distance and imparts the same speed--work done is the same. Hence, the same kinetic energy is delivered to the body. According to the conservation principle, we should get the same kinetic energy by both formulas. But, we don't get it. Therefore, the relativistic kinetic energy formula is something more than the conservation of work energy principle. We get something for nothing!

My attempt in this paper is to combine the two laws to get a modified Newton's second law. According to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, an opposing force is created when a charged particle moves with an acceleration under the action of an applied force. The opposing force increases with speed and the resultant force decreases. This results in decreasing acceleration with speed. The whole thing is explained by combining both forces into one equation, ""FORCE minus back-emf-force equals mass times acceleration,"" in place of, ""Force equals mass times acceleration.""

In this preliminary report, we will report on students' understanding of mechanics in a sports- themed introductory physics course. The students enrolled in this class were liberal arts and education students who primarily enrolled in the course to fulfill a general education science requirement. Their understanding of mechanics is measured through the ""Force Concept Inventory"" (Hestenes, Wells & Swackhamer) and interviews and is presented in this report.",Sponsor: Charles Fidler

The eddy current then produces a magnetic field that opposes the motion. Magnetic braking plays an important role in industry and is used to slow down moving parts of a system without losing energy to friction. The kinetic energy of an object is converted directly into electrical energy, which could be stored for later use. We have developed an analytical model of a cylindrical Neodymium magnet moving through a conducting pipe. Owing to its uniform magnetization, we show the magnet can be effectively modeled by two magnetically charged disks. We derive analytical expressions for the current distribution and the resistive force and compare them to experimental measurements. Since Neodymium magnets have become ubiquitous, our analysis will provide a good benchmark for experimental and computational models used in industry.",Asim Gangopadhyaya

It includes: 1) Updating the physics/science teacher education program at Guangxi Normal University in light of scientific inquiry ideas; 2) Providing encouraging and supporting environment for teacher students to learn inquiry teaching by doing inquiry and doing inquiry teaching, especially involving them in devolving and using low-cost but high education value experiments; 3) Constructing new-type university-school and extra-school educational institutes alliance providing teacher students not only platform for doing clinical teaching practice conveniently but also opportunity for trial school-based curriculum development and science teaching in informal setting. Reflection from different channels sees the promise not only to remarkable enhancement of teacher students' competence but also to closing the gaps between research and classroom, academics and practices. Some examples selected in a format of demo and video will be presented during the talk.",None

Timberlake, Berry College",<b> Co-Author(s): </b>,Christopher M. Graney,"In a 1679 letter to Robert Hooke, Isaac Newton suggested an experiment to detect Earth's rotation. The experiment consisted of dropping an object from a great height and looking for a small eastward deflection (as first predicted by G. B. Riccioli in 1651). Newton included with his letter a diagram of the path the object would take if it were allowed to pass through the Earth. Newton's diagram was criticized by Hooke (and more recent commentators) because his path ends at the center of Earth. Hooke instead argued that the path should be an ellipse with the Earth's center at one focus. We have developed two open-source computer simulations that illustrate the path of a falling object in both an inertial frame and the frame of the rotating Earth, using various models for the gravitational and resistive forces inside the Earth. We show that Newton's sketch accurately depicts the motion of the object in the rotating frame if one assumes a uniform distribution of mass and a linear resistive force within the Earth. This can be viewed as a more accurate depiction than Hooke's diagram, which fits a point mass model with no resistance seen in the inertial frame. The computer simulations, which are suitable for use in the undergraduate classroom, help to emphasize the role of unstated assumptions in scientific arguments.",None

This attraction between the charged pions binds them together. This reduces the force causing their radioactive decay. Thus, increasing their half-life. The other reason is Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction which opposes any change. As the pions in motion, tend to decay, the current tends to reduce.

Just after impact, we observe the propagation of a wave across the layer while a cavity expands around the impact region. When the cavity stops expanding radial cracks grow outwards from the impact region. These cracks have rough boundaries, as is seen for solids. Once the cracks have reached their maximal extension, the suspension relaxes, the solvent fills the cracks, and the layer returns to its initial shape.

In particular, it is uncertain whether the momentum of a photon increases (P=nPo) or decreases (P=Po/n), as a photon of momentum Po passes from a vacuum to a medium of refraction index n. We propose that the magnitude of the photon momentum is directly proportional to the index of refraction and is given by P=nPo.

Since 2004 the program has admitted 60 students, 54 of them underrepresented minorities (60% female), with a retention rate of 92%. The program has become the nation's top producer of underrepresented minority PhDs in physics, astronomy, and materials science. Moreover the program leads the nation in master's degrees in physics for African Americans, and is one of the top 10 producers of physics master's degrees among all U.S. citizens in general. We summarize the main features of the program including two of its core strategies: (1) partnering a minority-serving institution and a major research university through collaborative research, and (2) using the master's degree as a deliberate stepping stone to the PhD. We also specifically discuss the emerging core theories of the program, including (a) the concept of selecting students with high ""performance character,"" and (b) monitoring the ""second derivative"" of performance. We discuss our methods to recognize and select for high performance character during the admissions process, and how we cultivate that unrealized potential toward development of successful scientists and leaders.",None

When exposed to ultraviolet light, ZnO photodetectors respond by a primary sharp increase in photoconductivity, followed by a more gradual rise to the point of saturation. When the photodetectors are removed from electromagnetic radiation, typical relaxation times for decreasing photocurrent are observed to be in the range from hours to several days, in a phenomenon known as persistent photoconductivity. By isolating specific growth characteristics, we were able to determine several critical factors that may be controlled in an effort to manipulate the occurrence of persistent photoconductivity. Additionally, we present a phenomenological model of photoconductivity transients, in which transient recoveries are fitted with a linear combination of two exponential decay functions.",Sponsored by James C.

Launching the cart along a track so that it has an almost constant speed, and then triggering the fan for a known distance while monitoring its position using a sonic position sensor allows us to determine a relationship between the force exerted by the fan, the distance traveled, and the final speed of the cart (after the fan has been turned off).",None

Close, David Donnelly, Eleanor W. Close","A quantum wave function for a particle in a one-dimensional potential may be purely real at some instant, or there may be no such instant, depending on the potential. When the time dependence of the wave function is factored in, any function will surely have both real and imaginary parts. The complex nature of the wave function in these cases is perhaps best shown using three dimensions rather than with a two-dimensional drawing. We asked upper-division quantum mechanics students in an oral exam to show with their hands what the shape of wave functions for various potentials would look like, and how these functions would evolve in time. We analyze the students' gestures to understand their thinking; in particular, we investigate the difference between gestures that trace static structures and those that represent dynamic evolution, and how students extend mathematical knowledge from two-dimensional contexts into three.",None

Buddhism is a religion without a supreme being. Buddhists are left to work things out for themselves. The four fundamental beliefs that identify Buddhism contain no specific directions as to how to behave in order to pursue this basic set of beliefs. Buddhism is an empirical belief system. While some might object, Physics is also an empirical belief system. In Physics we are also left to work out our explanation of the physical world. It is not unreasonable that similar understandings of the nature of knowledge might occur in these two empirical belief systems both based in human cognition. Emptiness, the central concept in the Buddhist Middle Way, will be described and linked to an understanding of the nature of knowledge from 20th - 21st century Physics.","* Nagarjuna & Garfield, j.

The barrier to participation can seem impossibly high to many students: They need to find a faculty member to work with, establish an appropriate project, generate original research, and present their work to an audience of experts in a potentially terrifying oral presentation format. We are trying a format for upper division theory classes, in which we conduct weekly ""conference sessions"" to simulate conference conditions and help lower the barrier between students and conference participation. In order to support these conference sessions as preparation for real conferences, we developed a coherent framework involving many components (with detailed policy decisions): group problem sets on a small number of hard problems, condensed oral presentation with questions, and opportunities for extension of solutions to include original insight.",None

The applications range from the electronic immobilizer in cars to the recognition of people using smart cards or electronic passports. Development is extremely fast and many novel applications are in preparation, for example as replacement for barcodes. We developed an interdisciplinary physics education project for teaching the functionality and relevance of RFID technology by using data and energy transmission via electromagnetic induction and resonant circuits. After a short presentation on the physics principles of RFID technology, the students construct their own RFID chip cards. By using and analyzing these, they understand how the technology works. In addition, they get to know current applications and reflect on threads of RFID systems.",Sponsored by Timothy Grove.

Research data confirm that demonstrations have very little, if any, effect on student learning. In order to make a difference, the demonstration needs to be embedded into students' activities, such as Interactive Lecture Demonstrations (ILDs). However, a common complaint about ILDs is that they require written predictions from students that need to be marked or at least recorded for credits. We find that asking clickers questions related to the demonstration is a reasonable alternative to the standard ILD procedure. Our approach combines Peer Instruction (PI) pedagogy, where the clicker questions themselves are built to collect the predictions about the experiment to be performed. If the real-time data acquisition or recorded video is used, follow-up homework activities could be added. We will provide the examples of activities built around popular experiments in introductory mechanics.",None
