Despite the fervor of discourse taking place through scholarly journals, the system in place in the early 1900's seems to have become frozen in time. Our current physics curriculum looks very much the same as what was taught 100 years ago. How did today's traditional physics course come about and how did it stop evolving?

Because the strings themselves produce a negligible amount of sound and guitarists typically damp back plates with their torso, only the characteristics of the top plate and air cavity are necessary to generate a theoretical model that reproduces the observed low-frequency response of the guitar. We use the coupled oscillator model of Christensen and Vistisen [1] to predict the frequency dependence of the top plate mobility (velocity) and sound pressure produced by the guitar. Within this model, the two lowest resonances are the result of the coupling of the fundamental mode of the top plate and the Helmholtz resonance of the air cavity.

Following pair creation, the adatom islands diffuse into the silver surface with expected theoretical diffusion characteristics. The vacancy islands however, maintain their areas while diffusing horizontally along the surface even while undergoing coalescence of multiple vacancies. Coalescence events are governed by a chemical potential along the perimeter of the islands which results in an exponential equilibration of the resultant island toward the hexagonal configuration expected for an Ag (111) surface.

The expanded beam of a He-Ne laser was used to produce a localized electric field on bulk crystalline silicon while the sample was immersed in hydro-fluoric acid for varying amounts of time. Samples were analyzed by photoluminescence spectroscopy to check for visible emission which is characteristic of p-Si. In addition, pore size was estimated by examining SEM micrographs, which indicate pore wall thicknesses on the order of one micron, with a typical pore size of two microns or less. The physical structure and size of the porous regions were found to vary with the concentration and dopant type of the crystalline Si wafer.

The Electromagnetics Math Anxiety Rating Scale (EMARS) was developed to assess engineering students' perceived mathematics anxiety when learning electromagnetics. The mathematics anxiety is defined as a feeling of tension and anxiety that interferes with the manipulation of numbers and solving of mathematical problems. The EMARS instrument consists of five qualitatively different factors: usefulness, mathematics confidence, interpretation anxiety, fear of asking help and persistency. Traditionally math anxiety tests have been used as diagnostic instruments. Only recently, math anxiety research has considered the underlying cognitive processes involved when performing mathematical tasks. This study examined the relation between mathematics anxiety and engineering students' online performance in Conceptual Survey in Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM).","Sponsored by AAPT member Ari Sihvola, 22652"

The instructors were trained on the RTOP instrument before stepping into their teaching assignments and given subsequent weekly instruction in Socratic questioning, cognitive apprenticeship techniques, cooperative group dynamics and context-rich activity design. Differences between the two populations were examined as well as synthesis of common issues. Changing attitudes toward teaching and adherence to method were among factors examined.

A magnetic field of 8.33 tesla is necessary to achieve the required deflection of 7 TeV/c protons, which can only be generated with superconducting magnets. Beams will be accelerated in the complex chain of CERN accelerators, injected into LHC, accelerated and stored for many hours to collide at four interaction points. The collision rate is expected to be one to two orders of magnitude higher than for any other hadron collider. The nominal performance requires the operation with large stored energy in the beams in the presence of superconducting magnets with a very low quench margin. The presentation will present the layout of the accelerator and its planned performance and discuss the implications on the used technologies. Due to the unprecedented complexity of the technical systems, the thorough commissioning of LHC technical system (""Hardware Commissioning"") started already in 2005. The commissioning will be discussed and an outlook to operation with beam will be given.",None

The quantitative analysis of the amount of decay, i.e., the amount of the melted enamel was estimated using an absorption spectroscopy, i.e., calorimeter and the corresponding morphology was examined using an atomic force microscopy. Many people believe that dental decay is caused by sugar.

Wien's displacement law indicates that the radiation from the sun is emitted in the shortwave and that terrestrial radiation is emitted in the longwave. This difference leads to the greenhouse effect as the radiative absorption of atmospheric chemical species is dependent on the wavelength. Stefan-Bolzmann law provides the ability to understand the amount of incoming solar radiation to the Earth as well as the outgoing terrestrial radiation. An imbalance in the equilibrium between the incoming solar radiation and the outgoing terrestrial radiation results in a climate change with the Earth's atmosphere and ecosystem.

Rotating the magnet about an axis through the string results in a restoring torque, which when released, results in oscillations of the magnet with frequency that depends on current in the coil. The frequency was measured for several coil currents.

With the goal of improving student mastery of material in upper-division courses, we have transformed an upper-division Electricity & Magnetism course using the principles of active engagement and learning theory to guide teaching practices and the results of observations, interviews, and analysis of student work to identify common student difficulties with the content. In this talk, I will describe the nature of our reforms as an example of a what a transformed upper-division course might look like. The course included consensus learning goals, ""clicker"" questions, study groups, interactive lecture, and tutorials. We will also highlight some key results regarding the effectiveness of these reforms relative to a traditional course as well as student feedback. Comparisons are based upon course grade, exams, homeworks, attitudinal surveys, interviews, a conceptual survey (the BEMA), and performance on a post-course assessment tool.",All reform materials are available through http://www.colorado.edu/sei.

Results from a standard survey of self-reported cheating were compared with reality. The survey and the observed copying patterns suggested ways to reduce copying.

However, the search for and use of broad categorizations contributes to the wide-spread tendency to attribute singular conceptions to students thinking about specific topics. We present examples in which the patterns of student responses to motion questions suggest a significant amount of variation in the ways students think about these situations, undermining the utility of singular-attribution characterizations in these cases.

Our study describes a system for accurately determining the terminal velocity of objects (golf ball, tennis ball, and baseball) using a force-based approach. In our system, the object is suspended from a force sensor recording the force of gravity. Simultaneously, air, with wind speeds ranging from 0 to 50 m/s, is directed upward through a pipe onto the object. The wind speed at which the net force is zero is the terminal velocity. Drag coefficients were calculated from terminal velocity measurements and results were consistent with previously published values. In conclusion, this apparatus lends itself to teaching important physical concepts such as net force, terminal velocity, and drag coefficient.",None

Ten years ago we introduced hands-on laboratories that allow students to experience science in a funny way. In addition to proposals that explicitly recall the contents of ministerial programs, recent additions are laboratories that tell the principles of modern physics to classes of junior high students or the fascination of art and science brought together through the exploration of the physics in music. Beginning in 2001, we have offered to the public many hands-on exhibitions: on energy, on astronomy, on modern physics, during the WYP, and on the physics of flight in an exhibition on the history of flight simulation.",None

When possible, existing, well-tested curricula such as Real Time Physics** and Tutorials in Introductory Physics*** are being adapted. Assessment of student learning is integral to the project. This poster will provide a brief overview of the labs and will present assessment results from CSEM****. A closer look at the laboratory on the superposition of electric fields will then be taken. Documented student difficulties with superposition have been used to inform the design of instruction. Students are guided through a cycle of predict-observe-explain, using the simulation program EMField6.","*program by David Trowbridge and Bruce Sherwood, 1998; **David Sokoloff,"
