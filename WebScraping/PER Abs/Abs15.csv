This cause and effect approach supports the notion that the interaction between objects in the natural world is linear. A watch analogy is often used to describe this view. Understanding how the watch (whole system) works can be accomplished by taking the watch apart to understand the interaction of each gear and part. Unfortunately systems in the natural world exhibit feedback that produces non-linear and often unexpected outcomes. Having students model systems promotes deeper understanding. Students can ask what if questions to gain deeper insight and comprehension.

In response to this, two new generations of solar cells have emerged recently: dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) constructed from inexpensive semiconductor material and readily available organic dyes, and perovskite solar cells made from Earth-abundant minerals. This work investigates the relative efficiency of DSSCs constructed with a variety of biological, synthetic dye based, and perovskite solar cells.",None

Our device is a motorized, three-axis gimbal system that can simulate any rotational state through the use of a PID controller, and our project is to suspend actual debris collected from space in the center of the three rings and collect reflection data as it rotates. This will enable us to develop a catalog of light reflection patterns corresponding to different orientations, so ambiguous light patterns observed in a telescope can be associated with distinct rotational states. We built the first prototype of the robot and developed a working PID system to control velocity or position this spring, and will start collecting reflection data in the fall.",*Sponsor: Brant E.

In particular, salient distracting features (SDFs) are surface, situational, or contextual features of a problem that frequently cue incorrect lines of reasoning and inhibit the exploration of more productive reasoning approaches. A potential approach for addressing SDF-related reasoning difficulties is to target and enhance student metacognition. In the second semester of the calculus-based introductory physics sequence at the University of Maine, we developed and administered a flexible, web-based instructional intervention designed to help students construct metacognitive knowledge about productive reflection on the role of SDFs in influencing reasoning. In the intervention, students are asked to synthesize contrasting cases in which hypothetical students reflect upon physics problems containing SDFs.

We seek an underlying structure to these difficulties. Using the lens of epistemological framing, we mapped descriptions of published difficulties into errors in epistemological framing and resource use. We analyzed descriptions of students' problem solving to find their frames, and compared students' framing to framing (and frame shifting) required by problem statements. We found three categories of error: mismatches between students' framing and problem statement framing; inappropriate or absent transitions between frames; and insufficient resource activation within an appropriate frame. Given this framework, we can predict the kinds of difficulties that will emerge for a given problem in quantum mechanics: a possible deeper structure to student difficulties.",None

One way of stating Liouvilles theorem is that in conservative systems the dynamics of the system preserves the area of a region of phase space. Liouvilles theorem can be illustrated by using the Maxima computer algebra system to implement the non-symplectic Euler algorithm and the symplectic Euler-Cromer algorithm for the case of a 1D simple harmonic oscillator. The Euler-Cromer algorithm preserves the phase space area occupied by an ensemble of particles, while the Euler algorithm results in an increasing phase space area. This result is closely connected to the fact that the Euler-Cromer algorithm conserves the average energy over each oscillation while the Euler algorithm results in an increasing average energy. The numerical errors in the Euler algorithm behave like a driving force, effectively adding energy to the system and making the algorithm unstable. These examples help students learn that not all ODE solver algorithms are equally good while also helping students develop a qualitative understanding of Liouvilles theorem.",None

During this talk, I will describe the development of the R-PDOT and introduce example R-PDOT data from sessions at the Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshop.

Because the stars circular motion is generally unresolvable, its motion instead appears to be a mass undergoing simple harmonic motion along the line of the observer. Thus, this radial velocity method (RVM) of detecting exoplanets is an excellent method to be understood as a simple harmonic oscillator. However, whereas most harmonic oscillators are understood by detecting the change in their position, the RVM instead directly detects the velocity of the oscillator. We describe how the mass and orbital radius of the orbiting planet can be determined by measuring the harmonic velocity of the star, and understanding the forces that contribute to its acceleration.

For this, students measure parameters of a plastic boat, cargo it is to carry, and its sea, to calculate the maximum cargowith uncertaintiesthat will not sink.

One way to better understand problem solving in authentic scientific research settings and how it relates to undergraduate preparation, is to explore the perspectives of graduate students. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 graduate students to determine what problems they encountered in their research, what strategies they used to solve these, and how problem solving in their graduate research compared to their undergraduate experiences. We coded these interviews using emergent and grounded theory approaches.

We used the TUG-K to design a task forTAs that would provide information about their knowledge of common student difficulties and used the TA data and the data from Beichners original paper for introductory physics students (which was collected from over 500 college and high-school students) to assess this aspect of the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of the graduate students, i.e., knowledge of student difficulties related to kinematics graphs as they are revealed by the TUG-K. We find that, although the graduate students, on average, performed better than random guessing at identifying introductory student difficulties on the TUG-K, they did not identify many common difficulties that introductory students have with graphs in kinematics. In addition, we find that the ability of graduate students to identify the difficulties of introductory students is context dependent and that discussions among the graduate students improved their understanding of student difficulties related to kinematics graphs. Moreover, we find that the ability of American graduate students in identifying common student difficulties is comparable with that of foreign graduate students.",*Work supported by the National Science Foundation

This investigation takes a close look at how groups of students in a section of introductory physics at Michigan State University approach design problems, and how learning is affected.

Cluster analysis was used to identify distinct subgroups of students with different levels of incoming preparation for the class and distinctly different out-of-class study behaviors. Regression analysis within each cluster was then used to understand the factors affecting learning for these subgroups. Within the clusters, the degree to which different examination study behaviors, patterns of submitting assignments, and time invested in homework affected overall test performance was investigated and strong differences identified. These differences serve to partially explain the lack of correlation between beneficial behaviors and class outcomes.",None

We have previously shown that students are more likely to improve on the graph questions than the natural language questions. We expand on these results by incorporating data from multiple colleges and by including correlations between students choices of graphs of force vs. time and acceleration vs. time for identical motions. We relate these results to other analyses of the data and provide evidence that using consistency plots to represent individual students transitions from pretest to posttest provides rich information that is unavailable in other representations.,None

This apparent failure to engage the analytic process productively may stem from a lack of metacognition. We speculate that the students who continue to use formal reasoning on the isomorphic problems tend to be more reflective, analytical thinkers.
