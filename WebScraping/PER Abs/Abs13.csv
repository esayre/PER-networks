Life elsewhere would likely be based on the same types of molecules as on Earth, although these molecules would not necessarily be exactly the same ones as in terrestrial life. The origin and early evolution of life on Earth is thought to have taken place through a series of stages that resulted in the emergence of molecular entities capable of multiplication, heredity, and variation. These simple entities marked the point of the origin of life and evolution, which eventually led to the modern DNA/protein biochemistry. If these processes are common elsewhere, life could be widespread in the Universe.

Students enrolled in an introductory mechanics course were interviewed individually and asked to provide self-explanations on conceptual physics tasks. Participants worked through four sets of tasks, each containing a diagram. Each set contained an initial task, six isomorphic training tasks, a near transfer task, and a far transfer task. Students in the cued conditions saw visual cues on the training tasks, and students in the feedback conditions were told whether their responses were correct or incorrect. We discuss the influence of self-explanation on students' ability to solve the training and transfer task with respect to the cue and feedback conditions.",*This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. 1138697 and 1348857.

With progressing levels of knowledge of physics, they can help illuminate concepts ranging from the nature of fields in space to the properties of magnetic materials. A uniformly magnetized sphere has the external field of an ideal dipole despite being a macroscopic object.

In contrast, if the vanes are caused to rotate without illumination (e.g., by shaking in a swirling motion), they take longer to coast to a stop from the same initial rotation rate, with no reversal. This suggests that there is a reverse force acting on the vanes after the illumination is removed, and possibly even during the forward motion.

Although SEIs are reflective of student attitudes towards the class, it is not clear to what extent SEI scores represent the extent to which students learned content in the course. Faculty volunteers, who were recruited from a pool of recent attendees of the APSs New Faculty Workshop, were utilized to shed light on this important issue. A broader study of faculty by Henderson and Dancy allowed for the solicitation of numerous forms of class artifacts from these faculty including student evaluations of instruction and multiple-choice conceptual survey data. While this data might seem easy to come by, there is almost nothing in the literature that provides a strong signal about the correlation of these two metrics. The data indicate that there is no correlation between SEI ratings and normalized learning gains on the FCI, or other instruments. Thus, it appears that faculty receiving high (or low) evaluations from their students has no connection to how much conceptual understanding their students developed throughout the semester.",None

The universe is viewed as three regions of earth, space, and sky which in the human being are mirrored in the physical body, the breath and the mind. The universe is connected to the human mind, which leads to the idea that introspection can yield knowledge.

This is a calculus-based course at a large, research-intensive university, and is taught in a 'flipped classroom' format. The class consists of around 280 students, around a quarter of whom are female, and is taught in four workshop sections. Within the workshops, the students are seated in groups of five or six. We manipulated the seating arrangements (without highlighting our intentions to the students) such that in two of the sections, groups containing female students were either gender-balanced or contained more females than males ('balanced groups'). In the remaining two sections, groups were allocated randomly, such that there were typically only one or two female students per group ('random groups'). We investigated student performance in these grouping types, and found that female students in balanced groups outperform female students in random groups by nearly 10 percentage points in the final exam, a highly statistically significant result. Male students in the balanced groups also outperformed their randomized equivalents, but not to a statistically significant extent. Causation is difficult to unambiguously determine, but it appears that prior ability in physics, major/non-major status and country of origin of the students are insufficient to explain the observed differences in performance.",None

This study is guided by the assumption that there is limited evidence on ways in which mobile technologies support pre-service elementary teachers learning and teaching science. The MOTEPS curriculum is available as an iPad application called ""PhysicsFirst."" It provides a range of affordances aimed to engage pre-service elementary teachers in learning science content as they develop the confidence to teach science using mobile technologies. This quasi-experimental, design-based research study is conducted in two sections of a specialized elementary physical science content course with 66 pre-service elementary teachers. The experimental group (N = 33) uses the MoTePS curriculum on an iPad and the comparison group (N = 33) uses a traditional workbook. Data sources include two surveys, which assess self-efficacy for teaching science with technology and demographic information, focus-group and individual interviews, weekly observations of the class and artifacts. Data analyses include both quantitative statistical procedures as well as grounded theory techniques to understand the affordances and constraints of MOTEPS curriculum. The preliminary results of this ongoing research will be presented. Findings will have implications for pre-service teacher preparation for future use of technology in science teaching.",*Supported by NSF DUE 0928924.

Mathematically rigorous algebra-based physics is a crucial element; so scaling this solution required many new physics teachers. Drawing on physics majors would not have provided nearly enough due to their low numbers and the fact that many do not have the necessary interest, aptitudes or dispositions.

In our students' lives, we have gone from knowing only of our own system of planets to the discovery of over one thousand other stars with planets. These extrasolar planetary systems are motivating examples of introductory level mechanics. Students can apply basic physical principles to derive the properties of planets orbiting other stars. More excitingly, students can collect their own data and experience firsthand the fundamentals of astronomical observation and data analysis.",None
Session:,Astronomy in the Physics Classroom,Contributed,Title:,Using Radio Telescopes to Teach Physics,Meeting:,"2015 Summer Meeting: College Park, Maryland",Location:,N/A,Date:,,<b> Time: </b>,9:40AM,<b> Author: </b>,"Donald Andrew Smith, Guilford College",<b> Co-Author(s): </b>,Rexford Adelberger,"I will present a lesson plan for incorporating small radio telescopes (SRTs) into the physics classroom. The SRTs allow one to address wave topics, including FFT analysis of sound, light, and radio signals as one coherent package. The SRTs are operated in real time over an Internet connection, enabling students to observe live at any time of day (or weather). This curriculum has been developed through outreach to local grade and middle schools and has also been used in the undergraduate laboratory, both for physics majors and non-majors. Students first learn how to interpret sound spectra through FFT graphs. Then they explore light spectra, and finally, they use our SRTs to observe the 21 cm emission like from HI clouds. From these observations, they learn that we are in the Galaxy, and that the Galaxy is rotating (and not as a rigid object).",None
