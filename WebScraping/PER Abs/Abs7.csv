Since one pulse is produced each time a car encounters a groove, students can see exactly where each pulse is produced. Given that information and the speed of sound, it is easy to determine when each pulse arrives at an observer. Furthermore, the velocity of the source can be deduced from the frequency of the sound, so there is no need for an independent measurement of the source velocity.

The physics questions were paired with equivalent qualitative math questions asking about signs and comparisons of magnitudes of various integrals, including path integrals.

The role of physics education is to provide the mathematical and conceptual skills required to experiment with the forces that shape the cosmos. Historically, the science of physics has been taught primarily by a 'lecture-and-lab' method. This traditional approach provides the student with a structured body of knowledge essential for the work. But does this approach provide familiarity with the creative tools - the imaginative capacity - necessary to the exploration and discovery process? This paper presents an aesthetic-based approach to exploration and learning - an approach that artists have long drawn from and one that more and more business leaders are embracing. The model outlined in this paper draws its philosophical underpinnings from the science of hermeneutics and consequently views physicists (similar to leaders and artists) as meaning-seekers and meaning-makers. Aesthetic processes (specifically performing arts/drama and improvisational techniques) are then offered as prime experiential candidates for engaging the practicing physicist in the types of experiences necessary to meet hermeneutic demands - where the students natural imagination sets the stage for creative sense-making. Through aesthetic processes, the senses are stirred and expanded by the dynamics of wonder, enchantment and imagination leading to the development of a more expansive palette for deep inquiry and creative problem solving. The design parameters for aesthetic-based learning experiences developed at the Banff Centre Leadership Lab are briefly discussed.",None

Second, gains from ILDs are not affected by class size. Third, students in a regular semester have a greater improvement than those of a summer (one month) semester. Last, students from algebra-based introductory physics classes have greater improvement than those in calculus-based introductory physics classes. These findings will help future physics instructors implement ILDs in their classes and help physics education researchers better refine ILDs.",David Sokoloff Professor of Physics sokoloff@uoregon.edu Department of Physics 1274 University of Oregon

Direct instruction, and not problem surface features, causes the failed transfer. The poor transfer of direct instruction matters because transfer helps students to learn in the future and to adapt to novel situations.

If violated, a causal event could follow its resulting event, even if both events occurred at the same spatial position. However, the instantaneous collapse of a wave function due to a measurement can conflict with relativistic causality when events are interpreted classically. The conflict is especially striking for wave functions of entangled particle pairs with large spatial separations. The measurement of the state of one particle of the pair immediately determines the state of the other, and this process has led many authors to conclude that ""quantum mechanics embraces ('spooky') action at a distance"" that would violate causality. The conflict is resolved by avoiding classical constructs and accepting that nature uses amplitudes (wave functions) and their superpositions to determine probabilities of events. It is the use of amplitudes that violates Bell's inequality, even with a single (unentangled, local) beam. Nonlocality exists not only in quantum systems but also in classically correlated ones: measurement of one part can immediately determine the spin or position of the other part.

With this in mind, several home-lab experiments are presented, which allow students to: (1) measure the heat of fusion of water and the specific heat of a metal, (2) Demonstrate Charles's law and estimate the absolute zero temperature, (3) Demonstrate the anomalous expansion of water and estimate the temperature at which water reaches its maximum density. In these experiments, students use commercially available equipment and common household items to perform quantitative measurements that are comparable to traditional physics labs.",None

When {Beta character} = 1, the learning rate depends linearly on the amount of prior knowledge (cf. constructivism) and students with higher prescores are predicted to have higher normalized gain. Interestingly, {Beta character} = 1 predicts an IRT skill gain independent of pretest score. The model fits high quality data for normalized gain vs. pretest score within error.

Using a modified version of the CPU ""Current Electricity"" unit in a Physics Survey course we found that measurement of currents in simple circuits helps students think of current as a conserved quantity. However, despite comparing models of energy flows with current flows, students did not spontaneously think of two distinct ""types of stuff"" flowing in wires. We believe that concept differentiation of ""electricity"" into two components requires significant innovation by students. We developed ""energy flow rate sensors"" which enabled students to directly measure energy flow rates (power) in circuits.

Moderate to high correlations were found between the LCTSR and performance on exams, the LCTSR and FCI, and between performance on exams and completion of course assignments. Further correlation analysis using the six reasoning domains within the LCTSR will also be presented. The results of this research contribute to our broader understanding of reasoning and provide possible implications for the need to integrate more reasoning training in our high school curriculum.",None

In the classroom, the instructor usually demonstrates collision to enhance students' conceptual understanding of momentum conservation and kinetic energy conservation in collisions or explosions. The results of such demonstrations illustrate that the total linear momentum and the kinetic energy for elastic collisions in a system are similar both before and after the collision. Demonstrating the momentum and kinetic energy while the two objects are in the process of colliding can provide greater insight into these concepts. Such demonstration results during the collision are rarely described, however, because the time during the collision process is very short making the determination of the velocity or momentum of each object very difficult.

This has helped develop some interest and appreciation to the use of technology among students taking sciences and especially in physics.","Todd Leif Cloud County Community College, KS."

The second case study shows a similar construction, but of an incorrect causal scheme.

We propose that some examples of this behavior are not abusive and that bottom-out hints can serve as worked examples, so long as students self-explain.

Through examining the strategies that researchers adopted, two dimensions of change strategies emerged: 1) change strategies either seek to impact individuals or the environments and structures; 2) the intended change outcome is either prescribed or emergent. With the aid of extra coding categories, we were able to better study the differences and similarities of the approaches adopted by researchers in three different fields: STEM education, higher education, and faculty development.

Reay, The Ohio State University",<b> Co-Author(s): </b>,"Lin Ding, Albert Lee, Lei Bao","We have completed a four-year project to develop clicker question sequences for a year of introductory physics. Based on the hypothesis that learning is context dependent, we have created more than 150 question sequences containing more than 450 individual questions. Each question in a sequence contains the same concept but has different surface features. Our sequences have been validated through hundreds of interviews with experts and students, and have been used in classrooms at multiple institutions. Students enjoy answering the sequences and believe that their understanding is improved. Actual learning has been evaluated by comparing students in lecture sections that use clickers with our question sequences to students in otherwise identical lecture sections that don't use our material. Students in clicker sections consistently perform better on common conceptual examination questions and exhibit larger gains based on pre-/post-testing with concept inventories. Free disks containing the question sequences will be distributed.",None

Sokoloff,"In this study, we compared student gains with and without clickers while using the Interactive Lecture Demonstration (ILD) format. We chose to look specifically at learning for Newton's Third Law, an ILD that does not require students to make graphical predictions. Students in the same class either used a clicker (N=28) or did not (N=41; group pre-test results are not significantly different). Other than the presence of a clicker, the students received identical instruction, providing a built-in control. Both groups showed strong gains on the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE), but the students without clickers had higher gains (0.82 without clickers vs. 0.66 with). One conclusion is that the act of making an open-ended prediction has some benefit to the student, but it is not without flaws. Students without clickers were free to look at the same options presented to students with clickers, and Newton's Third Law ILD leads to fairly straightforward, nongraphical predictions. This result merits further study to better understand how a clicker effects instructional techniques like ILDs, and if the sequence can be modified to be augmented by the clicker.","(1) David R.

Developed curriculum that directly addressed these student ideas showed dramatic improvement in student performance on post-instruction testing. Because we subsequently observed many of these same difficulties among upper-level students, the curriculum was adapted for use at the upper level by removing some of the fine-grained scaffolding that was necessary for the introductory students.

Importance is never given to the conceptual understanding of those topics. As a result, students have difficulty in understanding motions like circular motion, simple harmonic motion. In this paper, we tried to explain the circular motion of a body in a horizontal plane, circular motion in a vertical plane and conical pendulum with the help of a simple instrument such as a string (inextensible) and pendulum bob as point mass. For a body that describes circular motion, an unbalanced force is required, and how this unbalanced force comes into the picture is explained.
