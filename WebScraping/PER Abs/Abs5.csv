Often the novice is unable to distinguish between the new physics and the unfamiliar mathematics. A solution is to offer, not later than the second year, a dedicated course on the physics of waves that stresses Fourier methods. Such courses have been in existence for some time, but questions linger about how to introduce Fourier methods so as to maximize intuition and transfer ability.

The transient response makes a transition from underdamped to overdamped behavior, and the resonance response of the steady-state driven oscillator becomes sharper as the source amplitude increases.

Finkelstein, Lauren Kost","Previous researchers (Lorenzo et al, AJP, 74(2), 2006) have demonstrated that the difference in performance between male and female students can be reduced or eliminated by using interactive engagement techniques in the introductory physics classroom. We reproduced this study at our institution, comparing achievement of male and female students on measures of conceptual learning in the introductory calculus-based mechanics course, while extending the work to include second semester electricity and magnetism, and student belief data from the CLASS instrument. We find that while the use of interactive engagement techniques consistently increases learning gains for all students, it does not necessarily reduce the gender gap. In the environments studied, there is a gap in normalized learning gains between male and female students (p<0.01) whether partially or fully interactive classroom techniques are used.",None

In this paper we will explore the dialectic relationship between concepts and artefacts. Although physics has abandoned Newton's absolute theological time his essentialist view of time and other concepts is still present. Consequently most textbooks in science have an essentialist view of concepts and seldom discuss the problematic nature of the concept of concepts (sic!). The discussion of conceptual change often misses that the concepts themselves change. I see artefacts, concepts and models as interdependent tools mediating the relation between a human and his/her lifeworld. The concept of time and its evolution over time is chosen to illustrate my point of view. Thus the initial sentence above could be restated as ""we find concepts in artefacts, and artefacts in concepts"".",None

However, do certain features of a problem further affect whether or not students may construct FBDs to solve problems? We found a pattern in one of our previous studies that showed a relationship between features of a problem and the number of students who constructed an FBD for that problem. For example, if the question asked students to solve for a magnitude of force as opposed to acceleration, time, etc., then more students constructed an FBD and conversely if there was a picture associated with a problem then fewer students constructed an FBD. In this follow-up study, we further investigate these two relationships.",None

For example, student responses to a dynamics question can depend on whether they are asked to draw a force diagram or write out a list of forces. It is argued that, similar to the dependence of student answering on content surface features, this dependence on the question task calls for a careful examination of the definition and nature of student conceptual understanding and provides another dimension in the measure of their understanding.

In order to elucidate an obvious pedagogical thread from the students' perspective, we have created a coherent framework that explicitly links the various course elements for individual physics concepts. Based on a new taxonomy of physics problems being developed by Teodorescu et al., students experience the same physics concept with increasing cognitive complexity across the curricular units, such as reading quizzes, ConcepTests and numerical examples in class, cooperative group problem solving in recitation, lab activities and homework problem solving. We will discuss this framewrok and present examples of such sequences from our introductory course.",None

But do they really believe the physics laws they use in problem solving? If yes, how do they believe them? To explore this question, we used a part of mechanics textbook(Symon Mechanics), the section 'the critique of the conservation laws'. At first, student wrote their answers about the question, why do you believe the conservation laws are true. After students read the section of Symon Mechanics, they responded to the question as follows, (1) Do you accept the ideas in the section? (2) Can you explain the ideas in the section? (3) Do you change your previous ideas (or belief)? (4) Does the author's ideas change your ways of studying physics or solving physics problem through conservation laws? In this talk we will report the results of this study, including the presence or lack of correlations between student's success in problem solving and their belief in conservation laws.",sponsor: Brain Korea 21 Science Education for Next Society

The approach has two primary and complementary foci that will facilitate students ability to transfer knowledge of physics to engineering applications: i. To establish the laboratory as a primary learning tool in physics at an early point in students' academic careers so that students have a taste of the excitement of science and engineering research; ii. to demonstrate the efficacy of using e-learning and e-teaching through Blackboard system. To achieve the goals we are creating a virtual community of students and faculty as a vehicle for promoting the transfer of learning using e-learning and e-teaching mechanisms. *Supported by US Department of Education grant P120A060052",None

In particular, I suggest that children, like scientists, assess the causal structure of events by jointly integrating the statistical evidence they observe with their prior causal beliefs. Additionally, I will suggest that children systematically engage in more exploration when the interpretation of evidence is uncertain, thus they tend to isolate relevant variables and spontaneously generate informative evidence.
