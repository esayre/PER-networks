I attempt to assess what did and didnt work. Methods that might be appropriate for graduate students, such as a lengthy immersion process of background reading, do not work. Rather, it is best to jump straight in with a concrete calculation. Deeper understanding can and usually does follow once students have attained a sense of mastery over some aspect of the subject, no matter how small. Mathematical ability is not nearly as important as many students think. Persistence is more important. But the strongest predictor of research success in undergraduate students is passion for the subject.",None

Our results demonstrated several broad, recurring student difficulties. To address these issues, we conducted a controlled experiment at the introductory level to help students practice the construction and explore the physical meaning of differentials. This between-students design featured pairs of similarly-styled training tasks that varied by physical context, either on paper without feedback or on a computer with electronic feedback. A post-test was given to all conditions. We will discuss and analyze the results of these studies.",None

One challenge with web-based self-study tools is that the level of student participation and engagement with these tools depends on how disciplined students are and what value they discern in learning from these tools. We developed both a set of web-based tutorials and scaffolded prequizzes designed to improve introductory students' understanding of physics.

We did experimental analysis to determine the optimal materials for a working model. The parts of the design were then interfaced with an Arduino microprocessor and accompanying circuit in order to be electronically manipulated. We were successful in modeling the trajectory of a ball bounced off a moving paddle given easily measureable/controllable physical parameters. However, we were not able to get a working model of a life sized Arkanoid.","Dr. Mikhail Kagan, The Pennsylvania State University, Abington College"

Experts across STEM disciplines were asked to identify well-propagated instructional strategies and materials in their disciplines. We created a categorization scheme for the strategies and materials and gathered evidence to evaluate the extent to which the innovations they suggested had propagated. This presentation will discuss the general characteristics of well-propagated instructional strategies and materials.

In this study of a first-semester physics course for engineers, we compare a novice instructor who emphasized the PER-inspired goal of mathematical sense-making to an experienced instructor who emphasized traditional problem solving. On the shared final exam, the novice instructors students displayed better mathematical sense-making but the experienced instructors students performed better on standard problems. We use these results to raise the hypothesis that, at least for novice instructors, courses cant always have it all; tough choices must be debated and made between different instructional goals.",None

Ninety-five students in calculus-based introductory physics were given a typical problem that can be solved using Gausss law involving a spherically symmetric charge distribution in which they were asked to write a mathematical expression for the electric field in various regions and then plot the electric field. A preliminary small-scale study indicated that students have great difficulty in plotting the electric field as a function of the distance from the center of the sphere consistent with the mathematical expressions in various regions, and interviews with students suggested that what partly accounts for this difficulty is not understanding that the electric field is a piece-wise defined function with different behaviors in different regions. Therefore, two scaffolding interventions with levels of support which built on each other (i.e., the second level built on the first) were implemented in order to help them. The comparison group was not given any scaffolding support. Analysis of the student performance with different levels of scaffolding reveals that scaffolding from an expert perspective beyond a certain level may hinder students performance and they may not even discern the relevance of the additional support.

The topic lends itself to discussion of fundamental topics in physics (e.g. modeling & experimentation, semiconductor physics), common technology (e.g. integrated circuits), and current events (e.g. raw materials and recycling for electronics). To gain practical experience, the students also build Arduino-based prototypes of a device of their choosing. Both the topics discussed and the prototype project lend themselves to the incorporation of relevant business and ethical issues of interest to the students.",None

Using physics that accurately describes real biology can reduce a course to employing equations only tenuously connected to the fundamental physics we need to teach the students. However, the act of modeling a biological process can be used as the motivation in effective physics problems that engage students in using fundamental physics. This talk will describe the construction and use of such problems.",None

For TOL to be achieved, chemical inhibitors block or paralyze the sodium pumps while the channels are electrically stimulated open. This then causes water to flow into the cell which results in the cell swelling and bursting. Electrical stimulus is an essential component of inducing TOL, so having the appropriate stimulus is essential. In this study, the electrical stimulus parameters needed to induce TOL in MDA breast cancer cells were explored. Stimulation was applied across MDA and MCF-12A (healthy tissue) cells that were seeded in 24-well plates.

However, his theory of the nature of music (1922) advanced our understanding of the physics of sound and deserves wider appreciation in the physics community. Ortmanns theory described three attributes of sound, namely primary, secondary, and tertiary. He called the primary attribute extensity, which in turn had three forms called transtensity, intensity, and protensity that correspond to the physical characteristics of frequency, amplitude, and duration, respectively. Before Ortmann, others, including Hermann von Helmholtz, recognized the importance of frequency and amplitude to the perception of sound but none so clearly emphasized the important role duration and temporal structure play. By highlighting the important role temporal envelope has on musical sound, Ortmann was helping to lay the groundwork for the emergence of electronic synthesizers in the early 1960s in which physicists such as Robert Moog played pioneering roles. By striving to delineate more clearly and fully the primary physical attributes of musical sound from the secondary and tertiary attributes that reflect physiological responses and higher-order mental processing, Ortmann was demonstrating an objective physicist-like approach to understanding musical sound that both students of physics and music should be taught.",None

Specifically, we found that the process of selecting and engaging a group of women to prepare for an international conference focused on the experiences of women in physics across the world provided a unique platform for professional development. Deepened connection with the U.S. delegates provided to be one of the most beneficial outcomes. The networking between U.S. delegates continues long after the conference and has led to new projects supporting women in physics.",None

We will discuss the benefits of mutual mentoring for career development. One of us has been a member of a horizontal mentoring alliance of five senior women at liberal arts colleges. What began as part of an NSF-ADVANCE project from 2007-2010, and continues to the present, provides us all with important professional and personal support and fulfills mentoring needs we didnt even know we had. Horizontal or mentoring is very beneficial for under-represented and/or isolated groups within a profession. AAPT has recently received an NSF-ADVANCE grant designed to broaden these mutual mentoring networks to more women faculty within the physics and astronomy communities. The project will develop ten eAlliances of five participants each among women physics and astronomy faculty who are isolated in various ways. This project will reduce the isolation of participating members and provide support to enhance their career development.",*Supported by NSF Grant Number: HRD-1500529

Feedback on the professional development workshops provided by the Committee on the Status of Women in Physics of the APS has been overwhelmingly positive. Specific aspects of what makes these workshops so successful will be discussed.",None

The selection of subjects allows for a student to specialise in one area while maintaining a broad spectrum. All students completing the IB Diploma Programme are also required to complete a 4000-word individual research project on a topic of their choice. The IB aims to do more than other curricula by developing inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people who are motivated to succeed. The study of physics, particularly at higher level, provides students with the required knowledge and skills for success at college or university in a wide range of different courses. Credit can be given for high grades in physics or based on the total number of points awarded in obtaining the Diploma.",*Sponsor: Tiberiu Dragoiu-Luca

The AP College Board program offers more than 30 courses. By taking an AP course and scoring successfully on the related AP Exam, you can save on college expenses: most colleges and universities nationwide offer college credit, advanced placement, or both for qualifying AP Exam scores. AP can transform what once seemed unattainable into something within reach. There are a million paths to a students future. By giving students the opportunity to explore their interests, AP courses can help them find and pursue their unique direction.",Tiberiu Dragoiu-Luca
