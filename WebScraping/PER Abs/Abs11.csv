A two -parameter model of usage distributions reveals that traditional course structure (few exams, other learning resources besides the e-text) generally correlates with the average student viewing less that 20% of the text, whereas reformed structure (frequent exams, embedded assessment in the assigned e-text) correlates with students viewing over 70%.

NIR transillumination was also able to detect partially fluid-filled cavities that mimic the disease condition of a large number of patients.

The study further examined issues surrounding the fidelity of implementation of IE through the use of the Lecture Activity and Student Engagement (LASE) tool. Results from LASE show that different lecturers interpret IE techniques differently, students are not necessarily engaged simply by virtue of ""Interacting"" with the lecturer and peers, and lecturers are most comfortable in conventional lecture dynamics (lecturing with the aid of PowerPoint). Such findings may help in illuminating the reasons why some IE might not work and signal issues around sustainable and successful IE implementation in first-year physics environments.",None

It is assumed that significant knowledge of the field theory is a basic prerequisite when students have to think about electromagnetic phenomena. We made an epistemological analysis of the Maxwell's field theory that show the principal conceptual knots of the theory. From the analysis we have raised questions to test students' understanding. We found that most of students failed to distinguish between field concept and forces, to recognize that field cannot change instantaneously, identifying the source of magnetic field, to confuse the imaginary representation of the field lines with real lines in the space. It is concluded that although the questionnaire and interviews involved a limited range of phenomena, the identified can provide information for curriculum development by identifying the strengths and weaknesses of students' conceptions.",None

Poor student performance on exams is often attributed to a lack of understanding or an inability to construct inferential reasoning chains. Psychological research, however, seems to indicate that thinking processes often follow paths that are strikingly different from those outlined above. The extended heuristic-analytic theory of thinking and reasoning suggests that two types of cognitive processes are involved in building inferences: heuristic and analytical. Some researchers argue that metacognition mediates the connection between the two. In this talk, we will illustrate the applicability of this theory to student performance on written questions and describe the theory's relevance to efforts to probe student metacognitive abilities.","*This work has been supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos.

Here, I extend that work along the attitudinal dimension, reporting on six years of data from the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey.

For the falling slinky the bottom portion of the slinky remains stationary until the slinky collapses. Similarly, for a spring in uniform circular motion, the spring is not uniformly stretched but is most stretched near the center of the circle. When released, it is expected that the furthest end of the spring will continue in uniform circular motion until the spring has collapsed.

However, by making physics interesting and relevant it is possible to motivate these students to cultivate a curiosity about the world which can last a lifetime. My algebra-based physics courses for pre-health majors have often struggled in the thermodynamics and statistical mechanics units. This talk will focus on two specific approaches that I have found to be effective. First, probability lies at the heart of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, but it is difficult to address the many common misconceptions such as the classic Gambler's Fallacy. A simple exercise in calculating probabilities associated with contraception provides a surprising illustration for students. Second, investing in discussing philosophical ideas such as the arrow of time helps to spark student interest.",None

It is especially important to set those expectations in an active learning physics course because they are often quite different than expectations students have upon entering the course. Some faculty members have created activities specifically intended to generate such shifts, but whether those activities succeed in generating student buy-in may largely depend on how the activities are conducted. In this talk, we will present a hypothesis based on two existing theoretical constructs: instructor credibility and face threat mitigation. Together, those ideas describe one way that first day activities help generate a favorable classroom climate. We will discuss one activity that is used in the Physics for Teachers course at Eastern Kentucky University in terms of those constructs to demonstrate the plausibility of our hypothesis.",None

I have used small boxes resembling solar collectors with a black absorbing interior but covered by materials of differing infrared transmission properties.

Through activities including lab experiments and student testimonies, our results show that the event is effective at increasing student knowledge about physics, physical science and chemistry programs as well as in stimulating youth interest toward studying such disciplines at UTPA. Due to the success of Physical Science Day, we are currently expanding the scale of the event to support the participation of other interested school districts.","*Additional co-authors are the following: Mr. Chris Smith from the Department of Chemistry at UTPA; Mr. Satya Kachiraju, Dr. Edgar Corpuz, Dr. Dorina Chipara from the Department of Physics and Geology at UTPA; Ms. Jessica Salinas, Ms. Doris Mendiola, and Ms. Karen Dorado from the Department of Community Engagement at UTPA; Dr. Maria Luisa Guerra, Assistant Superintendent from ECISD; and Ms. Connie Sinoy, Science Coordinator from WISD."

CoP integrates the learning of physics concepts with children's ideas about those concepts. The course is structured around the pedagogical learning bicycle, which bridges the learning of content with pedagogy through metacognitive reflection. As a final class project, students are required to work in groups to develop a lesson plan on one of the topics taught during the semester. In this talk I describe how we assess the impact of the class on students' PCK.

We focused on episodes during the problem solving process when experts reasoned towards a deeper understanding of the phenomenon they were observing.

I will talk about the existence of a need for universities to improve student learning in different disciplines. There could be many reasons for this need such as having a lower dropout rate, improve assessments of programs by accreditation agencies, the reception of students with different needs in the digital age, or any other cause. Among the many actions an institution can take, universities have realized that one way to achieve better learning is to hire professors who are dedicated to research in education of the disciplines. This is very positive for our community since we have seen that there have been, perhaps not the number of calls for recruitment needed, but there have been indeed such calls. This gap between supply and demand can be caused by the considerable opposition to have discipline education research as an area of research of the discipline itself. Throughout the America (the continent!), I have noticed that the ""establishment"" in the departments of sciences is very difficult to change. Professors of many years oppose that discipline education research belong to their disciplinary departments. This issue is important and we have to take action to strengthen the field and help the barriers to discipline education research disappear. As a community we should take concrete and measurable actions to make this happen.",None
