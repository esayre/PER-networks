Here, we discuss the development and validation of the survey and analysis of the responses to the survey questions of students in introductory physics courses. The introductory physics students' responses to the survey questions were also compared with those of physics faculty members and graduate students. We find that introductory students are in general less expert-like than the physics faculty members and graduate students. Moreover, on some AAPS survey questions, the responses of students and faculty have unexpected trends and should be interpreted carefully.","[1] Source: A. Mason and C.

We fit the experimentally determined acoustic and the optic phonon modes using a nearest neighbor and a next-nearest neighbor force constant.

In this talk, Scipio explores the design and implementation of a layered learning environment intended to broaden participation in STEM by creating teaching and learning opportunities for youth and adults within an out-of-school time program. She conceives of broadening participation in two ways 1) increasing participation by peoples from non-dominant communities who are historically underrepresented in STEM and 2) broadening definitions of STEM participation. Using interviews and participant observations, she explores relationships between designed elements of learning environments and participant outcomes including new possible selves and identification with STEM domains. In particular, she discusses the concept of Deep Hanging, a way of learning in practice that led youth and adults to redefine participation within the context of a design-based research project.",Dr. Ximena Cid

Coupling of two atoms, such as in the formation of a crystalline solid, results in a splitting of these levels. As more atoms are coupled, the energy levels continue to split. With enough atoms coupled, the number of levels become large enough and the level spacing small enough that the allowed states essentially form a continuum, or band. Because the electronic wave functions in atoms have harmonic oscillator solutions, classical oscillators directly mirror atomic energy levels. A single oscillator has a discrete set of resonant frequencies, while coupling between oscillators will induce resonance splitting.

(2004, 2005, 2007) demonstrated that particle acceleration in the vicinity of a shock in an advection-dominated accretion disk can extract enough energy to power a relativistic jet from a supermassive black hole. However, to maintain a steady jet, a stable shock location is required. Employing the Chevalier & Imamura linearization method and the Nakayama instability boundary conditions, Le et al. (2016) showed that a region of the energy and angular momentum parameter space in which disk/shocks with outflows can be either stable or unstable. In unstable regions, the velocity profiles that exhibit pre-shock deceleration and acceleration are unstable to the zeroth mode with zero frequency of oscillation, but are stable for the fundamental and the overtones. Continuing, we use the parameterized space for when the zeroth mode transitions between stable and unstable to explain observations of continuous and episodic jets in M87 and Sgr A*, respectively.",None

The dispersion curve over these resonances match in slope the dispersion curve for light in atomic resonances with electromagnetically induced transparency. The sound system has the advantage that amplitude increases over a resonance; therefore, no transparency trick is required. The slope of the dispersion curve is used to estimate the group velocity of a Gaussian pulse inside the tube.

We conducted structured-interviews with eight middle-division students in a restructured thermodynamics course. They were asked to determine a partial derivative using a contour map and a numerical table in a thermodynamic context. Since the partial derivative cannot be computed directly from the numerical data or the graph alone, one first needs to express it in terms of other computable partial derivatives or plot a constant pressure path on the graph using the numerical data. Although students did not exhibit much difficulty finding the individual partial derivatives from the table and the graph, they struggled substantially while deriving the above expression. They used both productive and unproductive knowledge resources including the ideal gas law, the cyclic chain rule, the first law of thermodynamics, total differentials of given variables, and tree diagrams.",None

The magnitude of current through a fan is related to the frequency of the rotating fan blades, which can be seen, heard, and felt, whereas the traditional bulb utilizes only vision. With incandescent bulbs being replaced by more efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs and light emitting diodes, students will become less familiar with incandescent bulbs. Without familiarity, the pedagogical value of using them to teach circuits decreases. Simply replacing incandescent bulbs with either CFL or LED bulbs is not viable because their brightness doesnt correlate to the current flowing through each bulb. Ultimately, small computer fans are widely accessible, affordable, and easy to use. These qualities make them an ideal replacement for incandescent light bulbs while, at the same time, keeping alive the pedagogical spirit that makes bulbs so successful.",None

Normalized gains improved rapidly in the first two years of the SCALE-UP implementation and remained relatively constant over the later years. By comparison, normalized gains increased slowly over seven years in the traditional classes, and have become similar to the gains of SCALE-UP classes in the last two years. We hypothesized that the reason behind this similarity was that instructors employed active learning strategies in their traditional classrooms similar to those used in SCALE-UP classes. To investigate this we have administered a web-based survey for instructors who teach both classes.
