Flat planar ribbons of parallel-running scintillating fibers are used as position-sensing detectors for charged particles in a variety of fields of interest to students, including cosmic ray astrophysics, particle physics and medical physics.

We began by modeling the AFM characterization technique to find a closer approximation for the roughness of our surface. Three different methods: the Debye-Waller scalar correction factor, the Nevot-Croce scalar correction factor, and a finite-difference approximation were tested to see how well they corrected reflectance for the surface roughness.

An integral component of a student's professional development is the opportunity to participate in a range of research activities and work in collaboration---both as a mentor and a junior researcher. In order to coordinate and facilitate these opportunities we established an ongoing research project looking at student understanding of the physics underlying everyday electrical devices. This study utilized an integrated methodological and administrative framework---combining elements from grounded theory, phenomenology and action research. This methodological framework provides a forum and research setting allowing junior and experienced researchers to act in various project management roles and perform a range of research activities. We will conclude the presentation by reflecting upon our experiences.",*Supported in part by NSF grant REC-0133621

A simple theoretical model has been proposed based on the Faraday's and Ampere's laws, and analytical expression has been deduced to explain the experimental results. A new explaination based on the interaction of eddy current and horizontal component of magnetic field is given for the rotation problem in all moving metal plate and static magnetic field experiment approaches met. Systematic experiments were performed with home-developed apparatus and the results agree well with the theoretical model.

Deformations of the ground surface, known as frost heave, are driven by powerful forces within premelted liquid films. These are thin (typically nm-scale) layers of melt that separate the ice surfaces from foreign substrates. Premelting dynamics have impressive macroscopic consequences for such diverse phenomena as the sliding of glaciers, chemical uptake on atmospheric ice particles, the scintering of snow fields, the electrification of thunder clouds, and frost heave itself.

The spatial patterns of greenhouse warming in global climate models contain a strong signature of this feedback. The signal extends to projected changes of sea-level pressure and precipitation. In addition, the upper soil layers are prone to permafrost degradation as the longer snow-free season enhances the depth and warming of the summer thaw (active) layer.

Firstly, e-education is not applicable for those who have no knowledge of information technologies. And secondly, there is a complex combination of distrust to current education system due to decreasing quality of it, and initial ignorance of e-learning. In a flash, universities were among the first who adapted e-learning. Trying to copy international teaching practices, but with limited resources, they basically helped to create an economic gap and polarize Kazakhstan society into those who have access to information versus non-users, as in the H.G.

To facilitate this school transformation it is mandatory to improve teacher preparation in two fundamental aspects: content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge. We advocate that both objectives should always be present in an integrated form in development courses for in-service teachers. We report here on the improvement that can be obtained in the conceptual understanding of basic mechanics principles by in-service teachers attending a 3-day short development course held in Monterrey, Mexico. Using the FCI as the measuring instrument, we analyze the gain in understanding of the different dimensions of the concepts of force and motion, and how these gains can be related to ""Tutorials in Introductory Physics,"" the teaching strategy proposed in the course.",None

As teachers of undergraduates, we cannot provide such experience for our students. However, we can ask: What skills are learned on the job that we are not currently instilling in our students? One skill developed on the job, but not taught at academic institutions, is the ability to effectively work in heterogeneous groups. Thus, a gap exists in the training of undergraduate scientists and engineers: The curriculum fails to cultivate realistic team-skills like those developed at the workplace. We describe the design and implementation of our Hierarchical Learning Ensemble (HLE) model, a pedagogy that assembles interdisciplinary teams of graduate, undergraduate, and secondary-level students to solve science and engineering problems. Our goal is to sensitize undergraduates to working in heterogeneous groups and thus better prepare them for the workplace.",None

The findings have guided the development of a tutorial that helps students better understand the purpose and functions of the angular momentum concept.,*Supported in part by NSF

Using a difficulty measuring algorithm [hints + 0.248*(incorrect responses) + 0.025*Ln(time to completion)] optimized for the split-half reliability we find that the average difficulty that a student experiences in doing a problem correlates with their ""expertise"" measured by the CLASS (Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey) at 0.36. We find that most problems are easier for experts and others much less so (or are even easier for novices). We will exhibit examples of each type of problem and will suggest that teachers avoid the use of problems that are easier for novices to solve since this can not encourage expert behavior.",None

New laser emissions were discovered in the short-wavelength portion of the far-infrared region. A three-laser heterodyne system was then assembled to measure the frequencies of these laser emissions to fractional uncertainties of a few parts in ten million. Once measured, these laser lines can be used as sources of far-infrared radiation for the investigation of unstable molecular species with the laser magnetic resonance (LMR) spectroscopic technique. LMR systems at the University of Wisconsin<0x2013>La Crosse as well as Oxford University, England, have been used to investigate such species.

It is often presumed that there is a correlation between the ability to explain information and one's understanding of that information, as giving an explanation may require reflection on content knowledge (this presumption is being challenged by the authors as part of an ongoing study). The question thus arises: If a student explains his or her solution to a problem, will this affect his or her ability to judge the correctness of the solution? Will students know whether their solution is correct if writing an explanation forces them to reflect upon that solution? A preliminary experiment that studies the effect of writing on students' ability to self-assess their understanding in the context of problem solving is presented in this poster.",None
