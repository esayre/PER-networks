According to the equivalence principle space-time and gravitational field do not exist side by side but are part of one entity, nowadays called the inertio-gravitational field. The unification of electric and magnetic field led Einstein to the relativity of all uniform motion.

Torsional strain in over- or underwound molecules was used to power the rotation of submicron beads that served as calibrated viscous loads. We tested the linearity of DNA's twist elasticity, directly measured the torsional modulus (finding a value 40% higher than widely used), characterized torque-induced structural transitions, and established a framework for future assays of torque and twist generation by DNA-dependent enzymes.

To investigate students' uses and interpretations of representations in collaborative problem solving, two groups of four freshman students were observed and videotaped as they studied simple harmonic motion. The analysis revealed three different uses of representations: answering, communicating, and explaining. The results also showed that the nature of problem and problem-solving context played an important role in the interpretation of representations.",None

These will be discussed in terms of their effectiveness and impact on the educational scene. A model that addresses the essential issues will be described. In this mode, curriculum development is regarded as a continuous long term process, consisting of four interactive components: Creation of the learning materials and the learning and teaching strategies, their Implementation in the schools, Evaluation of the different stages of creation and implementation, and Research, which focuses on student and teacher needs, abilities and knowledge acquisition processes, examines the curriculum and teaching strategies, and is used as a basis for planning and refining the other components.

The student explanation about the result, which does not correspond with their preconception of the inquiry experiment, will be guided by the assumption that the student fundamentally behaves like a scientist. Historically, when scientists find a phenomenon that goes against current theories, they either: ignored the experimental result, accepted the experimental result and abandoned the old theories, or did not abandon the old theories but made another new theory. Comparing the two, we found that the type of student conceptual change is similar to the development type of scientist theories.

Organic chemistry has focused on the synthesis of these molecules, along with the ability to predict and control their properties. Chiral molecules are predominantly found in pharmaceutical chemistry, where it is sometimes necessary to control the absolute configuration of the molecule. Experimentally, reliably determining the absolute configuration of a chiral molecule is usually done by X-ray crystallography or circular dichroism. Knowing the optical rotation of a chiral molecule also allows for the determination of the absolute configuration. Determining this experimentally has become routine chemical technique, however, theoretical calculation of optical rotation has proven to be more challenging. Recently, we have developed a new series of programs for computationally computing the frequency-dependent optical rotation of a molecule using coupled cluster linear response theory. In this talk, we utilize this new computational technique to theoretically predict the optical rotation of several chiral molecules including S-methyoxirane,(R)-3-chloro-1-butene, [4]triangulane, and (R)-3-butyl-2-ol.",None

However, many institutions do not have graduate student support available. This is certainly true at community colleges. In other cases, the typical small class size is prohibitive.

First, the students are focused on your subject matter and what you want them to learn, and not on a hodgepodge of other topics of their own choice. Second, the students will assume they can learn your subject matter because you are convinced they can, and so, they are learning it. Lastly, student naps, departures, and disruptions disappear. How do we as teachers accomplish effective classroom management? Through the application of several research- and experience-based tactics, and that's what this presentation is about for teaching in high schools and beginning college years. Here are just a few of the topics that will be explained and illustrated. Be in charge (e.g.,stand, you're taller than anyone who is seated), hand out an agenda of the session's activities, set ground rules for participation.

The marketing approach sees the needs of the student as the motor that drives the process of learning, and insists that a direct and continuous connection with the student is maintained. Naturally, some physics teachers are inclined to adhere to the old and familiar, to focus on content and the way it is presented to a large audience, while ignoring the importance of how information flows back to them from the learners.

From data obtained with a 50 meter wind monitoring tower a model of the wind shear for the local terrain was obtained. This model was applied to wind speeds measured with other monitors over the last several years and at several locations to extrapolate the wind speeds at the height of the proposed wind turbine. Using the power versus wind speed curve for a proposed wind turbine and the extrapolated wind speeds, an estimate of the power production for the last several years was made. We will discuss the measurements and models used, and how they point to the feasibility of wind power as a viable source for Gustavus' energy needs.",None
