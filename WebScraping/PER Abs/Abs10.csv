This data was collected through focus groups of both physics majors and science and math majors who said they would not major in physics if you held a gun to their head. Rice went on to conduct focus groups, write marketing plans, and create campaigns for four more university physics departments. He has also conducted focus groups at community colleges and high schools. In part, the data collected revealed: 1. Though high school students taking advanced science classes rate their high school physics highly, less than five percent will choose to major in physics. 2. 80 percent of senior physics majors cannot name three careers that can be pursued with a physics background other than teaching at a university and conducting research 3. At California State University San Marcos, 60 percent of STEM majors said they did not feel like they were aware of all the careers associated with their majors; 53 percent said if they knew about other careers associated with math and science majors they would consider something other than their current major and 84 percent said seeing research first hand would affect their choice of major to some degree. This presentation will provide specific suggestions and strategies to high school and college physics educators about how to communicate messages that will help students ensure that they get what they want from physics and everything the academic pursuit has to offer.

Then physics educators and physics teachers developed an 'alliance' to consult and prescribe each other with the purpose of improving physics teaching through cooperation. This cooperation does happen practically onsite where physics teachers reflect on what they wanted to improve, what they improved, and what they would improve in the next class through realistic approach.

Hooke claimed success but his contemporaries were skeptical. Almost 60 years later James Bradley discovered the aberration of starlight and conclusively showed that Hooke could not possibly have detected the parallax of gamma Draconis. Bradley also showed that Hooke had not simply misinterpreted a detection of aberration (although later astronomers, like John Flamsteed, had done so).

An analogy with atomic theory clarifies my argument. Even without identifying specific atoms, atomic theory helps explain phenomena such as why the pressure of a gas increases with temperature. But other phenomena, such as the relative stabilities of different chemical bonds, cannot be explained without identifying and characterizing particular atoms in detail. Similarly, thinking in terms of the resources framework without identifying specific resources ""like thinking in terms of atomic theory without identifying specific atoms"" is generative for addressing some research questions but not others.

We have constructed a relatively inexpensive 12 GHz radiometer as an optional experiment for an advanced undergraduate lab to demonstrate this radiation and the basic principles of detection. The radiometer consists of a narrow beam horn coupled to a low noise amplifier followed by a diode detector all supported on a simple alt-az mount. Detection is inferred from careful comparisons with room temperature and liquid nitrogen baths as well as the variation of signal with zenith angle.,Sponsored by Ramon Torres-Isea.

So, how should instructors interpret expressions of confusion? During two semesters of introductory physics involving Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) and research-based reading materials, we evaluated performance on reading assignments while simultaneously measuring students' self-assessment of their confusion over the material. We examined the relationship between confusion and performance, confidence in reasoning, pre-course self-efficacy and other measures of engagement. We find that expressions of confusion are negatively related to initial performance, confidence in reasoning and self-efficacy, but positively related to final performance when all factors are considered simultaneously. In other words, we are able to identify and largely isolate a productive role of confusion. Ultimately, this approach allows instructors to assess students' metacognition and perhaps even promote such constructive confusion.",None

In this talk, we focus on classroom examples in which teachers support students in engaging in feisty debate over competing ideas and in experiencing frustration as part of the process of and motivation for discovery. We consider how these affectively charged experiences may actually turn some students on to science, and we stress the need to assess the potential productivity of such experiences for student engagement and learning on a case-by-case basis.

We also show the disproportionate effects of children on women physicists' careers. Cultural expectations about home and family are difficult to change. However, for women to have successful outcomes and advance in physics, they must have equal access to resources and opportunities.",Sponsored by: Ramn Steven Barthelemy

Students are continually engaged in scientific practices, starting with anchoring experiments that contextualize four common patterns in physics: linear, quadratic, inverse and inverse square. Inquiry and engineering experiences serve to spiral the anchoring patterns with new physics concepts, developing conceptual, graphical, and symbolic understanding. Each experiment begins with an initial guess that is contrasted with a data-informed prediction, found by extrapolation of the pattern in the data. This allows students to explicitly compare low- to high-evidence predictions and builds an experiential case for why we engage in scientific practices.

Students are novices in both of these areas and so require assistance in developing these important behaviours. We have recently studied if, when, and how students reflect during physics labs. Our work showed that while many students were able to reflect on their results and correct systematic errors when two nominally equivalent measurements differed from one another by about 30%, very few would make corrections when the difference was only about 5%. Rather than confront the discrepancy, students often would simply increase their stated uncertainties to reflect the inaccuracy, so that 5% was not a significant difference.

When similar questions from an existing diagnostic [1] are used, however, 85-90% of students correctly identify the density of a piece of wood and of a diamond as fixed values. In this paper we discuss the differences between these questions and how those differences affect student responses.","[1] http://physics.fullerton.edu/~mloverud/densitysurvey.pdf. R. Yeend, M.

The four training conditions were constructed in a 2x2 design (abstract vs. concrete contexts) x (acceleration-velocity vs. force-velocity question types), and a control (no training) was also included. We found that all training conditions significantly improved performance on all question types compared to control, however acceleration-velocity training resulted in higher performance on all question types compared to force-velocity training. Additionally we found that the degree of abstraction of the training (that is, the number of concrete details included in the example) has no significant effects on student scores.

Furthermore, a portable eTALK lab does not sacrifice the important real-time TA interactions that characterize traditional lab courses and are often missing in endeavors to develop distance learning labs.

Using these one-way communication mechanisms, they focus on telling other educators why lectures don't work, explaining their new methods, giving data on effectiveness of their new method, and sharing materials that others can use. Four findings from interviews with 35 faculty members from across the country suggest needed changes to this strategy: 1) Innovations often spread through informal interactions, 2) Adopters and educational researchers don't share a common understanding about innovations, 3) Faculty adopting innovations sometimes modify them without understanding the underlying motivation and structure, and 4) Depending on where faculty are in either adopting or adapting a new way of teaching, educators may see aspects of the innovation as either a barrier or a motivator.",None

However, ice albedo has a spectral dependence, so the ice-albedo feedback mechanism on a planet is sensitive to the wavelength of light coming from its host star. We have explored this effect using a hierarchy of models. We find that terrestrial planets orbiting stars with higher near-UV radiation exhibit a stronger ice-albedo feedback. At a fixed level of CO2, M-dwarf planets remain free of global ice cover with larger decreases in stellar flux than planets orbiting hotter, brighter stars. At the outer edge of the habitable zone, where CO2 is expected to increase, the spectral dependence of surface ice and snow albedo is less important, and does not extend the traditional outer edge of the habitable zone given by the maximum CO2 greenhouse.

Using ""nested phasor diagrams,"" which use nesting to increase the dimensionality of graphic space, we taught undergraduate students to represent spin-1/2 states graphically as well as algebraically. In oral exams, students were asked to identify which spin-1/2 states, expressed numerically, would generate the same set of probabilities as each other (i.e., they are the same except for a different overall phase factor).

In this study, we have examined humor use in a classroom and how it supports student learning and classroom social dynamics. Because humor is highly individualistic, we cannot tell you best practices for humor use in the classroom. Instead, we propose some ways to attend to how humor is used and how it can impact classroom learning in nuanced and unexpected ways. Using observations of an upper-division thermal physics course over a semester, we have identified some practices with elements of humor. We will provide examples of how these practices lower the stakes for participation, invite learners to be valued/legitimate members of the classroom community, and support identity development as scientists.",None

An important instructional goal is to teach students to solve problems using physical representations. Yet, while experts use representations fluently and productively, novices often struggle to interpret them and may not value their utility. In addressing this, we use conceptual blending theory and distributed cognition to gain insight into how meaning and computational power arise from the material and conceptual features of representations. In this talk, we apply these ideas to understanding how students create and use external representations for solving problems. In particular, we discuss how conflicts among material and conceptual elements of representations may lead students to misuse or misunderstand external representations, and how looking for such conflicts may help to identify potential areas of student difficulties.",None

The student's question of ""where does the energy go?"" generally relies upon our describing immeasurable loss mechanisms such as deformation of the object and sound. But that description is a telling rather than the students' discovery. What if the students could perform an investigation that allows them to see what happens to the energy?

By weighing film canisters with a finite number of marbles hidden inside, the same analysis can be applied to determine the ""unit mass"" of an individual marble. The experiment is simple to execute, very little equipment is needed, and students are challenged to deduce an analysis method that will yield an accurate result.
