A particular challenge is that most programs serve pre-service teachers with a range of disciplinary specialties. Is it best to measure science teacher knowledge within individuals' science specialty, or can this be measured domain-generally for the sciences? In our physics education research, we investigated this question by developing a physics-specific measure of science teacher knowledge. We then conducted an experiment in which we randomly administered a domain-general measure or the parallel physics-specific measure to a population of pre-service science teachers. We also observed the teaching practices of a subset of participants in order to contribute to the validity of these measures' interpretations. The empirical evidence gathered serves to further develop the Flexible Application of Student-Centered Instruction (FASCI) instrument, and contributes to our understanding of science teachers' pedagogical content knowledge.",sponsor: Valerie K.

This study uses multiple regression to examine the responses of 3829 students from 34 randomly selected U.S. colleges. Confirming the importance of identity for young persons' occupational choices, a measure representing students' physics identity is found to be strongly correlated to their intended choice of a career in physics. Physics identity, in turn, is positively predicted by several high school physics experiences with a single factor exhibiting a differential effect for females and males.

We present guiding principles for such talk to increase the potential for making those experiences meaningful. Piaget showed that children are inquisitive creatures with considerable ability to observe and a strong desire to understand. Through interactions with other people and the outside world, children construct understandings and explanations for their observations. We argue that to guide students toward canonical scientific understanding, their nave beliefs and natural curiosity should be tapped. Students possess natural sense-making resources that increase their chances for authentic and significant scientific understanding. One approach to making sense in specific subject areas is through interactions with multiple representations of phenomena. A repertoire of representations can guide children toward aspects of the underlying principles while developing important habits of inquiry. In this poster/paper, we expand upon these ideas and offer guidelines for talking about science with children.",None

The degree of complexity for each problem is highly linear-regressed to the rate of correct answers. But the degree of complexity is not valid to explain the result of conceptual problems.",None

An alternative explanation for why students struggle with questions about proportional reasoning is that they do not recognize the tasks that are used to measure these skills as being about making sense of proportions. In this view, almost all students have the ability to reason about proportion, but the format of the questions that are asked and of the circumstances in which they are asked does not ""cue"" appropriate associations. At New Mexico State University and Western Washington University, we have been conducting investigations into the student reasoning about ratios and proportions. In this poster, we present results from these investigations, including data from initial experiments that are intended to distinguish between the two hypotheses described above. Populations involved in the study include students in university physics courses for nonscience majors as well as students in the algebra- and calculus-based introductory physics courses.",None

An outstanding question underlying gene regulation is how a particular protein recognizes its specific binding site on DNA. Many specific binding proteins bend or kink DNA at these sites, and the protein also undergoes extensive conformational rearrangements. These concerted changes in proteins and DNA are key to the recognition process. To elucidate the molecular mechanism, it is essential to study the dynamics of the conformational rearrangements that lead to the precise recognition. We use laser temperature-jump to disturb the protein-DNA complex, and fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor the conformational dynamics.

Each guide includes a short series of activities to assist students in developing requisite lab skills. Specific goals and content coverage for each lab meeting are achieved by selecting activities from two or three Quick Guides. For example, an exploration of springs may include activities from each of the ""Force Probe,"" ""Springs and Spring Energy,"" and ""Graphing with LoggerPro"" Quick Guides. A major advantage of the Quick Guides is the ability to tailor activities for a particular course (algebra- versus calculus-based), or even a particular section of the course.

Procedure: After the design of the cooling system was complete, final checks and renderings were performed to ensure that its components were accurate and consisted of no defects. A model magnetohydrodynamic drive (using salt water) was then developed to test the mathematical and theoretical backbone of magnetohydrodynamics. Neodymium magnets were placed under an array of tubing. Aluminum electrodes were also placed perpendicular to the magnets on the interior walls of the tubing. The top layer of the tubing was then cut off, allowing the process of magnetohydrodynamics to be clearly seen. Conclusion: It was concluded from the data observed throughout the experiment that a magnetohydrodynamic cooling system could work more efficiently to transfer thermal energy from a microprocessor than current cooling systems. A cooling system is only as good as the heat capacity of the substance it uses for heat dispersion. If operational (using equations and labs), the magnetohydrodynamic cooling system could work more efficiently because the substances it could use to transfer heat (liquid metals, liquid semiconductors, ionized bases, and aqueous substances) have a much higher heat capacity than current cooling substances.",None

This is particularly a big problem at the Historically Black Colleges and Universities, where a large number of remedial math course sections are offered to meet the growing demand. For most of these students, graduation is delayed by at least a year. In addition, these students continue to be taught by teaching methodologies that did not work for them even in high schools, resulting in disgust and hatred for math. This situation makes entry for these students into STEM areas difficult and is the perfect recipe for failure in STEM disciplines if they enroll in college-level courses. Because of this situation, recruiting and retaining majors in physics has become a major problem for the physics community. The situation, however, is worse when it comes to the recruitment and retaining of minority students as physics majors. The authors will present the results of three research studies we have carried out at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) during the summers of 2006, 2007, and 2008. At UDC, we believe that we are close to a solution of this problem. The five steps that stand out in recruiting and retaining physics majors will be discussed in detail. Specifically, the steps are: (1) closing the GAP in algebra during summers; (2) offering freshman teaching assistantships to potential science majors; (3) advising students in complementary courses; (4) providing academic course assistance throughout their freshman year; and (5) providing academic parenting during the critical freshman year and beyond.",None

The challenge to overcome is the nature in which four-credit hour science courses are typically taught -- lecturing for three credit hours with a one-credit hour lab each week. The fluid nature in planning astronomical observations is such that maintaining the typical four-hour lecture/lab paradigm is untenable. The observational astronomy course taught at Virginia Military Institute follows a model that overcomes both the static nature typically encountered in lectures and sporadic nature of observations by incorporating an extensive number of hands-on exercises intimately related to the observational and data reduction aspects of astronomy. The result is that students are actively engaged in learning and knowledge sharing that increase a student's confidence of knowledge in observational astronomy.,None

Further, there is a limit to how much current can flow ? the limiting current density is given by the charge density times the local sound speed. This combination of low resistance and finite current severely restricts the voltage differences that can exist, and hence, by Faraday's law, the speed at which a current element in the solar atmosphere can cross magnetic field lines.

(J.C. Maxwell ) Biographical material has to be based on concrete facts, and should constitute a part of the logical presentation of the information offered by the teacher. The deep understanding of the most important fundamental ideas, laws, and theories in the secondary school course of physics can often be achieved only by describing the scientist's road to discovery. For example, understanding the essence and significance of Newtonian mechanics can be achieved only by familiarizing the students with the history of overcoming Aristotelian ideas in physics. In this case ""controversy over generations"" between Aristotle and Galileo is the basic ground in studying of Newton's first law and Galileo's principle of relativity. In general, biographical material stimulates mastering the difficulties of the educational material by the students (especially by those for whom physics is their weak point). In this case, the explanation of new material should start from an illustrative example, showing the scientist's inventiveness, his diligence, and persistence in achieving the goal, etc. It is important to familiarize the students (especially those who like physics) with the style of the scientist's thinking. In their study of fundamental experimental discoveries and theories, the students' attention should be concentrated on the search for the right solution, on the hopes and doubts that characterize the creative process, on the evaluation of the discovery by the scientist himself--all this knowledge enables the students to develop the qualities of a future researcher.This approach to teaching helps the student to learn the scientific method in physics.","Genrikh Golin, Touro College, New York; genrikhgolin@yahoo.com"

Students get a feel for the accumulation of statistics as they collect their own data over several trials, and they observe the results converging to a particular answer when a large statistical sample is obtained by combining the class data. For the MH problem, students are often surprised at the counter-intuitive result that their own simulation of the process reveals.",None

Working in conjunction with the physics department, CU Boulder's School of Education offers a sister PER program through its Science Education doctoral track. A cornerstone of each of these two graduate tracks is a core graduate course in PER: Teaching and Learning Physics. This course coordinates theories, research, pedagogical approaches, and curricula developed in PER. Throughout the course students are engaged in a practicum in which they conduct research on teaching and learning that forms the basis of a semester-long project and provides students a framework to evaluate current PER reforms. CU offers a variety of formal and informal structures that support graduate preparation in PER and extend beyond coursework, such as weekly group meetings, informal reading groups, and a broader discipline-based educational research group.

Most (11 in 19) students consistently constructed propositional representation across the two topics.

The test items developed by Lopes and Costa(2007) have been revised. The subject is 59 high-achievers of the seventh and eighth grades. The results show that most of the students are in low levels of learning progression for modeling. They have difficulties in relating various model components with appropriate laws in modeling. They cant figure out agents that interact with objects. Thus they fail to construct models with appropriate interaction in causal facet.",None

To determine the dominant mechanism for attenuation, we measured eight specimens of human and bovine bone ranging in density from 0.142-0.259 g/cc. Measurements were first performed with the specimens in water (with water filling the porous regions) and then in ethanol.

AAPT and AIP are leading a group of physical science organizations to propose a set of physical science education policy priorities in anticipation of Congress's reauthorization of No Child Left Behind, the major U.S. law governing K-12 education in the U.S. These priorities will guide our communications to Congress, yet in the current political climate, we need to balance this national approach with serious local, grass-roots mobilization of our community. In other words, physics teachers need to become active agents of political change in their community and engage their members of Congress to illustrate the local impact of decisions made in D.C. This talk will summarize the current federal budget situation, outline policy priorities for physical science education, and provide tips for becoming an active local proponent for public policies that improve physics education in the U.S.",None

Ranging from editor-created resource collections for physical science topics to active learning in upper-level physics classes and from our members' personal collections to partnerships with curriculum developers, this talk will highlight some examples of how the ComPADRE technology impacts the teaching and learning of physics.","This work is supported, in part, by NSF grants 0937836, 0532798, 0226192"
Session:,Astronomy Research at the Small Observatory,Invited,Title:,Selected Research Projects from the West Mountain Observatory,Meeting:,"2012 Winter Meeting: Ontario, California",Location:,Room 203AB,Date:,,<b> Time: </b>,1:15PM,<b> Author: </b>,"Michael D Joner, Brigham Young University",<b> Co-Author(s): </b>,None,"The West Mountain Observatory is a small facility located away from most city lights at an elevation of almost 7000 feet approximately 20 miles southwest of the main campus of Brigham Young University. The observatory currently houses three small reflecting telescopes (0.3-m, 0.5-m, and 0.9-m) equipped with a variety of standard and custom filters and CCD detectors that allow for a wide range of astrophysical imaging projects at optical wavelengths. These projects are currently being pursued by undergraduates, graduates, and faculty observers at BYU. In addition, the WMO observers have been providing research quality data to support selected projects proposed by external investigators. This presentation will summarize the facilities and typical conditions available at the West Mountain Observatory, describe the work done by research observers, and present several examples of projects that have been done using these modest resources. We conclude with a brief description of possible future additions to the instrumentation in order to expand the scope of work that can be done at West Mountain. http://wmo.byu.edu",None

Richmond, Rochester Institute of Technology",<b> Co-Author(s): </b>,None,"Just because small telescopes (8 to 16 inches in diameter) at suburban locations cannot acquire spectra of high-redshift quasars does not mean that they doomed to taking pretty pictures. Small telescopes equipped with CCD cameras can carry out a number of projects that are both within the grasp of a dedicated student and interesting to the astronomical community. I will provide examples of projects involving variable stars, supernovae, asteroids, and exoplanets. Many of these projects require only a few nights of measurements, making them well suited for advanced projects at the end of a course on observational astronomy.",None
Session:,Undergraduate Research and Two-Year Colleges,Invited,Title:,Mentoring Student Research at the Two Year College.,Meeting:,"2012 Winter Meeting: Ontario, California",Location:,Room 103,Date:,,<b> Time: </b>,7:00PM,<b> Author: </b>,"Martin S. Mason, Mt. San Antonio College",<b> Co-Author(s): </b>,None,"Over the past decade our program has placed a strong emphasis on student research by offering research courses for credit, hosting an annual research conference for lower division STEM students, providing seminars and mentoring on applying for summer REU programs, building collaborations with local four-year institutions to place students in research opportunities, and having active faculty research programs on campus that are accessible to lower division students. This emphasis on student research grows out of the project-based orientation of the introductory physics courses which provide a template for independent student work. An active student research program has helped to create increased interest and retention in STEM majors, an increase in transfer to R1 programs and a reinvigoration of faculty.",None
Session:,Frontiers in Space Exploration,Invited,Title:,The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX),Meeting:,"2012 Winter Meeting: Ontario, California",Location:,Room 202AB,Date:,,<b> Time: </b>,6:30PM,<b> Author: </b>,David J. McComas,<b> Co-Author(s): </b>,None,"The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) remotely observes the global interaction of our heliosphere (the region dominated by the Sun) with the local interstellar medium. IBEX provided the first all-sky maps of Energetic Neutral Atoms (ENAs) emanating from the heliospheric boundaries at energies from ~0.1-6 keV. The IBEX team discovered a smoothly varying, globally distributed ENA flux overlaid by a narrow ""ribbon"" of significantly enhanced ENA emissions. Since the publication of these results (Science, 2009) IBEX discovered time variations in the interaction, separated the ribbon from distributed fluxes, inferred ion source temperatures, and carried out many other observational and theoretical studies of the outer heliosphere. In addition, IBEX made the first observations of ENAs produced by backscatter and neutralization of the solar wind from the lunar regolith and provided the first energy and angle resolved ENA images of the subsolar magnetosheath, magnetospheric cusps, and terrestrial plasma sheet.",None
